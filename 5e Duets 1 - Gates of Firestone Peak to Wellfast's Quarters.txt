I have added new files to the Knowledge Base for this project. Are you able to 
access them?
Nov 30
Yes, I can access the files in your project's Knowledge Base! Let me search to 
see what's available.
Searched project for "files documents content overview"

Yes, I can definitely access your project files! I can see you have several D&D-
related documents in the Knowledge Base, including:
1.	D&D 5e System Reference Document (SRD 5.1) - The core rules 
and mechanics
2.	The Penshaw Poisonings - A one-on-one D&D adventure module
3.	One-on-One D&D guides - Articles about how to run and play duet 
(one-on-one) D&D games
4.	Information about scaling combat and encounters for single-player 
games
5.	Content about the World of Azuria (a homebrew setting)
The files cover topics like creating adventures for one-on-one play, using 
sidekicks, adapting encounters, and running duet campaigns.
Is there something specific you'd like me to help you with using these 
resources? I can answer questions about the content, help you plan 
encounters, create adventures, or work with the mechanics from the SRD!
I'd like to begin a run through of Gates of Firestorm Peak using the 5e SRD 
rules. I will create a character of my own to begin.
Nov 30
Excellent! I'd be happy to run you through Gates of Firestorm Peak using 5e 
rules. This is a classic adventure, and it should work well adapted to 5e 
mechanics.
Let me search the knowledge base for the Gates of Firestorm Peak content so I 
can familiarize myself with the adventure details.

Perfect! I can see the Gates of Firestorm Peak adventure. This is a classic 
module about an ancient elven fortress built around a dimensional gate that's 
been reopened by a comet's return. The adventure involves exploring the 
mountain to stop an evil conjurer named Madreus before he permanently 
opens the Vast Gate to the Far Realm.
Before we begin, let's create your character! For a one-on-one adventure like 
this, we'll want to make sure your character is well-rounded and can handle 
various challenges. Based on the duet resources in the knowledge base, we 
may also want to consider giving you a sidekick companion to help with action 
economy.
What I need from you to create your character:
1.	Class - What class would you like to play?
2.	Race - What race appeals to you?
3.	Background - Do you have a background concept in mind?
4.	Ability Scores - Would you like to use standard array (15, 14, 13, 12, 
10, 8), point buy, or roll for stats?
5.	Starting Level - The adventure mentions this is suitable for mid-level 
characters. I'd suggest starting at level 5-7. What sounds good to you?
Also, would you like me to create a sidekick NPC to accompany you, or would 
you prefer to adventure solo (which is more challenging but doable)?
I'll play a human variant 6th level Warlock, using the Soldier background. Let's 
roll for stats (I typically use the house rule of rolling 3 sets of stats and 
choosing which one to keep.
Nov 30
Excellent choice! A 6th level Warlock with military experience should be very 
interesting for this adventure. Let me roll 3 sets of ability scores for you.
Rolling 3 sets of ability scores using 4d6 drop lowest
Great rolls! Here are your three options:
Set 1: [15, 10, 12, 15, 6, 13] - Total: 71, Average: 11.83
*	Has a low 6, but two 15s could work well
Set 2: [15, 12, 15, 14, 16, 14] - Total: 86, Average: 14.33
*	Excellent set! Very well-rounded with high scores
Set 3: [8, 9, 10, 18, 13, 11] - Total: 69, Average: 11.50
*	Has that awesome 18, but several low scores
Set 2 looks outstanding - it gives you great flexibility and no dump stats. 
Which set would you like to use?
Once you choose, we'll need to determine:
1.	Warlock Patron (Archfey, Fiend, Great Old One, etc.)
2.	Pact Boon (Chain, Blade, or Tome - you get this at level 3)
3.	Spells known and Invocations
4.	Equipment from your Soldier background
5.	Your character's name and personality
Also, given this is a one-on-one adventure, would you like a sidekick 
companion? The knowledge base recommends this for action economy in duet 
play.
Yes, let's use Set 2.
Nov 30
Excellent! Set 2 gives you [15, 12, 15, 14, 16, 14] to work with.
Now let's build out your 6th level Human Variant Warlock:
Ability Score Assignment: As a Warlock, you'll want Charisma as your 
primary stat, and Constitution is important for survivability. Where would you 
like to assign these scores?
My suggestion for a Warlock would be:
*	Charisma: 16 (+1 from Variant Human = 17)
*	Constitution: 15 (+1 from Variant Human = 16)
*	Dexterity: 15 (for AC and initiative)
*	Wisdom: 14 (for perception and saves)
*	Intelligence: 14 (solid for investigation/knowledge)
*	Strength: 12 (fits your soldier background)
Does this work for you, or would you prefer a different arrangement?
Next, we need to determine:
1.	Warlock Patron - Which otherworldly being grants you power?
*	The Fiend (fire/dark power)
*	The Archfey (fey magic and charm)
*	The Great Old One (telepathy and mind-affecting powers - 
thematically interesting given this adventure involves the Far 
Realm!)
*	Other options if you have access to other sourcebooks
2.	Pact Boon (gained at 3rd level):
*	Pact of the Chain (special familiar)
*	Pact of the Blade (magical weapon)
*	Pact of the Tome (extra cantrips and rituals)
3.	Variant Human Feat - You get a free feat! What would you like?
What are you thinking for these choices?
Which feats might be the most advantageous considering the constraints of a 
duet setting?
Nov 30
Searched project for "duet one-on-one PC adaptations empowered feats 
abilities"
1 result
Great question! Based on the duet mechanics guidance, here are the most 
advantageous feats for a one-on-one setting:
Top Tier for Duets:
1.	War Caster - Absolutely essential for a Warlock in duet play
*	Advantage on concentration saves (crucial when you're a primary 
damage dealer)
*	Cast spells as opportunity attacks
*	Can perform somatic components with weapons/shield in hand
2.	Resilient (Constitution) - Excellent survivability
*	+1 to CON (making your 15 ? 16)
*	Proficiency in CON saves for concentration
3.	Lucky - Action economy saver
*	Reroll critical failures when you're the only PC
*	Can turn the tide of deadly encounters
Strong Second Tier:
4.	Alert - Never being surprised is huge when outnumbered
*	+5 to initiative means you act first to control the battlefield
*	Can't be surprised
5.	Sentinel - If you take Pact of the Blade
*	Helps control enemies and protect your sidekick
Given your high CON (15) and that you're a caster who will be concentrating 
on key spells, I'd strongly recommend War Caster as your Variant 
Human feat. It will keep your concentration spells up when you get hit, which 
is critical in duet play where you have fewer party members to share the 
damage.
Does War Caster sound good to you? And have you thought about 
which Patron and Pact Boon you'd like?
Pact of the Blade, Fiend Patron. War Caster feat
Nov 30
Perfect! A Pact of the Blade Warlock with a Fiend Patron - you'll be a 
formidable warrior with dark powers. War Caster is an excellent choice for 
keeping your concentration up in the thick of combat.
Let me finalize your character sheet:

RECOMMENDED SPELL SELECTIONS for Pact of the Blade 
Warlock in a duet:
Cantrips:
*	Mage Hand (utility)
*	Minor Illusion (versatility)
*	Prestidigitation (utility)
Spells:
*	Hex (1st) - Extra damage, essential for blade warlocks
*	Hellish Rebuke (1st) - Reaction damage when hit
*	Armor of Agathys (1st, if available) or Shield - Actually these aren't 
on the warlock list in the SRD
*	Mirror Image (2nd) - Defensive, crucial for melee
*	Misty Step (2nd) - Mobility
*	Hold Person (2nd) - Control/auto-crits in melee
*	Counterspell (3rd) - Essential utility
*	Fly (3rd) - Mobility and tactical advantage
Would you like these recommendations, or would you prefer to customize 
your spell selection?
Which of the cantrips are concentration-sensitive
Nov 30
None of the Warlock cantrips require concentration! Cantrips are instant-
effect spells, so you can freely use them without worrying about breaking 
concentration on your important spells like Hex, Hold Person, or any other 
concentration spell you cast.
This is great for your build because it means you can:
*	Spam Eldritch Blast every turn while maintaining Hex
*	Use Mage Hand, Minor Illusion, or Prestidigitation for utility without 
any concentration concerns
The concentration concern is really about your leveled spells. From the 
recommended list, these require concentration:
*	Hex (1st level) - Very important for damage
*	Hold Person (2nd level) - Great for auto-crits
*	Mirror Image (2nd level) - Does NOT require concentration 
(defensive buff)
*	Fly (3rd level) - Requires concentration
This is why War Caster is such a strong choice - it gives you advantage on 
Constitution saves to maintain concentration when you get hit, which will 
happen often as a Pact of the Blade melee combatant.
My recommended cantrip trio:
1.	Eldritch Blast (your main ranged attack)
2.	Mage Hand (30 ft range utility - open doors, retrieve items, 
manipulate objects from safety)
3.	Minor Illusion or Prestidigitation (creative problem-solving and 
social encounters)
Does that cantrip selection work for you? And are you good with the 
recommended spell list, or would you like to adjust it?
I like 1 and 2, lets go with minor illusion for 3.
Nov 30
Perfect! Eldritch Blast, Mage Hand, and Minor Illusion - a solid 
combination of combat power, utility, and creative problem-solving.
Now for your 6 leveled spells - are you good with my recommendations?
1.	Hex (1st) - Bonus damage on every hit
2.	Hellish Rebuke (1st) - Punish enemies who hit you
3.	Mirror Image (2nd) - Defense without concentration
4.	Misty Step (2nd) - Bonus action teleport
5.	Hold Person (2nd) - Paralyze humanoids, auto-crit in melee
6.	Counterspell (3rd) - Shut down enemy spells
Or would you like to swap any of these out for something else like Fly, 
Invisibility, Darkness (synergizes with Devil's Sight!), Hypnotic Pattern, 
Fear, Vampiric Touch, etc.?
Also, we need to finalize a few more details:
Equipment from Soldier background:
*	An insignia of rank
*	A trophy from a fallen enemy
*	Gaming set or playing card set
*	Common clothes
*	Belt pouch with 10 gp
Starting Warlock Equipment choices:
*	Light crossbow + 20 bolts OR simple weapon?
*	Component pouch OR arcane focus?
*	Scholar's pack OR dungeoneer's pack?
*	You also get leather armor, a simple weapon, and two daggers
Finally, and most importantly:
*	Character name?
*	Brief backstory - What led you to make a pact with a Fiend? What's 
your military background?
*	Would you like a sidekick companion for this adventure?
Light crossbow, arcane focus, dungeoneer pack, leather armor, short sword, nd 
aggers. Name: Johannes Constantinius, my company was out on patrol and 
stumbled onto a lost grotto. Despite our misgivings, we entered the cave and 
found a book. Being the only literate one in the group, I opened it, 
inadvertently summoning demon. The rest of the company was slaughtered, I 
was left alive to be a plaything for the fiend. I managed to find a wiard who 
has "freed" me from its direct influence, but unless I find objects it desires, it 
kills those around me to extract "payment" for my delay. I have spent the rest 
of my life seeking for things to placate it while I try and find a more 
permanent solution (i.e., something capable of killing or permanently 
banishing it. I definitely need a sidekick...suggestions?
Nov 30
Excellent backstory, Johannes! That's dark, compelling, and gives great 
motivation for adventuring. The constant threat of your fiend patron claiming 
those around you adds real tension and urgency to your quest.
For a sidekick, let me search the knowledge base for guidance on creating 
effective companions for duet play:
Searched project for "sidekick companion NPC duet one-on-one central party"
3 results
Perfect! Based on the duet guidance, here are my sidekick suggestions for 
Johannes:
Option 1: The Cleric/Healer (RECOMMENDED)
*	Name: Brother Aldric or Sister Maren
*	Concept: A traveling priest/priestess who recognizes your cursed 
nature and has made it their mission to help you find redemption and 
freedom from the fiend
*	Benefits: Healing, support magic, can help with undead (common in 
dungeons), provides moral counterbalance to your dark patron
*	Narrative fit: They believe saving you from damnation is their holy 
calling
Option 2: The Tank/Fighter
*	Name: Gareth Ironshield
*	Concept: A former soldier from your old company who survived 
(barely) and blames himself for not stopping you from opening the 
book. Travels with you out of guilt/loyalty
*	Benefits: Absorbs damage, protects you in melee while you cast, 
straightforward combat
*	Narrative fit: Living reminder of your past, complicated relationship
Option 3: The Rogue/Scout
*	Name: Sylas "Whisper"
*	Concept: A rogue who once tried to steal from you, discovered your 
secret, and now helps you acquire the "tributes" your patron demands
*	Benefits: Skills you lack (Stealth, Thieves' Tools, Sleight of Hand), 
ranged damage
*	Narrative fit: Morally flexible ally who understands desperate 
bargains
My recommendation: The Cleric - they complement your Warlock 
perfectly. You lack healing, and they provide it. You have damage and utility, 
they have support and healing. Narratively, the tension between your fiendish 
pact and their divine calling adds great roleplay opportunities.
Which appeals to you? Or would you like a different concept entirely?
Argh, these all sound great!
Nov 30
Haha, I know the feeling! They each bring something unique to the table.
Here's a thought - since you're going into Gates of Firestorm Peak, which 
involves:
*	An ancient elven fortress
*	A dimensional gate to the Far Realm
*	Lots of dungeon crawling and combat
*	Duergar (gray dwarves), aberrations, and extraplanar threats
*	A 28-day time limit before disaster strikes
I'd lean toward the Cleric (Option 1) for pure survival and practicality. 
You'll need healing badly in extended dungeon exploration, and divine magic 
can handle undead and aberrations well. Plus, the roleplay dynamic of a holy 
person helping someone bound to a fiend is chef's kiss.
However, if you want maximum dramatic tension with your backstory, the 
Fighter (Option 2) - the survivor from your company - would be absolutely 
devastating emotionally. Every time they save your life, there's that unspoken 
weight of "you got the others killed."
Quick decision method:
*	Want to survive longer and have tactical flexibility? ? Cleric
*	Want maximum emotional drama and simpler combat? ? Fighter
*	Want a morally gray tomb-raiding vibe? ? Rogue
What does your gut say? Or I can create whichever one you pick - just tell me 
which number (1, 2, or 3) and I'll build them out as a 6th level character to 
match Johannes!
Let's combine 1 and 3 in the form of a bard? The stealing elements of the thief 
and healing like a cleric?
Nov 30
Brilliant! A Bard is perfect - they get healing (Cure Wounds, Healing Word), 
lots of skills and utility, and can fill that morally-flexible treasure-hunter role 
beautifully. Plus they add battlefield control and support magic that 
complements your damage-focused Warlock.
Let me create your sidekick bard:

BACKSTORY: Kessa "Keys" Darrow is a smooth-talking treasure hunter and 
con artist who tried to pickpocket Johannes at a tavern two years ago. She got 
more than she bargained for - a glimpse of the infernal contract binding him, 
written in hellfire on his very soul.
Instead of running, she saw opportunity. Kessa has always chased forbidden 
knowledge and dangerous artifacts, and helping Johannes acquire "tributes" 
for his patron has led her to ruins and relics she'd never have found otherwise. 
She tells herself it's purely professional, but she's grown genuinely fond of 
Johannes and harbors secret guilt about profiting from his curse.
She's charming, irreverent, and excellent at talking her way out of (or into) 
trouble. Her healing magic comes from a brief apprenticeship with a traveling 
priest she conned, then actually learned from before moving on.
Personality:
*	Quick with a joke or deflection
*	Morally flexible but loyal to those she cares about
*	Secretly believes everyone has an angle
*	Uses humor to cope with darkness
*	Will steal from the rich, lie to the powerful, but never abandons a friend
 
Does Kessa work for you? Any adjustments you'd like to her personality, 
backstory, or mechanics?
Sounds perfect!
Nov 30
Excellent! Johannes and Kessa make a great team - the cursed soldier and the 
charming rogue with a heart of gold(ish).
Let me create a quick character summary document for both of you, then we 
can begin the adventure!
Creating character sheets for Johannes and Kessa
character_sheets.txt
Perfect! Your party is ready. Now let's begin Gates of Firestorm Peak!
 
GATES OF FIRESTORM PEAK - OPENING
The Dragon's Tear comet has returned to the night sky after 27 years, blazing 
crimson across the northern heavens. For weeks now, strange reports have 
filtered south from the remote mountain regions - violent storms, maddened 
wildlife, whispers of gates opening in an ancient peak.
You and Kessa sit in a weathered tavern in the village of Longbridge, three 
days' journey from Firestorm Peak itself. The locals speak in hushed tones 
about the mountain, about celebrations called "Firefestivals" when the comet 
appears, about gates of unbreakable crystal that some claim have opened once 
more.
Kessa leans back in her chair, boots on the table, idly shuffling a deck of cards. 
"So, Johannes," she says quietly, keeping her voice low. "That thing you're 
bound to has been... restless lately. More demanding. I'm guessing it wants 
something from up north?"
She's right. For the past week, you've felt the fiend's hunger growing, its 
whispers more insistent. It wants something powerful, something ancient. 
And every instinct tells you that what it seeks lies within Firestorm Peak.
Before we begin proper, a few questions:
1.	How do you want to handle your pact weapon? What form does 
it typically take when you summon it?
2.	What's your relationship like with Kessa? Friendly banter? Tense 
partnership? Genuine friendship beneath the business arrangement?
3.	Do you have any specific goals beyond placating your 
patron? Are you actively seeking a way to break free?
Pact weapon - the shortsword carried by the company commander; it comes 
when I invoke his name. Genuine friendship - no romantic undertones or 
anything like that. More like bro and sis.... If I can survive this adventure, I 
would like to continue exploring other options with Johannes, so maybe a 
single hint or item that could point toward a level 20 conclusion, so nothing 
official or solving at this point. Does that make sense?
Nov 30
Perfect! That all makes complete sense. The pact weapon having that tragic 
connection to your fallen commander is beautifully dark - every time you 
summon it, you're invoking the name of someone who died because of you. 
Very fitting for a Fiend pact.
I love the sibling dynamic with Kessa - that'll create great banter and genuine 
care without romantic complications.
And yes, absolutely - I'll seed in a hint or clue about something that could lead 
to breaking your pact, maybe a reference to a powerful artifact, ancient ritual, 
or entity that could theoretically free you. Something to plant seeds for a 
longer campaign arc without resolving anything now. This adventure will be 
about survival and the immediate crisis, but you'll find a thread to follow.
 
THE TAVERN - LONGBRIDGE
Kessa's eyes flick to the entrance as an old man shuffles into the tavern. He's 
bundled in furs despite the summer warmth, and his weathered face is drawn 
with worry. The locals immediately quiet as he approaches the bar.
"Elekgong," someone mutters. "The hermit from the mountain pass."
The old man's voice carries across the suddenly silent room. "The gates are 
open again. Twenty-seven years, and they've opened again. I saw four fools go 
in last time - watched them walk right through those crystal gates. Never came 
back. Not a one."
Kessa sits up, boots hitting the floor. She catches your eye with a meaningful 
look.
The bartender slides the old man an ale. "How long have the gates been open, 
Elek?"
"Three days now. Maybe four. Hard to tell time up there - storms like nothing 
natural. Animals gone mad. The very air feels wrong." He takes a long drink. 
"Whatever you young folk are planning, don't go up that mountain. Nothing 
good waits in Firestorm Peak."
Kessa leans toward you, voice barely a whisper. "Four people went in twenty-
seven years ago and never came out. Want to bet one of them was carrying 
something your 'friend' downstairs wants?"
She's probably right. Your patron's hunger has grown acute, focused. It wants 
something specific.
What do you do?
The idea is that each adventure is disconnected from the others other than the 
PC and the hope to finally find the solution, so it is entirely plausible any given 
adventure might have nothing to add...
Nov 30
Ah, perfect! I understand completely now. Each adventure is episodic - 
Johannes and Kessa chase leads, acquire tributes for the fiend, and survive. 
Sometimes there's a hint toward freedom, sometimes not. No guarantee this 
particular adventure will have "the answer" - it's just another desperate 
attempt to stay alive and keep the demon fed.
That's a great structure - keeps the tension high because you never know if this 
quest will be the breakthrough or just another temporary fix.

She's probably right. Your patron's hunger has grown acute, focused. It wants 
something specific. Whether it's related to those four lost souls or something 
else entirely within that ancient elven fortress, you'll only know once you're 
inside.
The old hermit, Elekgong, drains his ale and sets the mug down heavily. 
Through the tavern window, you can see the crimson comet hanging in the 
northern sky like a bleeding wound.
Kessa pulls out a small notebook, flipping to a sketch she's made of the 
mountain from descriptions. "Crystal gates, ancient elven construction, opens 
every time that comet shows up. Sounds like exactly the kind of place where 
powerful artifacts get locked away." She grins. "Also sounds incredibly 
dangerous. My favorite kind of treasure hunt."
She glances at you more seriously. "You feeling it? The pull?"
You are. That familiar, sickening tug of your patron's will, drawing you north 
toward Firestorm Peak like a lodestone.
What do you do? Do you:
*	Approach Elekgong to ask him more questions about the mountain?
*	Head out immediately toward Firestorm Peak (3 days' journey)?
*	Spend time in Longbridge gathering supplies or information?
*	Something else?
Offer to buy Elekgong a drink and pump him for information via Kessa's 
charms
Nov 30
Excellent plan - let Kessa work her magic while you observe.
 
Kessa flashes you a knowing grin and slides out of her seat with practiced 
grace. She saunters up to the bar, signaling the bartender. "Another round for 
our friend Elekgong here - on us." She settles onto the stool beside him, 
turning on that easy charm. "I'm Kessa, and that's my companion Johannes 
over there."
The old hermit eyes her suspiciously at first, but when the fresh ale arrives, his 
expression softens slightly. Kessa leans in conspiratorially. "You've been up 
near Firestorm Peak a long time, haven't you? The locals seem to know you."
Elekgong grunts. "Aye. Got a trapline in the foothills. Been working those 
mountains for forty years, girl."
"Then you must have seen the gates open before - twenty-seven years ago. You 
mentioned four people who went in?" Kessa's tone is perfect - curious but not 
pushy, genuinely interested.
Kessa is making a Persuasion check to get information from 
Elekgong.
Rolling Kessa's Persuasion check
 
Elekgong relaxes considerably under Kessa's attention and the warmth of 
good ale. He nods slowly. "Aye, I saw 'em. Led by a man called himself Nigel - 
Conjurer, he said. Wizard type. Had three others with him: Derek the 
Warcaller, Quaren, and one other I don't recall."
He takes another drink. "Warned 'em, same as I'm warning you now. But 
Nigel, he knew things. Had researched the place, called it the 'Gate of Worlds,' 
said the Elder Elves built it as some kind of stronghold. Had notes about 
tremendous magical power."
Kessa leans in. "What happened to them?"
"Went right in through those crystal gates when they opened. I watched from a 
distance - even from half a mile away, the place felt wrong. The air crackles, 
storms come from nowhere, and the animals..." He shudders. "Birds attacking 
travelers, rabbits gone rabid. The mountain itself seems cursed when those 
gates open."
He fixes Kessa with a hard stare. "Never saw those four come out. When the 
comet disappeared and the gates closed after a month, I went up to check. 
Gates sealed tight - you could see through 'em, but they wouldn't budge. Hard 
as diamond, they are."
Kessa nods sympathetically. "That must have been terrible to witness. Tell me, 
Elekgong - in your forty years, have you ever heard stories about what's 
actually inside the mountain? What the Elder Elves were doing there?"
The old man glances around nervously and lowers his voice. "Rumors only. 
Trappers' tales. Some say the Elves opened a door to... somewhere else. 
Somewhere that shouldn't be opened. When they realized their mistake, they 
fled and sealed it all up. But the sealing wasn't perfect - it's tied to that 
damned comet somehow."
He leans even closer. "And there's worse now. Gray dwarves - Duergar - 
moved into the upper levels about fifteen years back. Mining something they 
call 'nephelium.' Nasty folk. They don't come down to trade, don't bother the 
villages, but any trappers who get too close to their territory disappear."
Johannes, you feel that pull from your patron intensify slightly at 
the mention of the Elder Elves' gate and the Duergar's nephelium. 
Whatever it wants is definitely in that mountain.
What do you want to ask or do next?
Anything hazardous between us and the Gates that stands out?
Nov 30
Good question - let Johannes speak up now.
 
You lean forward from your table, your voice cutting across the tavern's low 
murmur. "Elekgong - anything particularly dangerous between here and the 
gates themselves? Besides the mad animals?"
The old hermit turns to regard you, sizing you up with a trapper's experienced 
eye. He notes the way you carry yourself, the soldier's bearing, and grunts 
approvingly.
"Three days' journey north, like I said. First two days are standard mountain 
travel - steep trails, rocky terrain, but nothing a seasoned traveler can't 
handle. It's the last day that gets bad."
He pulls out a piece of charcoal and sketches roughly on the bar top. "About a 
day out from the peak, the storms start. Unnatural weather - sudden 
downpours, thunder that shakes your bones, then muggy heat that makes you 
feel like your skin's crawling. The air itself feels charged, like lightning's about 
to strike any moment. Your hair stands on end, goosebumps constant."
Kessa grimaces. "Sounds delightful."
"That's when the animals attack too. Not just avoiding you or warning you off - 
actively hunting you. Seen rabbits swarm a man once. Rabbits. And birds 
diving at eyes and faces." He shakes his head. "The closer you get to those 
gates, the worse it gets."
He takes another drink. "And if you're planning to camp near the mountain 
itself? The Duergar sometimes send out night raids. They hate the light, so 
they wait for darkness or heavy clouds. Had a friend who lost his whole camp 
to them - disappeared without a trace."
Elekgong fixes you both with a serious look. "My advice? Don't camp right 
outside the gates. Either make camp further down the mountain and approach 
in daylight, or get inside quick and find somewhere defensible within. The 
threshold between outside and inside is the most dangerous place to linger."
Kessa glances at you. "Charming. So we deal with psychotic woodland 
creatures, freak weather, and gray dwarf ambushes. Anything else we should 
know, Elek?"
The old man considers. "The gates themselves... last time I saw them open, 
they looked like they were made of glass or crystal. Completely transparent - 
you can see right through into the entrance corridor beyond. But when they're 
sealed, nothing gets through. Not picks, not hammers, not magic that I've seen 
tried."
He pauses. "Oh, and one more thing. Keep track of your days. That comet's 
going to be in the sky for about a month, maybe a bit more. When it fades, 
those gates close. If you're still inside..." He doesn't finish the sentence.
What do you want to do?
*	Ask more questions?
*	Prepare to depart for Firestorm Peak?
*	Gather supplies in Longbridge first?
*	Something else?
Let me to an investigation check to see if there's anything else that would 
occur to Johannes.
Nov 30
Good thinking - let's see what Johannes's military and investigative experience 
picks up on.
Rolling Johannes's Investigation check
 
You consider everything Elekgong has said, your military mind analyzing the 
tactical situation. A few things stand out:
What you piece together:
1.	Time Pressure: You have roughly 28 days before the gates close. 
That's important - you can't afford to get bogged down exploring every 
corner of this place. Your patron's pull will guide you, but you need to 
move with purpose.
2.	The Four Who Entered: Nigel was a Conjurer (specialist wizard), 
Derek the Warcaller (sounds like a fighter or warrior), Quaren, and one 
other. They went in 27 years ago and never came out. If they had 
valuable items or knowledge, those might still be in there - either on 
their remains or claimed by whatever killed them.
3.	Duergar Territory: The gray dwarves are mining "nephelium" in the 
upper levels. Your soldier's instinct tells you that means they've fortified 
positions, probably guard posts, and they know the terrain. Fighting 
through their territory could be costly.
4.	Entry Strategy: Elekgong's warning about not camping at the 
threshold makes sense. You'll want to either commit to going in 
immediately or camp well away from the gates.
5.	Supply Consideration: If you're going to be in there for potentially 
days or weeks, you'll need food, water, and a way to rest safely inside 
hostile territory.
You look at Elekgong. "This Nigel - did he or his companions have any notable 
equipment? Magical items, distinctive weapons?"
The old hermit scratches his chin. "Derek had a broadsword, I remember that 
- caught the light something fierce. And one of them had a ring... Nigel maybe? 
Or was it Derek? Memory's foggy after twenty-seven years." He shrugs 
apologetically.
Anything else you want to ask or investigate, or ready to prepare 
for the journey?
Let's get a month's worth of rations and waterand then head out.
Nov 30
Smart - better to be over-prepared.
 
You and Kessa spend the rest of the afternoon gathering supplies in 
Longbridge. The village isn't large, but it services trappers and travelers 
heading into the northern mountains, so the general store is well-stocked.
Purchases:
*	30 days of rations for two people (60 rations total) - 30 gp
*	Waterskins refilled (you each have one, should be sufficient with 
refilling from mountain streams)
*	50 feet of hempen rope - 1 gp (always useful in dungeons)
*	10 torches - 1 sp (backup to any light sources)
*	Healer's kit - 5 gp (Kessa insists, even though she has healing magic)
Total cost: 36 gp, 1 sp (split between you as you prefer)
 
The next morning, you set out at dawn. The crimson comet is still visible in the 
pale morning sky, a bloody smear across the heavens. The road north quickly 
becomes a trail, then little more than a game path winding up into the rocky 
foothills.
Day 1 of Travel:
The weather is clear and cool - perfect traveling conditions. Kessa walks beside 
you, occasionally humming old tavern songs or making observations about the 
landscape. She's in good spirits, clearly energized by the prospect of a proper 
treasure hunt.
"So," she says conversationally as you navigate a steep switchback, "what's 
your gut telling you about this one? Your... patron..." she always hesitates 
slightly on that word, "seems more insistent than usual. Think this is 
something big?"
The pull in your chest is constant now, a directional tug like a fisherman's line 
drawing you north and upward. Whatever the fiend wants, it's definitely in 
Firestorm Peak.
How do you respond? And how are you traveling - cautiously 
(slower but more aware), normal pace, or pushing hard to make 
good time?
Normal pace. There are no secrets, so i fully share anything and everything 
without pretense or subtrefuge
Nov 30
Good - that fits the sibling dynamic perfectly. No secrets between you two.
 
"It's different this time," you admit, adjusting your pack as you climb. "Usually 
there's just... hunger. Vague direction, growing pressure. But this?" You touch 
your chest where you can feel that infernal pull. "It's specific. Focused. Like 
the damn thing knows exactly what it wants and where it is."
Kessa nods, her expression growing more serious. "That's what worries me. 
When it's vague, we have options - grab something powerful, hope it's enough 
to buy you time. But if it wants something specific..." She trails off.
"Then I either get it, or people start dying," you finish flatly.
"Hey." She bumps your shoulder. "We've kept ahead of it for two years. We'll 
figure this out too."
You continue in companionable silence for a while, making good time on the 
trail. The mountains rise around you, pine forests giving way to rockier terrain 
as you gain elevation.
"You know what else bothers me?" Kessa muses. "Four experienced 
adventurers, including a wizard, went in twenty-seven years ago and never 
came out. Either they found what they were looking for and it killed them, or 
they got lost in there, or..." She pauses. "Or they're still in there somehow. 
Trapped, maybe. Or worse."
She glances at you. "If we find this Nigel's remains, or Derek's - you want me 
to try Speak with Dead? Might learn something useful about what's inside."
The day passes without incident. As the sun begins to set, you've 
covered good ground - roughly a third of the journey.
Do you:
*	Make camp here for the night?
*	Push on a bit further in the fading light?
*	Any specific camp preparations or watch arrangements?
Camp for the night. No particular arrangements
Nov 30
CAMP - END OF DAY 1
You find a decent campsite in a small clearing surrounded by pine trees, with a 
rocky outcropping providing some shelter from the wind. Kessa sets about 
gathering firewood while you clear the ground and set up your bedrolls.
"I'll take first watch," Kessa offers as she arranges stones for a fire pit. "You've 
been looking tense all day - that pull from your patron keeping you on edge?"
She's right. The constant directional tug is exhausting in a way that's hard to 
explain.
Soon you have a small fire crackling, and Kessa heats up some of your rations 
while you both settle in. The comet is clearly visible overhead now that night 
has fallen, its crimson glow brighter than you've ever seen it.
"Two more days to the mountain," Kessa says quietly, staring up at it. "Then 
we find out what fresh hell awaits us inside." She grins at her own dark humor. 
"Get some sleep, Johannes. I'll wake you for second watch."
 
The night passes uneventfully. This far from Firestorm Peak, the wildlife 
is still normal, the weather stable. You both get adequate rest.
LONG REST COMPLETED
*	HP fully restored
*	Spell slots recovered
*	Kessa's Bardic Inspiration recharged
*	Your Dark One's Own Luck recharged
 
DAY 2 OF TRAVEL
You wake to Kessa already packing up camp, humming softly. "Morning, 
sunshine. Got some cold rations ready, and the trail ahead looks clear."
The comet is still faintly visible in the dawn sky, and you can feel that pull 
even stronger now as you get closer to your destination.
The second day of travel begins. Same approach - normal pace?
Let's speed up; if we can make it to the Gates with enough light tomorrow, we 
can avoid camping in the open.
Nov 30
Smart tactical thinking - push through and commit to entering rather than 
camping outside where the Duergar might ambush you.
 
"Let's pick up the pace," you say, shouldering your pack. "If we can reach the 
gates tomorrow with daylight to spare, we avoid spending a night in the open 
near the mountain."
Kessa nods approvingly. "Good call. Elekgong's warning about the Duergar 
night raids wasn't exactly comforting. Plus, the sooner we get inside, the 
sooner we can start looking for whatever your 'friend' wants."
DAY 2 - FAST PACE
You push hard throughout the day, taking shorter breaks and maintaining a 
brisk pace even as the terrain gets rockier and steeper. The trail becomes more 
demanding - loose scree, narrow switchbacks, and increasingly sparse 
vegetation.
By mid-afternoon, you notice the temperature starting to fluctuate oddly. One 
moment you're sweating from exertion in muggy heat, the next a cold wind 
cuts through your clothes. The air feels... wrong. Charged.
"We're getting close to the influence zone," Kessa mutters, rubbing her arms 
as goosebumps rise on her skin. "Still a day out and I can already feel it."
Give me a Constitution saving throw for both of you - the forced 
march and strange atmospheric conditions are taxing.
Johannes: Roll 1d20+3 (CON save) I'll roll for Kessa:
Rolling Kessa's CON save for forced march
Go ahead and roll your CON save (1d20+3, DC 12)!
Let's do all rolls online unless I post a roll.
Nov 30
Perfect! That'll keep things moving smoothly. I'll handle all the dice rolling 
unless you specifically want to roll something yourself.
Rolling Johannes's CON save for forced march
 
Both you and Kessa handle the grueling pace well. Your soldier's conditioning 
serves you well, and Kessa's surprising stamina (probably from years of 
running from angry marks) keeps her moving strong.
By the time you make camp that evening, you've covered nearly two full days' 
worth of normal travel. Firestorm Peak looms much closer now - you can 
actually see it in the distance, a dark mountain silhouetted against the crimson 
comet.
CAMP - END OF DAY 2
"Good call on the forced march," Kessa says, stretching her legs by the fire. 
"We should reach the gates by mid-morning tomorrow, maybe earlier. Get in 
while it's still light, find somewhere defensible inside to make camp."
She's organizing her equipment, making sure her thieves' tools are accessible, 
her rapier loose in its sheath. "You feeling it stronger now?"
The pull from your patron is almost painful now - a constant, insistent 
pressure drawing you toward that mountain.
As you prepare for sleep, you notice something odd: the wildlife sounds have 
completely stopped. No birds, no insects, nothing. Just an eerie silence broken 
only by the crackling of your fire.
Kessa notices too. "Yeah. That's not ominous at all," she mutters.
The night passes tensely but without incident. You're still far 
enough from the peak that the truly maddened animals haven't 
reached you.
LONG REST COMPLETED - All resources refreshed
 
DAY 3 - FINAL APPROACH
You wake before dawn. The air crackles with barely contained energy, and 
dark clouds are gathering around Firestorm Peak despite the clear sky 
everywhere else. Thunder rumbles in the distance.
"Here we go," Kessa says quietly, staring at the mountain.
How do you want to approach the final leg? Fast and direct, or 
cautious and careful?
Cautious, we're close enough that the rush yesterday is paying off with more 
time here...
Nov 30
Rolling Perception checks for cautious approach
 
DAY 3 - CAUTIOUS APPROACH TO FIRESTORM PEAK
"Let's take it slow," you say, breaking camp methodically. "Yesterday's pace 
bought us time. Let's use it."
Kessa nods, checking her hand crossbow. "Agreed. No point rushing into 
whatever's waiting up there."
You move carefully up the increasingly barren mountainside. The vegetation 
has given way almost entirely to rock and scree. The temperature swings 
wildly - one moment oppressively hot and humid, the next bitterly cold. Your 
hair stands on end constantly, and the air tastes of copper and ozone.
Your keen perception (18) notices several important things:
About an hour into your climb, you spot movement in the sky - a flock of 
ravens circling unusually, their flight pattern erratic and aggressive. You signal 
Kessa to take cover behind a boulder, and you both wait. The birds pass 
overhead, and you catch glimpses of their eyes - milky white, almost glazed. 
Definitely not right.
"Maddened," Kessa whispers. "Like Elekgong said."
You also notice tracks in the softer soil between rocks - something humanoid 
but smaller, wearing boots. Multiple sets, maybe a day or two old, heading 
down the mountain. The bootprints are deep and evenly spaced, suggesting 
heavily laden travelers moving with military discipline.
"Duergar patrol," you murmur, examining them. "They were carrying 
something heavy. Ore, maybe - that nephelium the old man mentioned."
Around midday, the peak itself comes into full view. The mountain has an 
unnatural symmetry to it, and you can see why it's called Firestorm Peak - the 
rock formations near the summit look almost like frozen flames. About two-
thirds of the way up, you can make out a massive pair of gates set into the 
mountainside, catching the light.
Crystal. Transparent. And unmistakably open.
Thunder crashes overhead despite the cloudless sky elsewhere. A sudden 
downpour lashes at you for thirty seconds, then stops as abruptly as it began, 
leaving you both soaked and disoriented.
"This place is fighting us," Kessa mutters, wringing out her hair.
As you get closer, within perhaps a quarter mile of the gates, you hear it - a 
high-pitched chittering sound, followed by rustling in the rocks ahead.
Roll for Initiative - something is about to attack!
Roll please

Rolling initiative for combat encounter
 
COMBAT - ROUND 1
Two massive scorpions skitter out from behind boulders, each the size of a 
horse! Their exoskeletons gleam wetly, and their compound eyes have that

the first catches it in the thorax, the second slams into its head. The force of 
the impact sends the massive creature skittering backward 20 feet, chittering 
in pain and confusion.
Scorpion 1: Damaged (14 damage), pushed back 40 feet total from

smoke erupts around you as you teleport 30 feet away, collapsing to one knee 
as you reappear.
You raise a trembling hand and fire off two more eldritch blasts, but the 
venom and exhaustion take their toll - both beams go wide, sizzling harmlessly 
against the rocks.
Johannes: OUT OF SPELL SLOTS!

KESSA'S THUNDERWAVE!
A deafening boom of thunder erupts from Kessa's outstretched hands! The 
shockwave slams into both scorpions, cracking their carapaces and sending 
them skittering backward 10 feet!
Both creatures are looking badly hurt now, their movements sluggish and 
erratic.
Scorpion 1: 32 damage total - critically wounded Scorpion 2: 28 
damage total - badly wounded

JOHANNES'S TURN:
Drawing on the last reserves of your strength, you steady your aim and fire. 
The first blast punches through the scorpion's already-cracked carapace, 
making it stagger. The second beam strikes it squarely in the head with a 
sickening crack.
The massive creature convulses once, then collapses, legs curling inward as it 
dies.
SCORPION 1 DESTROYED!
As the creature falls, you feel a familiar dark surge. Your patron's blessing

What do you do?
Finish it

ROUND 7 - JOHANNES'S TURN
You open your eyes, gasping. The scorpion looms above you, dying but 
dangerous. End this!
Both beams at Scorpion 2?
Quick question, does rolling significantly but into token usage?
Nov 30
Good question! Rolling dice does use some tokens, but it's pretty minimal - 
maybe 200-400 tokens per combat round depending on complexity. The 
narrative text and game state tracking uses far more.
If you'd like, I can streamline the rolls to be more compact (just show results 
without the detailed breakdown), or we can keep the current format since we 
have plenty of tokens left (89,230 remaining out of 190,000).
What's your preference? And yes - finish off that scorpion with both beams?
No, the descriptions are most of the fun, just wanted to check.
Nov 30
Absolutely! The detailed descriptions are what makes it exciting. We're doing 
fine on tokens - plenty of room left. Let's finish this scorpion!
Rolling final Eldritch Blast to finish the last scorpion
 
JOHANNES - THE KILLING BLOW
You push yourself up on one elbow, blood streaming from multiple wounds. 
Your hand trembles as you raise it one more time.
The first blast is perfect - a critical strike that punches straight through the 
scorpion's head with a thunderous CRACK! The creature staggers, already 
dying.
The second beam slams into its thorax, and the massive beast explodes in a 
shower of chitin and ichor, its body blasted backward by the force.
As the scorpion's corpse hits the ground, that familiar dark surge flows 
through you again. The fiendish energy wraps around your broken body like a 
cold embrace, not healing but sustaining.
COMBAT COMPLETE!
 
AFTERMATH
Kessa runs over to you, helping you sit up against a boulder. "By all the gods, 
Johannes... I thought we were done for. Twice!"
You're both battered, breathing hard, covered in scorpion gore. The air still 
crackles with unnatural energy, and the crystal gates of Firestorm Peak gleam 
in the distance, maybe a quarter mile up the slope.
"We haven't even gotten inside yet," Kessa says, following your gaze. She pulls 
out a waterskin and takes a long drink before offering it to you. "At this rate, 
we'll be dead before we find whatever your patron wants."
CURRENT STATUS:
*	Johannes: 7/53 HP + 9 temp HP, 0/2 spell slots
*	Kessa: 32/40 HP, 2/4 first-level spell slots remaining
What do you want to do?
*	Take a short rest here to recover (you'll regain spell slots, Kessa can use 
Song of Rest)
*	Push on to the gates immediately
*	Search the scorpion corpses
*	Something else?
Search the corpses, then push for the entrance. No sense trying to rest out in 
the open.
Nov 30
Smart - no point resting where more maddened creatures or Duergar patrols 
could find you.
 
SEARCHING THE SCORPION CORPSES
You and Kessa approach the destroyed scorpions carefully. The first one you 
blasted is mostly intact despite the force damage. The second is... messier.
Rolling Investigation/Perception to search the scorpions
 
Your trained eye picks out several useful items. Working together, you 
carefully extract two intact venom sacs - the poison that nearly killed you 
could be useful later, either as a weapon coating or potentially traded.
"These chitin plates are incredibly hard," Kessa observes, tapping one with her 
dagger. "Not quite as strong as the nephelium Elekgong mentioned, but close. 
Could reinforce armor if we had time."
Then you notice something in the second scorpion's maw - the one you 
obliterated. Reaching carefully past the mandibles, you pull out a small object 
crusted with dried gore.
It's a ring. Silver, with strange runes etched around the band.
"Well, well," Kessa murmurs, cleaning it off with a cloth. "Looks like these 
scorpions have been snacking on previous adventurers. This could be from 
Nigel's group - twenty-seven years is long enough for bones to be digested, but 
not silver."
She hands it to you. The runes are in a script you recognize as Elvish, though 
you can't read them. There's a faint magical aura to it.
ITEMS ACQUIRED:
*	2 doses of Giant Scorpion Venom (can coat weapon, DC 12 CON save or 
4d10 poison, half on save)
*	Quality Chitin Plates (could be used by an armorer)
*	Silver Ring with Elvish Runes (magical, unidentified)
"We can figure out what the ring does once we're somewhere safe," Kessa says, 
glancing up at the gates. "Come on. Let's get inside before something else 
decides to attack."
 
APPROACHING THE GATES
You climb the final quarter mile. The weather becomes increasingly violent - 
sudden gusts of wind, a brief hailstorm, then oppressive heat. Your hair stands 
completely on end now, and the air tastes metallic.
The gates of Firestorm Peak loom before you.
They're magnificent and terrible. Two massive doors, each easily twenty feet 
tall and ten feet wide, made of perfectly transparent crystal. You can see 
straight through them into an entrance corridor beyond. The crystal has an 
almost liquid quality to it, catching and bending light in unnatural ways.
The gates stand wide open, as Elekgong said they would. Around their frame, 
you can see intricate Elvish runes carved into the mountain itself, pulsing with 
a faint blue light.
Through the crystal, you can see the corridor extends about 120 feet before 
opening into what looks like a larger chamber.
Kessa stands beside you, staring. "The Elder Elves built this. Gods know what 
they were trying to contain... or summon."
You feel your patron's pull intensify dramatically. Whatever it wants is 
definitely inside.
What do you do?
*	Enter immediately
*	Examine the gates/runes more closely first
*	Take any precautions before entering
*	Something else?
In out current state, finding someplace safe to rest is priority #2. Let's do a 
wick arcana check in the runs, then get inside.
Nov 30
Rolling Arcana check to examine the gate runes
 
EXAMINING THE RUNES
You move closer to study the elaborate runes carved around the gate frame. 
Your arcane training helps you parse some of the meaning, though the full 
complexity is beyond you in your current exhausted state.
What you discern:
The runes are a Ritual of Closing - extremely powerful magic designed to 
seal the gates. The inscription roughly translates to: "By star's return, the seal 
breaks. By star's departure, the seal holds. Let no mortal hand undo what 
Elder wisdom wrought."
The runes are specifically keyed to the Dragon's Tear comet. When the comet 
appears in the sky, the gates open. When it vanishes, the gates close and 
become impenetrable. The magic is so potent that nothing you know of could 
force them open or closed outside of the comet's cycle.
You also notice something troubling - faint scorch marks and scratch marks 
around the inner edges of the gate frame, as if something has been trying to 
claw its way out from the inside.
"So we have about 27 days before these gates seal with us inside," Kessa says 
grimly, reading over your shoulder. "No pressure."
She touches the crystal cautiously. "It's warm. Shouldn't crystal be cool to the 
touch?"
You notice she's right - the gates radiate a faint warmth, and there's the 
slightest vibration, like they're humming at a frequency just below hearing.
"Let's get inside and find somewhere to barricade ourselves," you say. Your 
wounds are really starting to hurt now that the adrenaline is wearing off.
 
ENTERING FIRESTORM PEAK
You step through the crystal gates.
The moment you cross the threshold, the oppressive atmospheric pressure 
lessens slightly. The constant hair-raising static reduces, though doesn't 
disappear entirely. The corridor ahead is carved from solid stone, clearly 
worked by skilled hands - the walls are smooth, the ceiling a perfect arch.
The corridor extends 120 feet ahead, dimly lit by a faint phosphorescent glow 
from the stone itself. At the far end, you can see it opens into a larger chamber.
The air inside is stale but breathable, with an odd metallic tang.
"Well," Kessa whispers, hand on her rapier, "we're in. Now let's hope we can 
find a defensible room before something finds us."
You advance down the entry corridor. As you near the end, what do 
you see?
Searched project for "entry corridor room 2a first chamber gates firestorm 
peak"
1 result
 
ROOM 2A - THE AMBUSH ROOM
As you reach the end of the corridor, it opens into a larger chamber. The 
phosphorescent glow continues here, giving you dim visibility.
The chamber is roughly 40 feet wide and extends northward. About 20 feet 
into the room, you see a wall blocking the continuation of the corridor - clearly 
not part of the original construction. It's crude stonework, about 10 feet tall, 
with what look like sharpened spikes or barbs protruding from the top.
The room feels... wrong. Too quiet. Your patron's pull tugs you forward, but 
your soldier's instincts scream ambush.
Rolling Perception to detect the Duergar ambush
 
Kessa grabs your arm suddenly, pulling you back. "Wait," she hisses, eyes 
narrowed. "Something's not right. The air... it's moving wrong. Like there's 
breathing."
You both freeze, listening. She's right - there's an almost imperceptible sound 
of slow, controlled breathing coming from behind the wall. Multiple sources.
"Invisible," Kessa whispers. "Behind the wall. Waiting for us to try climbing 
it."
Your eyes adjust further, and you notice faint disturbances in the air - heat 
shimmer from large bodies. Four of them, you think. Massive - at least 16 feet 
tall based on the heat patterns. They're standing perfectly still, enormous 
polearms ready.
"Duergar," you murmur. "Enlarged. The bastards set up a welcoming 
committee."
Kessa nods grimly. "We're exhausted, nearly out of resources, and they're 
fresh and ready. If we try to fight through here..."
She doesn't finish the sentence. You both know the odds.
"We need a defensible place to rest before we can tackle this," she says. "But 
where? We can't go back outside - those scorpions proved that. And this is 
clearly the main route forward."
What do you do?
*	Try to fight through despite your condition (4 enlarged invisible Duergar 
with reach weapons)
*	Look for an alternative route (the adventure mentions bolt-holes and 
side passages)
*	Try to negotiate/bluff your way past
*	Use magic creatively to bypass or neutralize the ambush
*	Something else?
Alternate entry points
Nov 30
Smart - no point throwing yourselves at a prepared ambush when you're this 
beat up.
 
SEARCHING FOR ALTERNATE ROUTES
You and Kessa back carefully away from the ambush chamber, retreating to 
the entry corridor.
"There has to be another way," Kessa says quietly. "This place is huge - the 
Duergar can't have guards on every passage. Let's look for side tunnels, 
maintenance shafts, anything."
Rolling to search for alternate entry points
 
EXCELLENT SUCCESS!
Your trained military eye spots what Kessa missed - faint tool marks along the 
northern wall of the entry corridor, about 30 feet back from the ambush 
chamber. They're subtle, almost invisible in the dim phosphorescent light, but 
they're there.
Running your hands along the stone, you find it - a seam. A concealed door, 
cleverly fitted to blend with the natural rock.
"Kessa, here," you whisper.
She pulls out her thieves' tools and examines the mechanism. "No lock, just a 
hidden catch. Probably a bolt-hole the Duergar use to access their barracks 
without going through the main chamber."
With a soft click, the door swings inward, revealing a narrow tunnel - only 
about 4 feet tall and 3 feet wide. Perfect for Duergar-sized creatures, cramped 
for you.
"We'll have to crouch-walk," Kessa says, peering into the darkness. "But it 
leads somewhere. I can feel air movement."
The tunnel is unlit, carved from raw stone. It heads roughly northeast, curving 
out of sight.
Do you:
*	Enter the bolt-hole tunnel (will need light source or darkvision)
*	Continue searching for other options
*	Reconsider the frontal approach
Note: If you enter, what's your light situation?
*	Kessa can cast Dancing Lights or use a torch
*	You could use a torch
*	Risk moving in darkness (Kessa has no darkvision, you don't either as 
human)
Devil's sight?
Nov 30
Ah, excellent point! Let me check your Devil's Sight invocation.
Devil's Sight: You can see normally in darkness (magical and nonmagical) to 
120 feet.
So YOU can see perfectly in the darkness! However, Kessa doesn't have 
darkvision - she's half-elf, which gives her darkvision 60 feet in dim light, but 
this tunnel is pitch black.
Options:
1.	You lead, Kessa follows closely - You can see and guide her 
verbally, she keeps a hand on your shoulder. Stealthy but slower.
2.	Kessa uses Dancing Lights cantrip - Gives light for both of you, but 
risks alerting enemies. The lights can be positioned ahead to scout.
3.	Kessa uses a torch - Simple solution, but definitely gives away your 
position.
4.	You use Mage Hand to carry a torch ahead - Clever! Light source 
is 30 feet ahead of you, you can see with Devil's Sight, Kessa can see by 
torchlight.
What's your preference?
Keep it dark. I lead, Kessa follows
Nov 30
Rolling Stealth for moving through the dark tunnel
 
MOVING THROUGH THE BOLT-HOLE
"Stay dark," you whisper. "I can see. Keep your hand on my shoulder and 
follow exactly where I step."
Kessa nods, trusting you, and places her hand on your shoulder blade.
You enter the cramped tunnel, hunched over, your Devil's Sight cutting 
through the absolute darkness like it's noon. The tunnel is rough-hewn, tool 
marks visible on the walls - Duergar work, functional but crude.
About 20 feet in, disaster strikes. In your exhausted, wounded state, you 
misjudge a step. Your boot scrapes loudly against loose stone, and you stumble 
slightly. The sound echoes down the tunnel.
Behind you, Kessa - moving blind despite her best efforts - bumps into you, 
and her crossbow clatters against the stone wall.
CLANK
You both freeze, hearts pounding.
Silence. Then, from somewhere ahead in the darkness, you hear it - a grunt of 
surprise, then rapid Dwarvish speech. Harsh, guttural syllables you don't 
understand, but the tone is clear: alert.
Your Devil's Sight shows you the tunnel ahead continues another 30 feet 
before branching. But now you can see movement - shadows shifting in a 
chamber beyond.
"They heard us," Kessa whispers, her hand tightening on your shoulder. "How 
many?"
Peering ahead, you see the tunnel opens into what looks like a small barracks 
room. Through the opening, you can make out bunks, equipment... and at 
least two Duergar scrambling for weapons.
What do you do?
*	Rush forward and attack before they're fully ready
*	Retreat back to the entry corridor
*	Hold position and prepare to defend the narrow tunnel (tactical 
advantage - they can only come at you one at a time)
*	Try to bluff in Common that you're lost explorers
*	Something else?
Current Status:
*	Johannes: 7/53 HP + 9 temp HP, 0/2 spell slots
*	Kessa: 32/40 HP, 2/4 first-level spell slots

Nov 30
Rolling Eldritch Blast in the tunnel chokepoint
And have Kressa ready dancing light as a surprise when the dwarves approach
Nov 30
Excellent tactical thinking! Blind them right when they enter the tunnel.
 
JOHANNES & KESSA - DEFENSIVE POSITION
"Hold here," you growl, bracing yourself in the narrow tunnel. Your first 
eldritch blast goes wild in the cramped space, crackling against the stone wall. 
The second streaks true, slamming into the first Duergar and blasting him 
backward into the barracks room.
He staggers but stays on his feet, blood streaming from his chest. Both gray 
dwarves are now grabbing weapons - picks and hammers.
"Kessa, ready Dancing Lights," you whisper. "Wait until they're right on us, 
then blind them."
"Got it," she murmurs, her fingers already weaving the cantrip's pattern, 
holding the magic ready to release.
The wounded Duergar snarls something in Dwarvish, and both of them start 
advancing toward the tunnel entrance. They're moving cautiously - they know 
the tunnel is a chokepoint that favors you.
Through your Devil's Sight, you watch them approach. They're about 15 feet 
from the tunnel entrance now... 10 feet... 5 feet...
The first Duergar steps into the tunnel opening, his eyes struggling in the pitch 
darkness.
"NOW!" you shout.
Kessa's Dancing Lights surprise and rolling initiative
 
COMBAT - ROUND 1
Four brilliant orbs of light suddenly blaze into existence right in the Duergar's 
faces! They cry out, recoiling, hands thrown up to shield their eyes. Both are 
completely blinded by the sudden illumination!

1.	Kessa (17) ? UP
2.	Duergar 2 (17) - BLINDED
3.	Johannes (15)
4.	Duergar 1 (4) - BLINDED, wounded (6 damage)
KESSA'S TURN:
She's already got her hand crossbow up. "One shot, make it count," she 
mutters, aiming at the wounded Duergar staggering in the tunnel entrance!
Rolling Kessa's attack with advantage
 
KESSA - PERFECT SHOT!
THUNK!
Kessa's bolt takes the wounded, blinded Duergar right through the throat. He 
gurgles once, drops his pick, and collapses in the tunnel entrance!
"One down!" she shouts, already reloading.
 
DUERGAR 2'S TURN:
The second gray dwarf, still blinded and disoriented, stumbles forward over 
his companion's body into the tunnel. He swings his warhammer blindly!
Rolling blinded Duergar's attack
The Duergar swings wildly, the warhammer clanging off the stone walls with a 
shower of sparks! He can't see a damn thing!
 
JOHANNES'S TURN
One down, one blinded and helpless. Finish him!
Rolling Eldritch Blast with advantage
 
JOHANNES - EXECUTION
Both of your eldritch blasts strike true! The first catches the blinded Duergar 
in the chest, spinning him around. The second slams into his back, blasting 
him forward. He crashes face-first into the tunnel wall and slides down, dead.
COMBAT COMPLETE - VICTORY!
Kessa's dancing lights fade, leaving you both in darkness again - though your 
Devil's Sight shows the aftermath clearly. Two dead Duergar in the cramped 
tunnel, their blood pooling on the stone.
"Nice work," Kessa breathes, still tense. "But that wasn't quiet. If there are 
more in the barracks ahead..."
She's right. You listen carefully. Silence from the chamber beyond, but that 
doesn't mean it's empty.
What do you do?
*	Advance cautiously into the barracks room (might be more Duergar, 
might be empty)
*	Search the two dead Duergar quickly
*	Retreat and try to find yet another route
*	Push forward to find a room to barricade and rest
Remember: You're at 7/53 HP + 9 temp, Kessa at 32/40 HP, and 
you desperately need to rest
Search the dwarves then look for a hiding spot
Nov 30
Rolling loot from the dead Duergar
 
SEARCHING THE BODIES
Working quickly, you strip the Duergar of valuables - 39 silver pieces, 19 gold, 
and 3 small rough-cut gems. The weapons are serviceable but nothing special. 
Their armor is too small for either of you, though Kessa pockets one of the 
picks.
"Might be useful for prying open doors," she mutters.
You take a swig from one of their waterskins - it's weak ale with a bitter fungal 
aftertaste, but it's wet. You offer it to Kessa, who grimaces but drinks.
 
SEARCHING FOR A HIDING SPOT
You advance cautiously into the barracks room beyond. Your Devil's Sight 
reveals:
Examining the barracks for hiding spots
 
THE BARRACKS ROOM
The chamber is a typical Duergar sleeping quarters - functional, cramped, 
smelling of stone dust and stale sweat. Ten small cots line the walls, 
footlockers scattered about containing little of value.
Most importantly, it's currently empty except for the two you just killed.
As you examine the northern wall, you find another secret door - these gray 
dwarves have escape routes everywhere.
"Smart," Kessa murmurs, tracing the hidden seam. "Multiple exits. We could 
use this if we get cornered."
You drag the two Duergar bodies into the room and push some cots against 
the northern door as a makeshift barricade. It won't stop a determined assault, 
but it'll give you warning.
Kessa eyes the small cots dubiously. "We're not going to fit on these."
"Floor it is," you say, already feeling the exhaustion pulling at you. "We need a 
short rest minimum. Get our spell slots back, patch ourselves up."
"What about patrols?" she asks, though she's already sitting down heavily 
against the wall.
"We have maybe 2-4 hours before someone checks on these two. Short rest 
takes an hour. It's a risk, but we don't have a choice."
Do you want to:
*	Take a short rest here (1 hour, regain spell slots, use Hit Dice to heal)
*	Push on through the secret passage first to find somewhere deeper/safer
*	Set watches and rest in shifts
If you rest, how do you want to heal?
*	You have Hit Dice (1d8 + CON mod each, you have 6 available)
*	Kessa can use Song of Rest for an extra d6
*	Kessa could use spell slots to heal with Cure Wounds
Push forward first and our some distance between us and the bodies before 
sleeping
Nov 30
Smart - don't sleep next to the crime scene. Let's move deeper before they find 
the bodies.
 
MOVING DEEPER INTO THE COMPLEX
"Good call," Kessa says, pushing herself to her feet with a grimace. "Let's put 
some distance between us and these bodies. When they find them, I don't 
want to be in the adjacent room."
You open the secret door in the northern wall. Another narrow passage, 
similar to the bolt-hole but curving east. Your Devil's Sight pierces the 
darkness ahead.
"Same as before," you tell Kessa. "Hand on my shoulder, stay quiet."
Rolling stealth and exploration
 
EXCELLENT DISCOVERY!
Moving with extreme care, you navigate the winding passages. Your earlier 
clumsiness forgotten, you guide Kessa perfectly through the darkness. She 
follows with practiced silence, trusting your directions completely.
After about ten minutes of careful movement, you spot something - a small 
side chamber, easily missed. It's set back from the main passage behind a 
natural rock formation that creates a blind corner.
Inside, your Devil's Sight reveals:
A HIDDEN STORAGE ROOM
*	Size: 15 ft x 15 ft, 8 ft ceiling
*	Contents: Old mining equipment, broken picks, empty crates
*	Entrances: Single narrow opening (easily watched/barricaded)
*	Condition: Dusty, clearly unused for months or years
*	Defensibility: EXCELLENT - off the main routes, easy to miss, single 
chokepoint
"This is perfect," you whisper to Kessa as you guide her inside. "Storage room, 
forgotten, off the beaten path."
She pulls out a small candle from her pack and lights it, keeping it shielded. 
The flickering light reveals the dusty chamber.
"How'd you find this?" she asks, impressed.
"Military training. Always look for the overlooked spaces." You're already 
dragging an old crate across the entrance. "We can stack these to block the 
opening, leave a gap we can watch through."
Together, you create a makeshift barricade - not impenetrable, but enough to 
give warning and force attackers into a fatal funnel.
Kessa slumps against the back wall, finally letting her guard down. 
"Okay. Now we rest. Gods, I'm exhausted."
You're swaying on your feet, the adrenaline finally wearing off. Your wounds 
throb, your head pounds, and you can barely keep your eyes open.
 
SHORT REST
You have 1 hour to recover in relative safety.

You wake from a light, troubled sleep. Kessa kept first watch, now she's gently 
shaking your shoulder.
"Your turn," she whispers. "Nothing's come by. I think we're safe for now."
You sit up, wincing. Your wounds have closed somewhat - magical healing and 
natural recovery working together. You're still battered (27/53 HP), but you're 
functional again. More importantly, you can feel your connection to your 
patron restored, your spell slots recharged.
Kessa looks much better - fully healed and alert, though still weary. She settles 
down to sleep while you take the second watch.
The hour passes quietly. No sounds of alarm, no patrols. Through the small 
gap in your barricade, you watch the dark passage with your Devil's Sight, but 
nothing moves.
When Kessa wakes, you both sit in the dimness, sharing some rations and 
water.
"So," she says quietly, "we're deeper in the complex now. We've bypassed that 
main ambush point. What's the plan? Your... patron. What's it telling you?"
You focus inward on that ever-present pull. It's stronger than ever, a insistent 
tug pointing... northeast, you think. Deeper into the mountain, toward the 
inner chambers.
"It wants us to go deeper," you say. "Toward the heart of this place."
Kessa nods. "The Inner Sanctum. Where the Elder Elves opened their Gate to 
the Far Realm." She shivers. "Whatever your fiend wants, it's in there. 
Question is - how do we get there without fighting through the entire Duergar 
garrison?"
What's your approach?
*	Try to sneak through the complex using these back passages
*	Scout ahead to map out Duergar positions
*	Look for intelligence - maps, documents that show the layout
*	Push forward boldly and fight when necessary
*	Something else?
Current Status:
*	Johannes: 27/53 HP, 2/2 spell slots, 3/6 HD remaining
*	Kessa: 40/40 HP, 2/4 spell slots, 5/6 HD remaining
*	You're well-rested and ready to continue
Search for intelligence
Nov 30
Rolling Investigation/Perception to search for intel
 
SEARCHING FOR INTELLIGENCE - EXCELLENT SUCCESS!
"Good idea," you murmur. "Before we go blundering around, let's see what we 
can learn."
You methodically search the storage room while Kessa keeps watch. Most of it 
is junk - broken mining tools, empty crates, discarded equipment. But your 
military training serves you well - you know soldiers and workers often hide 
things in storage areas.
Behind a stack of rotting crates, you find it.
A leather satchel, forgotten or deliberately hidden. Inside:
1. A Crude Map
Drawn on a piece of scraped hide in charcoal and what looks like dried blood. 
It shows the Duergar complex - the "Outer Complex" as it's labeled in rough 
Dwarvish script (which you can partially read due to its similarity to 
Common).
Searched project for "Wellfast Duergar leader map outer complex layout"
1 result
 
CRITICAL INTELLIGENCE FOUND!
You pull out the map and study it carefully. Kessa lights her candle to see.
"By the gods," she breathes, looking over your shoulder. "This is a map of the 
whole Duergar complex."
The map is crude but detailed enough to be useful. You can make out:
WELLFAST'S MAP - Key Intelligence:
1.	Red Garrison Markers - Show major Duergar strongpoints:
*	The ambush room (Room 2a) you avoided - 4 enlarged Duergar
*	Multiple checkpoints with 4-6 guards each
*	A "Grand Promenade" (Room 31) - major bazaar with steeder-
riders on patrol
*	Guard barracks scattered throughout
2.	Route to Inner Chambers - Labeled "The Twisted Caverns"
*	The map shows a path through the Duergar complex leading to 
caves
*	These caves connect to the "Inner Sanctum" where your patron 
pulls you
3.	Key Locations Marked:
*	Room 41: Labeled "Wellfast's Quarters" - This is their 
commander
*	Slave Pens (Room 23) - Goblins kept as workers
*	The Gauntlet (Room 3) - Trapped corridor with pit traps
*	Checkpoints (Rooms 17, 24) - Alert points that warn Wellfast
2. A Scrawled Note
Written in Common, in a shaky hand:
"Wellfast has one of the crystal components. Sapphire rod in his quarters. 
The deepspawn in the caverns guards the emerald. Madreus keeps the third. 
All three needed to refocus the Vast Gate. -N"
The initial "N" - could this be from Nigel, one of the lost adventurers?
3. A Warning
Another scrap:
"Beware gibberlings in the Twisted Caverns. Hundreds. Also - Wellfast 
controls them somehow. Unnatural."
 
Kessa studies the map intently. "This is incredible intel. Look - if we can avoid 
the checkpoints and the Grand Promenade, we might be able to sneak through 
the residential areas and reach the Twisted Caverns without fighting the whole 
garrison."
She traces a finger along the map. "But Johannes... this note about crystal 
components. Does your patron want one of those?"
You focus on the pull. It's definitely drawing you toward the Inner Sanctum, 
past the Twisted Caverns.
What do you make of this intelligence? And what's your plan 
forward?
Is there a safe way to approach Wellfasts quests without stumbling into a 
patrol?
Nov 30
Analyzing the map for routes to Wellfast's quarters
 
TACTICAL ANALYSIS - EXCELLENT SUCCESS!
You study the map with your soldier's eye, tracing patrol routes, garrison 
positions, and traffic patterns. After several minutes, you tap the hide map.
"There's a way," you say quietly. "It's not safe exactly, but it avoids the major 
strongpoints."
You point out the route to Kessa:
THE STEALTH ROUTE TO WELLFAST'S QUARTERS:
"Look - we're here, in the barracks area. Most of the garrison markers are 
concentrated in three places:
1.	The Entry Ambush (Room 2a) - which we bypassed
2.	The Checkpoints (Rooms 17, 24) - alert stations that warn Wellfast
3.	The Grand Promenade (Room 31) - the bazaar, heavily patrolled
"But Wellfast's quarters are in the residential section, accessible through side 
passages. The map shows bolt-holes and service corridors throughout - the 
Duergar use them to move without going through public areas."
You trace a path with your finger:
"If we continue through these back passages, avoiding the main 
thoroughfares, we can reach the residential quarter. The map shows Wellfast's 
suite is near the Grand Promenade, but there's a service entrance from the 
back - probably for servants or maintenance."
THE ROUTE:
*	Continue through bolt-holes and storage areas (low traffic)
*	Navigate around the slave pens (Room 23) - goblins won't raise alarm 
against non-Duergar
*	Slip through residential quarters when off-duty Duergar are sleeping or 
in the bazaar
*	Approach Wellfast's quarters from the service entrance
RISKS YOU IDENTIFY:
1.	Timing: Need to move when Duergar are either at the bazaar or 
sleeping
2.	Wellfast Himself: If he's in his quarters, he's a major threat (the note 
suggests he's powerful)
3.	Magical Wards: His quarters are likely protected with alarms or 
glyphs
4.	Escape Route: Getting out with a stolen crystal component will be 
harder than getting in
Kessa nods slowly. "So we could potentially reach his quarters without fighting 
through the garrison. But..."
She looks at you seriously. "Do we want to steal from their commander? That 
crystal component - is that what your patron wants? Or does it want 
something deeper in, past the Twisted Caverns in the Inner Sanctum?"
Good question. What does your patron actually want?
You focus inward on that fiendish pull. It's not pointing at Wellfast's quarters - 
it's pulling you past them, deeper into the mountain, toward the Twisted 
Caverns and the Inner Sanctum beyond.
"No," you say finally. "It doesn't want the crystal. It wants something deeper. 
In the Inner Sanctum itself."
"Then why risk Wellfast at all?" Kessa asks. "We could use this route to slip 
past the Duergar entirely, reach the Twisted Caverns, and head for whatever 
your patron actually wants."
DECISION POINT:
Option A: Bypass Wellfast entirely
*	Use the stealth route to reach the Twisted Caverns
*	Avoid unnecessary combat with the Duergar
*	Head straight for what your patron wants in the Inner Sanctum
*	Leave the crystal components alone (they're not your mission)
Option B: Hit Wellfast's quarters first
*	The crystal component might be valuable (could be leverage or payment 
to patron)
*	Wellfast is their commander - disrupting him could help on the way out
*	High risk - if caught, the entire garrison comes down on you
*	Might find other useful intel or equipment
What's your call?
The staff seems far too important to be left behind. V whatever is deeper is 
likely keyed to these elements. Don't want to have to back track
Nov 30
Excellent strategic thinking - if you need those crystal components to interact 
with whatever's in the Inner Sanctum, better to grab them now than have to 
fight your way back through.
 
DECISION: ACQUIRE THE CRYSTAL COMPONENTS
"You're right," you say, studying the map. "These crystal components - three of 
them needed to 'refocus the Vast Gate.' That's not a coincidence. Whatever my 
patron wants in the Inner Sanctum, it's almost certainly connected to that 
gate."
Kessa nods. "Better to have them and not need them than reach the Inner 
Sanctum and realize we're missing a key."
You trace the locations on the map:
THE THREE CRYSTAL COMPONENTS:
1.	Sapphire Rod - Wellfast's quarters (Room 41)
2.	Emerald Rod - Guarded by a "deepspawn" in the Twisted Caverns 
(Room 74)
3.	Third Component - Held by someone named "Madreus" (location 
unknown, likely Inner Sanctum)
"So we need at least two," you mutter. "Wellfast's and the deepspawn's. Maybe 
all three if we find this Madreus."
"What's a deepspawn?" Kessa asks, looking worried.
You shake your head. "Nothing good. Some kind of aberration, probably. We'll 
deal with it when we get there."
THE PLAN:
"We use the stealth route to Wellfast's quarters, acquire the sapphire 
component, then continue to the Twisted Caverns for the emerald one. With 
luck, Wellfast won't even know we were there until we're long gone."
Kessa checks her equipment. "And if he's in his quarters?"
You meet her eyes. "Then we fight. Fast and hard. Kill him before he can raise 
the alarm."
She takes a deep breath. "Alright. When do we move?"
Analyzing optimal timing for the mission
 
"Now," you say decisively. "We move now. We have maybe 1-3 hours before 
someone finds those bodies in the barracks. Once that happens, the whole 
complex goes on alert."
Kessa carefully folds the map and tucks it into her pack. "Lead the way."
You extinguish her candle, plunging the room back into darkness. Your Devil's 
Sight pierces it easily.
"Same as before - hand on my shoulder, trust me to guide you."
She nods, gripping your shoulder.
You remove the barricade carefully and slip into the passage, moving with 
purpose now. The map is burned into your memory - every turn, every 
junction.
NAVIGATION CHECK - Moving to Wellfast's Quarters:
Rolling stealth checks for infiltration
 
THE INFILTRATION - DETECTED!
The first part goes reasonably well. You navigate the twisting passages, past 
empty residential chambers. A few Duergar are in their quarters, but they 
don't notice you slipping by in the darkness.
The slave pens are easier - the goblins see you through the bars of their cages, 
but they watch silently, hope flickering in their eyes. They won't alert their 
masters.
But as you approach the area near Wellfast's quarters, disaster strikes.
You're moving down a side corridor when your boot catches on a loose stone - 
you stumble, catching yourself against the wall with a scrape of leather on 
stone.
The sound echoes.
"Who's there?" A harsh voice in Dwarvish, followed by the sound of armor and 
weapons.
Two Duergar guards round the corner ahead of you, picks in hand. They're 
maybe 30 feet away, peering into the darkness. They can't see you yet - but 
they know someone's there.
One of them starts to reach for a horn at his belt - an alarm!
CRISIS MOMENT - INITIATIVE!
Rolling initiative for surprise encounter
 
SURPRISE ROUND - STOP THE ALARM!
Both you and Kessa react instantly. The guards are surprised, still squinting 
into the darkness, one reaching for his horn.
You both act simultaneously in the surprise round. The guards 
can't act yet.
JOHANNES & KESSA - What do you do?
Options:
*	Johannes: Eldritch Blast the guard with the horn (2 beams, can split 
or focus)
*	Kessa: Can use Vicious Mockery (save or take damage + disadvantage), 
or crossbow, or a spell
Critical decision: Do you focus fire on the guard with the horn, or split 
targets to try to drop both before they can shout?
Remember:
*	If the horn sounds, Wellfast and the entire complex will be alerted
*	These are 30 feet away
*	After this surprise round, they'll act normally and can shout/blow horn

Cast hex, then eldritch blast on horn blower
Nov 30
Rolling Hex + Eldritch Blast combo on horn bearer
 
SURPRISE ROUND - PERFECT EXECUTION!
You react with lethal precision. Your hand shoots out, weaving the hex curse 
as dark energy wraps around the guard reaching for his horn. Then, without 
pausing, twin eldritch blasts erupt from your palm.
The first beam strikes him in the chest - 12 points of pure force combined with 
4 points of withering necrotic energy. He staggers backward with a grunt of 
pain.
The second beam catches him before he can recover - another wave of force 
and corruption that literally tears through his torso. He's blasted backward 20 
feet, dead before he hits the ground. The horn tumbles from his lifeless 
fingers, clattering on the stone.
Kessa's crossbow twangs and her bolt catches the second guard in the 
shoulder - 4 points of damage. He cries out in pain and surprise.
ALARM PREVENTED! The horn never sounded!
 
ROUND 1 - INITIATIVE
Setting up Round 1
 
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN
One guard obliterated, one wounded and terrified. The second guard saw his 
companion literally disintegrated by your dark magic - he's clearly 
outmatched.
What do you do?
Options:
*	Finish him with Eldritch Blast (he still has Hex on him... wait, no - Hex 
is on Guard 1 who's dead. You'd need to use bonus action to move it to 
Guard 2)
*	Move Hex to Guard 2 (bonus action) then Eldritch Blast
*	Try to intimidate him into silence/surrender
*	Rush him for melee to silence him before he can shout
*	Something else
The guard is wounded, frightened, 30 feet away, and about to either fight or 
flee/shout for help.
What's your move?
Hex, then EB on guard 2
Nov 30
Moving Hex and casting Eldritch Blast on Guard 2
 
COMBAT COMPLETE - FLAWLESS EXECUTION
The dark curse shifts from the dead guard to the living one like a shadow 
changing hosts. The surviving Duergar's eyes widen in terror as he feels the 
hex settle over him.
He opens his mouth - whether to scream or beg, you'll never know.
Your first eldritch blast is a critical hit - 18 points of combined force and 
necrotic energy that punches clean through his chest. He staggers, already 
dying.
The second beam catches him as he falls - 11 more points of damage that 
ensures he's dead before he hits the ground.
Both bodies lie still in the corridor. No alarm. No shouts. Clean and silent.
 
AFTERMATH
Kessa hurries forward, checking the bodies quickly. "Dead. Both of them." She 
retrieves her crossbow bolt and looks at you with newfound respect. "That hex 
combination... that was brutal. Effective, but brutal."
You're breathing hard, adrenaline pumping. The dark energy of your patron 
thrums through you - you can feel its approval at the violence.
"We need to hide these bodies," Kessa says urgently, "and quickly. We're right 
outside Wellfast's area."
She's right. According to the map, you're very close to his quarters now. The 
service entrance should be just ahead.
CURRENT STATUS:
*	Johannes: 27/53 HP, 1/2 spell slots, Hex active (concentration, 1 hour 
duration)
*	Kessa: 40/40 HP, 2/4 spell slots
*	Two dead Duergar guards in the corridor
*	No alarm raised (yet)
*	Very close to Wellfast's quarters
What do you do?
*	Drag bodies into a side room/alcove quickly
*	Leave them - push forward to Wellfast's quarters immediately
*	Search the bodies first
*	Scout ahead before moving the bodies
Time is of the essence - every minute increases the chance someone finds 
either these bodies or the ones you left in the barracks earlier.
Hide and search bodies, ensure stealth holds
Nov 30
Searching and hiding the guard bodies
 
BODIES CONCEALED - PERFECT EXECUTION
Working quickly and efficiently, you strip the guards of their coin - 32 silver, 
10 gold, not much but every bit helps. You leave the picks and horn.
Your eye catches something just down the corridor - a maintenance alcove, 
partially concealed behind a faded tapestry showing ancient Duergar warriors 
crushing surface elves. Perfect.
"There," you whisper to Kessa, pointing.
Together you drag the bodies into the alcove. Your military training shows - 
you move them silently, efficiently, arranging them in the shadows where they 
won't be immediately visible. Unless someone specifically searches this alcove 
or notices the blood trail (which Kessa quickly scuffs over with her boot), the 
bodies won't be found for hours, maybe days.
"Good work," Kessa murmurs, smoothing the tapestry back into place. "Now 
let's move before our luck runs out."
 
APPROACHING WELLFAST'S QUARTERS
You continue down the corridor, your Devil's Sight guiding you through the 
darkness. According to the map, Wellfast's quarters should be just ahead - the 
service entrance on the east side.
After another minute of careful movement, you find it: a nondescript door, 
ironbound and solid. Unlike the main entrance (which the map shows is 
grander and likely trapped/warded), this looks like a servant's entrance.
Examining Wellfast's service entrance
 
AT THE SERVICE ENTRANCE
You examine the door carefully. There's something about it - a faint tingle of 
magic that makes the hair on your arms stand up, but you can't quite pin down 
what kind of ward it might be. Could be an alarm, could be nothing.
Kessa examines the lock and the door frame, running her fingers along the 
edges. "No traps I can see," she whispers. "Standard lock - I can pick it in 
under a minute."
You press your ear to the door. Thick wood muffles sound, but you hear... 
nothing. Either the room is empty, or whoever's inside is very quiet. Or 
sleeping.
Kessa looks at you. "Call it, Johannes. Do we go in?"
DECISION POINT:
What's your approach?
1.	Pick the lock and enter quietly
*	Risk: If someone's inside and awake, you're caught
*	Risk: Unknown magical ward might trigger
*	Benefit: If empty, you get the component cleanly
2.	Knock/announce yourself (bluff as servants/guards)
*	Risk: If Wellfast is inside, he'll know something's wrong
*	Benefit: Could determine if occupied before entering
3.	Try to disable/bypass the magical ward first
*	Requires: Arcana check or Dispel Magic (you don't have it)
*	Risk: Might trigger the ward trying to disable it
4.	Find another entrance
*	The main entrance (more heavily defended/warded)
*	Give up and move on to the Twisted Caverns instead
What do you do?
Arcana check
Nov 30
Rolling Arcana check to analyze the magical ward
 
ARCANA CHECK - SUCCESS!
You focus your senses on the magical energy emanating from the door. After a 
moment of concentration, the pattern becomes clear.
"It's a Glyph of Warding," you whisper to Kessa. "Alarm variant. The moment 
we open this door without the correct passphrase, it'll send a silent magical 
alert straight to Wellfast - wherever he is in the complex."
Kessa's face falls. "So if we go through this door, he knows immediately."
"Exactly."
She thinks for a moment. "Can you disable it?"
You shake your head. "Not without Dispel Magic, which I don't have. And I 
don't know the passphrase."
"So our options are..."
You consider the situation:
OPTIONS:
1.	Trigger the ward and rush the grab
*	Open door, grab the sapphire component, get out fast
*	Wellfast will be alerted and come running
*	You'll have maybe 2-5 minutes before he arrives with 
reinforcements
2.	Find another way in
*	Look for a window or ventilation shaft
*	Try to break through a wall (loud, slow)
*	Check if there's another unguarded entrance
3.	Abandon Wellfast's component
*	Skip the sapphire rod entirely
*	Head straight for the Twisted Caverns and the deepspawn's 
emerald rod
*	Hope one component is enough (or that you can get Madreus's 
third)
4.	Wait and ambush
*	Set up an ambush outside the door
*	Lure Wellfast out somehow
*	Kill him, then search his quarters at leisure
Kessa looks at you. "Your call, Johannes. But we need to decide fast. Every 
minute we stand here increases the chance someone finds those bodies."
What do you do?
Find another way...
Nov 30
Searching for alternate entry to Wellfast's quarters
 
ALTERNATE ENTRY - EXCELLENT DISCOVERY!
"Let's circle around," you whisper. "There has to be another way in."
You and Kessa move along the corridor, examining the walls and ceiling. 
You're looking for anything - ventilation shafts, adjoining rooms, structural 
weaknesses.
And then you find it.
About thirty feet down from the service entrance, there's a storage room - one 
of many scattered throughout the complex. But this one shares a wall with 
Wellfast's quarters, and when you examine that wall closely, your soldier's eye 
spots something crucial.
"Kessa, look at this."
The wall is stone, but it's newer stone than the rest - different color, different 
texture. Someone walled off what was probably once a connecting door or 
passage.
"They sealed it," Kessa says, running her fingers along the mortar. "Probably 
when Wellfast took over and made these his private quarters."
"Right. But look..." You point to a section near the floor. "The mortar here is 
crumbling. Water damage, maybe, or just age. And behind it..." You tap gently. 
The sound is hollow.
"We could break through," Kessa says, eyes lighting up. "Quietly, with those 
Duergar picks we've been collecting. Chip away the weak mortar, pull out 
enough stones to make a hole big enough to crawl through."
You nod. "And since it's not a door or window, it won't trigger any wards. 
Glyphs are tied to entrances, not random sections of wall."
"How long?" she asks.
You study the wall. "Ten, maybe fifteen minutes of careful work. Quiet work - 
just picking away mortar and shifting stones."
THE PLAN:
Use the Duergar picks to carefully dismantle the weakened section of wall, 
creating a crawl-space into Wellfast's quarters. It will bypass all magical wards 
on the doors.
RISKS:
*	10-15 minutes of work = more time for bodies to be discovered 
elsewhere
*	Making noise during the work could alert someone
*	If Wellfast IS in his quarters, he might hear you breaking through
Do you:
*	Proceed with the wall breach (Stealth checks required)
*	Listen through the wall first to confirm the room is empty
*	Reconsider another option
What's your call?
Wal breach
Nov 30
Rolling stealth checks for the wall breach operation
 
WALL BREACH - MESSY BUT COMPLETE
You and Kessa work as quietly as possible, but it's harder than you hoped.
Phase 1: The mortar crumbles away, but one of your pick strikes sends a 
scraping sound down the corridor. You both freeze. Nothing. You continue.
Phase 2: You're pulling stones out carefully when one shifts wrong - a 
loud SCRAPE echoes in the confined space. Both of you go perfectly still, 
hearts pounding, listening.
Silence. Maybe no one heard. Maybe they did and they're coming. You can't 
tell.
After thirty tense seconds, you decide to keep going. You've come too far to 
stop now.
Phase 3: Widening the hole, dust and small debris patter to the floor louder 
than you'd like. Kessa winces with each sound, but you push through.
Finally - finally - you have an opening. About two feet wide, low to the ground. 
A tight squeeze, but passable.
"Done," Kessa whispers, wiping stone dust from her face. "But we weren't 
quiet. If anyone was nearby..."
She doesn't finish. You both know the risk.
Through the hole, your Devil's Sight reveals what's beyond:
WELLFAST'S QUARTERS - WHAT YOU SEE:
Checking if Wellfast is in his quarters
 
WELLFAST'S QUARTERS - EMPTY
You peer through the hole. The room beyond is dark, but your Devil's Sight 
cuts through it easily. It's surprisingly luxurious for a Duergar commander - a 
large bed with thick furs, weapon racks displaying quality arms, a desk piled 
with maps and documents, an ornate wardrobe.
Most importantly: empty.
No Wellfast. No guards. Just his personal chambers, unoccupied.
"He's not here," you whisper to Kessa. "We're clear."
Relief washes over her face. "Then let's move. Fast. Find that sapphire rod and 
get out before he comes back."
You crawl through the hole first, then help Kessa through. You both stand in 
Wellfast's private quarters, your hex still active and thrumming with dark 
energy, ready for trouble.
TIME TO SEARCH:
You need to find the sapphire crystal component. According to the note you 
found, it's here somewhere.
Where do you search first?
*	The desk (maps, papers, maybe a hidden compartment)
*	The wardrobe (personal effects, hidden safes)
*	Under the bed (classic hiding spot)
*	The weapon racks (might be disguised among the weapons)
*	Systematically search everything (takes longer but thorough)
Remember: You've been in the complex for a while now. Multiple bodies. 
The longer you stay, the higher the risk.
What's your approach?
