SALTMERE PORT OPERATION - SESSION SUMMARY Mission Context: 
Following the Thornhaven rescue, Johannes and Kessa tracked the slaving 
operation to Saltmere Port. Intelligence gathered: Harbor Master Voss 
coordinates local operations, Captain Drevik commands the slave ship Iron 
Tide (arrives dawn tomorrow), Commander Gharash oversees regional 
operations for Verminaard. Approximately 40-50 prisoners held in cells 
beneath eastern warehouse. 20+ guards total, some conflicted about their 
work. Key Ally: Garrick - conflicted guard who provided intel. He and 3 others 
(Tomms, Rickard, Olev) will create distraction at dawn when ship arrives. 
Garrick covering for tonight's activities. Voss Assassination (Successful): * 
Midnight ambush at warehouse loading dock * Swam in using Cloak of Manta 
Ray + Gillweed extract (no traces) * Sleep grenade dropped both bodyguards 
* Hex + dual Eldritch Blast wounded Voss (26 damage) * Rope of 
Entanglement restrained him * All three eliminated, bodies weighted and sunk 
in harbor * Looted: 80 gold, warehouse keys, Voss's rapier (magical, now 
Kessa's), bronze Takhisis medallion, sealed letter Letter Intel: Ship arrives dawn. 
Voss's cut was 30 gold per prisoner. Gharash inspecting operations "within the 
week." Operation is expanding. Current Combat - Warehouse: Used Minor 
Illusion (Voss's voice) to lure 4 guards up from holding cells. Surprise round 
eliminated 2 guards (Kessa's sneak attack + Johannes's Hex/EB combo). 2 
guards remaining, just realized they're under attack. Initiative Order: * Kessa: 
19 * Johannes: 15 * Guards (2): 9 Current Status: * Johannes: 39/39 HP, 2/2 
spell slots (Hex active on dead guard, can transfer) * Kessa: 38/38 HP, new 
magical rapier * Location: Main warehouse floor, ambush position near 
stairway to cells * Time: Just past midnight, ~6 hours until ship arrives * Items: 
1 sleep grenade remaining, 2 antidotes, Rope of Entanglement (used, 
recovered) Round 1 - Kessa's turn Ready to continue!

WAREHOUSE AMBUSH - ROUND 1
KESSA'S TURN
The two remaining guards stumble back, shields raised, trying to process what 
just happened. Their companions lie dead at their feet, and the "Harbor 
Master's" voice that lured them up has vanished into threatening silence.
Kessa moves like smoke, her new rapier singing as she darts forward. The 
blade feels perfectly weighted, responsive in a way her old weapon never was.
Kessa's Attack Roll (Sneak Attack advantage - surprise situation):
*	First roll: 16 + 6 = 22 to hit
*	Second roll (advantage): 11 + 6 = 17
The rapier finds the gap between breastplate and gorget. The guard gasps, 
clutching at his throat as blood wells between his fingers.
Damage Roll:
*	Rapier: 6 + 3 = 9 piercing
*	Sneak Attack: 2d6 = 5 + 3 = 8
*	Total: 17 damage
The guard drops to one knee, still alive but badly wounded (5 HP remaining). 
His companion backs toward the warehouse doors, clearly weighing whether 
to raise an alarm.
 
JOHANNES'S TURN
Your move. The Hex curse still thrums in your consciousness, its dark energy 
seeking a new target after the guard's death. One guard is wounded and 
kneeling, the other is backing toward the exit-and potential reinforcements.
Your resources:
*	Hex ready to transfer (bonus action)
*	2/2 spell slots remaining
*	Perfect position for Eldritch Blast
*	Sleep grenade if needed (but risky with noise)
Tactical considerations:
*	Wounded guard might surrender
*	Healthy guard heading for doors (30 feet away)
*	Unknown number of guards still below in cells
*	Need to keep this quiet if possible
What's your action?
Hex and Double EB for healthy guard
Dec 5
WAREHOUSE AMBUSH - ROUND 1 
(CONTINUED)
JOHANNES'S TURN
The Hex curse releases its grip on the dead guard's soul and you redirect its 
malevolent energy toward the guard retreating to the doors. Dark tendrils of 
necrotic power coil around him as he realizes-too late-that he's the primary 
threat.
Hex Transfer (Bonus Action): Curse moves to healthy guard fleeing 
toward exit.
Your hands weave the familiar patterns, eldritch energy crackling between 
your fingers. Two bolts of force scream across the warehouse floor.
 
First Eldritch Blast:
*	Attack Roll: 14 + 7 = 21 to hit ?
*	Damage: 5 + 4 (Agonizing Blast) = 9 force damage
The first bolt catches him between the shoulder blades. He staggers but keeps 
moving.
Second Eldritch Blast:
*	Attack Roll: 18 + 7 = 25 to hit ?
*	Damage: 8 + 4 (Agonizing Blast) = 12 force damage
The second bolt punches through his back and erupts from his chest in a spray 
of purple-white energy. He drops face-first, sliding the last few feet toward the 
doors before going still.
 
GUARDS' TURN
The wounded guard on one knee looks at his three dead companions, then at 
Kessa's blood-slicked rapier, then at your still-glowing hands.
Wisdom Save (DC 10 to avoid being frightened):
*	Roll: 6 - 1 = 5 (fails)
His shield clatters to the floor. His sword follows.
"Please," he gasps, one hand still pressed to his bleeding neck. "I got a family 
in Hillsford. Kids. I-I didn't sign up for this slaving business, just needed the 
coin..."
 
ROUND 1 COMPLETE
Current Status:
*	3 guards dead, 1 surrendered (wounded, 5 HP)
*	Warehouse main floor secured
*	Hex active on dead guard at doors (can transfer)
*	No alarm raised yet
*	Prisoner cells still below with unknown guard presence
The surrendered guard trembles, blood seeping through his fingers. He's 
genuinely terrified and seems truthful about his family.
What do you do with him?
Take him back into the cells and lock him up. Check the conditions of the rest 
of the captured.
Dec 5
SECURING THE WAREHOUSE
PRISONER PROCESSING
"You'll live if you cooperate," you tell the guard, producing a length of rope. 
"Try anything and you won't see those kids again."
Kessa keeps her rapier ready while you bind his hands efficiently-tight 
enough to hold, loose enough he won't lose fingers. He doesn't resist, just nods 
frantically.
"How many guards below?" you ask quietly.
"T-two," he stammers. "Marcus and Joff. They're probably wondering what 
happened to us..."
 
DESCENDING TO THE CELLS
The stairway leads down into torch-lit dimness. The air grows thick with the 
smell of unwashed bodies, fear-sweat, and waste buckets. Stone walls weep 
moisture.
You reach the bottom to find a guard station-empty, the two guards likely 
patrolling. The holding area sprawls before you: a dozen cells lining both walls 
of a long corridor. Faces press against bars.
Perception Check (Johannes): 11 + 1 = 12 Perception Check 
(Kessa): 16 + 4 = 20
Kessa touches your arm, gestures down the corridor. Two guards at the far 
end, backs turned, checking cells. They haven't heard you yet over the 
prisoners' murmuring.
 
THE PRISONERS
Your torchlight reveals the cargo Voss was preparing to ship:
Count: Approximately 45-50 people crammed into cells meant for half that 
number.
Condition:
*	Malnourished - visible ribs, hollow cheeks
*	Dehydrated - cracked lips, listless movements
*	Injured - untreated cuts, bruises from rough handling
*	Terrified - some cower at your approach, others watch with desperate 
hope
*	Sick - you hear coughing, see fever-bright eyes
Demographics:
*	Mostly civilians from Thornhaven and surrounding villages
*	Mix of ages-young adults to elderly (no young children, mercifully)
*	A few look like they might have been town guards or militia
*	Several wear the simple clothing of farmers, craftspeople, merchants
Cell Conditions:
*	Packed 4-6 per cell designed for 2
*	Single waste bucket per cell (overflowing in some)
*	No bedding, prisoners sleeping on stone
*	Water buckets nearly empty
*	Iron bars rusted but solid
 
One woman near the front grips the bars, recognizing hope when she sees it. 
"Please," she whispers hoarsely. "Are you... did someone send help?"
Meanwhile: The two guards at the far end are still oblivious, about 60 feet 
away. Your bound prisoner stands silent beside you, not daring to raise alarm.
What's your approach?
*	Deal with the two guards first (stealth or direct)
*	Start releasing prisoners (but guards will notice)
*	Send Kessa to handle guards while you prep prisoners
*	Other strategy?
Remember, Devils Sight, no lights.
Dec 5
SECURING THE WAREHOUSE - 
CORRECTED
DESCENDING TO THE CELLS
Right-you extinguish the torches as you descend. Darkness swallows the 
stairwell, but your Devil's Sight pierces it effortlessly. The bound guard 
stumbles beside you in the blackness, terrified.
Kessa moves close, one hand on your shoulder to guide herself. "Can't see a 
damn thing," she whispers. "Talk me through it."
 
THE SCENE BELOW
Through the absolute darkness, you see everything clearly:
Guard Station: Empty desk with logbook, ring of keys hanging on wall, two 
chairs.
The Corridor: Stretches 80 feet, cells lining both sides. Torches in sconces 
provide light for the guards-making them night-blind and you invisible.
The Two Guards (60 feet away):
*	Standing in torchlight, completely unaware
*	One is writing something in a ledger
*	The other is eating an apple, leaning against the wall
*	Neither is armored-just leather jerkins and clubs
*	They're relaxed, bored, not expecting trouble
The Prisoners: 45-50 people as previously described. Most are sleeping 
fitfully. Those awake can't see you in the darkness beyond the torchlight's 
reach, but some sense movement.
 
TACTICAL ADVANTAGE
You have perfect surprise conditions:
*	You: See everything perfectly, invisible in darkness
*	Kessa: Blind but can follow your lead
*	Guards: Night-blind from torchlight, completely unaware
*	Bound prisoner: Terrified, compliant, blind
The woman who whispered earlier squints into the darkness, seeing nothing. 
She hasn't raised her voice-not wanting to alert the guards to whatever might 
be happening.
 
Your approach?
You could:
*	Sneak up solo (they literally cannot see you coming)
*	Have Kessa wait here while you handle both
*	Sleep grenade from darkness (instant win, but wastes resource)
*	Hex + double EB from shadows (they won't even see where it comes 
from)
*	Something else?
Current Status:
*	Hex curse available (currently on dead guard upstairs)
*	2/2 spell slots
*	Perfect stealth positioning
*	Guards 60 feet away in torchlight
What's your move?
Hex on Apple eater, one EB bolt each, then suggest Kessa uses Dancing Lights 
to confuse them both for Round 1.
Dec 5
CELL BLOCK AMBUSH - ROUND 1
JOHANNES'S TURN (SURPRISE ROUND)
You whisper the plan to Kessa, who nods in the darkness she can't see 
through. "On your signal."
The Hex curse unfurls from your mind, reaching out through the blackness to 
coil around the apple-eating guard. He shivers suddenly, rubbing his arms, 
not understanding the doom that's settled on him.
Hex (Bonus Action): Apple-eater cursed.
Your hands move in the familiar patterns, twin bolts of eldritch force 
screaming out of the pitch darkness.
 
First Eldritch Blast (targeting Apple-eater):
*	Attack Roll: 9 + 7 = 16 to hit
*	Guard AC: 13 (leather armor) ?
*	Damage: 7 + 4 (Agonizing Blast) = 11 force damage
The apple explodes in his hand as the bolt catches him in the chest. He flies 
backward into the cell bars with a grunt of pain and confusion.
Second Eldritch Blast (targeting Ledger-writer):
*	Attack Roll: 13 + 7 = 20 to hit ?
*	Damage: 3 + 4 (Agonizing Blast) = 7 force damage
The second guard drops his quill, clutching his shoulder where the bolt burned 
through. Both men spin toward the darkness, seeing nothing but black void 
beyond their torchlight.
"What the-where-?!"
 
KESSA'S TURN (SURPRISE ROUND)
"Now, Keys!"
Kessa casts Dancing Lights: Four motes of illumination spark into 
existence-but not where the guards expect. She sends them dancing 
erratically through the corridor:
*	One zips past Apple-eater's head (he flinches)
*	Two spiral around Ledger-writer in opposite directions
*	One hovers right at eye level between them
The guards spin, trying to track multiple threats, clubs raised uselessly. They 
still can't see you-just mysterious lights appearing from nowhere and 
invisible attackers in the dark.
"It's a wizard!" Apple-eater shouts. "Sound the-"
 
ROLLING INITIATIVE
Initiative Rolls:
*	Kessa: 15 + 4 = 19
*	Johannes: 8 + 2 = 10
*	Apple-eater: 11 + 1 = 12
*	Ledger-writer: 6 + 1 = 7
Initiative Order: Kessa (19) ? Apple-eater (12) ? Johannes (10) ? Ledger-
writer (7)
 
ROUND 1 - KESSA'S TURN
The guards are disoriented, wounded, and terrified. Kessa can't see them, but 
she knows roughly where they are from your description and their shouting.
"Point me!" she hisses.
What guidance do you give Kessa?
*	She could close distance and attack (with disadvantage-she's blind)
*	Continue manipulating Dancing Lights to disorient them
*	Hold action for your signal
*	Something else?
Current Status:
*	Apple-eater: 11 damage taken, Hexed, trying to sound alarm
*	Ledger-writer: 7 damage taken, disoriented
*	Both guards can't see you at all
*	Prisoners starting to stir and whisper
*	Your bound prisoner still beside you in darkness
What's the plan?
Shouldn't the Dancing Lights give her enough light for dim conditions?
Dec 5
CELL BLOCK AMBUSH - ROUND 1 
(CORRECTED)
KESSA'S TURN
You're absolutely right-the Dancing Lights provide illumination. Kessa can 
see the guards clearly now, lit by her own magical lights dancing around them.
The guards are disoriented, spinning to track the moving lights while trying to 
locate their attackers. Apple-eater is clutching his chest where your blast hit, 
Ledger-writer's shoulder is smoking.
Kessa draws her new rapier and moves with lethal grace, using the guards' 
confusion.
Kessa's Attack (Sneak Attack - target has disadvantage from 
disorientation):
*	Attack Roll: 18 + 6 = 24 to hit ?
The rapier finds Apple-eater's kidney. He gasps, the alarm dying in his throat.
Damage Roll:
*	Rapier: 4 + 3 = 7 piercing
*	Sneak Attack: 3d6 = 4 + 2 + 5 = 11
*	Total: 18 damage
He collapses against the cell bars, sliding down to sit heavily. Still conscious 
but badly hurt (bleeding out, barely standing).
 
APPLE-EATER'S TURN
He's wounded, terrified, and can't see his main attacker in the darkness. He 
sees Kessa clearly in the Dancing Lights, but the eldritch blasts came from the 
void.
Wisdom Save (DC 10 to avoid being frightened):
*	Roll: 4 + 1 = 5 (fails)
"Demon! There's a demon!" He drops his club and scrambles away from 
Kessa, pressing his back against the far wall. His hands shake as he fumbles at 
his belt-looking for something to throw? A whistle to raise alarm?
 
JOHANNES'S TURN
You stand in perfect darkness, watching through Devil's Sight as the scene 
plays out. Apple-eater is panicking. Ledger-writer is trying to locate you in the 
darkness beyond the lights.
Your move:
*	Hex is active on Apple-eater
*	2/2 spell slots remaining
*	You're still completely invisible to them
*	Prisoners watching in confused hope
What do you do?
Same, 2 Eb blasts, one each.
Dec 5
CELL BLOCK AMBUSH - ROUND 1 
(CONTINUED)
JOHANNES'S TURN
You remain a phantom in the darkness, your hands weaving death from the 
void. The guards can see Kessa, can see the Dancing Lights-but you're 
hunting them from pure shadow.
 
First Eldritch Blast (targeting Apple-eater - Hexed):
*	Attack Roll: 19 + 7 = 26 to hit ?
*	Damage: 10 + 4 (Agonizing Blast) = 14 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 1d6 = 4 necrotic
*	Total: 18 damage
The bolt strikes him center mass as he fumbles for his belt. The necrotic curse 
amplifies the impact, and he crumples without a sound-dead before he hits 
the stone floor.
Second Eldritch Blast (targeting Ledger-writer):
*	Attack Roll: 11 + 7 = 18 to hit ?
*	Damage: 6 + 4 (Agonizing Blast) = 10 force damage
Ledger-writer spins toward the source of the blasts-still seeing nothing-as 
purple-white energy slams into his chest. He staggers back, gasping, blood 
trickling from his mouth.
 
LEDGER-WRITER'S TURN
He's wounded (17 damage total), alone, his partner dead, facing an invisible 
demon-summoner and a deadly woman with Dancing Lights.
Morale Check:
*	Roll: 3 (automatically fails)
His club clatters to the floor. "I surrender! Don't-please-I'm done!" His 
hands shoot up, trembling violently.
 
ROUND 1 COMPLETE
Current Status:
*	Apple-eater: Dead
*	Ledger-writer: Surrendered, badly wounded
*	Bound guard from upstairs: Still compliant
*	Hex curse: Available to transfer
*	Spell slots: 2/2
The prisoners are fully awake now, pressing against their cell bars. They can 
see Kessa in the Dancing Lights, see the surrendered guard, see the dead one 
on the floor-but they still can't see you in the darkness beyond.
The same woman from before speaks, voice stronger now: "You're really here. 
You're really... thank the gods."
 
What now?
*	Interrogate the surrendered guard?
*	Grab the keys and start releasing prisoners?
*	Secure both surviving guards first?
*	Check the logbook?
Put the wounded guy in with the other wounded guard after searching them.
Dec 5
SECURING THE CELLS
SEARCHING THE GUARDS
You step forward from the darkness, and several prisoners gasp as you 
seemingly materialize from nothing. Kessa's Dancing Lights illuminate your 
work as you search both wounded guards.
Ledger-writer's possessions:
*	8 gold pieces
*	Simple iron key (cell key-matches the ring on the wall)
*	Half-eaten bread and cheese in his pocket
*	Wooden club (standard)
*	Waterskin (half full)
Bound guard from upstairs (re-search):
*	12 gold pieces
*	Small knife (already confiscated)
*	Letter from someone named "Mara"-his wife, talking about their 
children's upcoming harvest festival performance
 
CELL ASSIGNMENT
You guide both wounded guards to an empty cell in the middle of the 
corridor-one that gives them no angle on the exit or guard station. Ledger-
writer limps along without resistance. Your original prisoner still clutches his 
bleeding neck.
Kessa's Medicine Check (binding their wounds):
*	Roll: 14 + 1 = 15
She tears strips from their shirts and binds the worst wounds. "You'll live," she 
says flatly. "Assuming you stay quiet and cooperative."
Both men nod frantically. You lock the cell door with a satisfying clunk.
"What happens to us?" Ledger-writer asks quietly.
 
THE GUARD STATION
With the immediate threat neutralized, you examine the area more carefully:
Key Ring on wall: Contains keys for all twelve cells plus what looks like a 
master key.
Logbook on desk (open to today's entries):
Day 47 - 49 prisoners total
- 3 more from western villages arrived 
- Old man (cell 7) died overnight - disposed
- Iron Tide confirmed for dawn delivery
- Captain Drevik expects 50+ for transport
- Harbor Master says final payment on delivery
Additional notes in margins: Guard rotation schedules, meal times (twice 
daily-thin gruel), prisoner behavioral notes ("cell 4 troublemakers," "cell 9 
cooperative").
Supplies: Stack of wooden bowls, water buckets, the bare minimum to keep 
people alive for transport.
 
THE PRISONERS
The woman at the front cell speaks again: "I'm Mera. From Thornhaven-we 
were taken three days ago." She looks at the others. "Most of us are from there 
or the villages nearby. Some have been here over a week."
Faces press against every cell bar now, hope and fear warring in their 
expressions. They're weak, frightened, but you can see the spark of survival 
still burning.
Tactical situation:
*	2 guards secured, 4 dead upstairs
*	~6 hours until Iron Tide arrives at dawn
*	47 living prisoners needing evacuation
*	Unknown if other guards will check in during the night
*	Bodies upstairs need handling
*	Garrick and his allies creating distraction at dawn
What's your next move?
Free Mera and then Visit Cell 4 - the troublemakers first.
Dec 5
LIBERATING THE PRISONERS
FREEING MERA
You take the key ring from the wall and approach her cell. The lock clicks 
open-the first taste of freedom in three days.
Mera stumbles out, legs unsteady from confinement. She's in her thirties, 
wearing the practical clothes of a Thornhaven shopkeeper, now filthy and 
torn. Despite her condition, there's steel in her eyes.
"Thank you," she says simply, then steadies herself against the bars. "What do 
you need from me?"
Kessa offers her the waterskin. Mera drinks deeply, then wipes her mouth. "I 
can help organize people once you let them out. Some are in bad shape-the 
elderly, the sick. We'll need to move carefully."
 
CELL 4 - THE TROUBLEMAKERS
You approach the fourth cell on the left. Five prisoners inside, all young men 
in their twenties. Unlike the others who look beaten down, these five have a 
different energy-coiled, angry, waiting.
One steps forward as you approach. Broad-shouldered, farmer's build, 
bandaged knuckles. He's been fighting.
"About damn time someone showed up," he says, voice low but intense. "I'm 
Garrett. These are my brothers-Finn, Cole-and our friends Jax and Petyr." 
He gestures to the others. "We're from Hillsford village. Took eight of 
Verminaard's bastards to bring us down."
The others nod. They're injured but not broken-bruised faces, split lips, but 
their eyes are sharp and calculating.
Garrett continues: "We've been planning. Once that ship arrives, we 
figured we'd try something during the transfer-create chaos, maybe some of 
us could escape." He looks at you directly. "But you've got something better 
planned, yeah? We can fight. We want to fight."
Finn (younger, leaner) adds: "We know this dock. Grew up fishing here 
before Verminaard's forces moved in. We know the warehouse layouts, the 
alleys, where guards patrol."
Cole (the quietest one) speaks up: "And we've got scores to settle. They 
killed our da when we resisted."
The five of them watch you with desperate intensity-men who've been caged 
like animals and are ready to bite back.
 
Mera observes quietly: "They've been talking about fighting since they 
arrived. The guards beat them twice for 'insubordination.' Some of the other 
prisoners think they're reckless... but they've got spirit."
 
What do you tell them?
Current tactical situation:
*	Dawn is ~6 hours away
*	Garrick's distraction will happen when ship arrives
*	47 prisoners to evacuate
*	These five want to fight, not just run
*	They have local knowledge of Saltmere Port
Do you:
*	Recruit them for the fight?
*	Tell them to focus on protecting other prisoners during evacuation?
*	Get their intelligence about the dock layout?
*	Something else?
Real violence is foiling Verminaard's plans, not killing down-on-their luck 
humans. Besides, I am sure your da would want you to care for the women 
and children first, not spit yourselves on the first swords someone swings at 
you. Get these folks out and then we can talk.
Dec 5
CELL 4 - REALITY CHECK
GARRETT'S REACTION
Your words land like cold water. Garrett's jaw tightens, and for a moment you 
think he might argue-but then something shifts in his expression. The hot 
anger cools into something harder, more useful.
"You're right," he says quietly, glancing at his brothers. "Da always said anger 
without purpose just gets you killed." He looks back at you. "We get people 
out. That's the mission."
Finn nods slowly: "Foiling their whole operation-that's the real revenge. 
Not just... swinging at whoever's in front of us."
Cole's voice is thick: "Da would clip us all upside the head for putting 
vengeance before helping folk who need it."
Jax (the stockiest one) cracks his knuckles: "Still wouldn't mind 
putting down anyone who gets in the way of the evacuation though."
Petyr (youngest, maybe 20) adds: "And we do know the docks. The safe 
routes out, where to avoid patrols. That's useful, yeah?"
 
GARRETT'S OFFER
Garrett extends his hand through the bars. "You've got our help. Proper help-
getting people out safe, using our heads instead of just our fists."
He pauses, then continues: "But answer me this-what happens after? Once 
we're out, Verminaard's forces are still here. Saltmere's still under his thumb. 
Do we just... run and hope they don't come hunting for us?"
The question hangs in the torchlit air. It's practical, not confrontational-he 
wants to understand the bigger picture.
Mera speaks up from behind you: "He's asking what I think we're all 
wondering. You came for us, which means you're fighting Verminaard 
somehow. What's the actual plan? Just rescue and scatter? Or is there more to 
this?"
The other prisoners are listening now-those close enough to hear are 
watching your exchange with Garrett with intense interest.
 
How do you answer?
The truth is complex:
*	You need tribute for your patron (though they don't need to know that)
*	Verminaard's operation is expanding
*	Gharash is coming "within the week"
*	The regional slave network needs disrupting
*	These people need somewhere safe to go
What do you tell them about the bigger picture?
Verminaard is too big a force for anyone to take on by themselves. Get 
yourselves to Haven, we can begin to form some kind of resistance there. And 
you can swell the ranks by telling those who resist your story far better than 
we can. We have plans, though. Voss has already paid his dues, it sounds like 
this captain whatever his name is, has a past due death tax he wasn't aware he 
owed and we aim to collect.
Dec 5
SETTING EXPECTATIONS
THE RESPONSE
Your words carry the weight of hard truth. Garrett's eyes sharpen-he 
recognizes someone who's actually thought this through, not just swinging 
wildly at shadows.
"Haven," he repeats, nodding slowly. "Makes sense. It's far enough from 
Verminaard's main forces, close enough to reach. And if the stories are true, 
there are others gathering there who want to resist."
Finn grins darkly: "Voss paid his dues? Good. That bastard watched them 
drag our da away and just... counted his gold."
Mera's voice is quiet but carries: "Captain Drevik. That's the name you're 
looking for. He commands the Iron Tide-he's the one who actually ships us. 
Voss just collected the merchandise." Her face hardens. "Drevik's got blood on 
his hands from a dozen ports."
Garrett extends his hand again through the bars: "Then we're with 
you. We get everyone to Haven, we spread the word about what happened 
here-about people actually fighting back. And you..." He meets your eyes. 
"You make sure that ship captain doesn't sail away clean."
Cole speaks up: "There's probably twenty families between Hillsford and 
Thornhaven who'll want to hear our story. Who'll want to know there's a place 
to gather, a chance to push back."
Jax adds: "And we can help organize the evacuation. Get people moving in 
the right direction, keep them together. We're no good scattered."
 
PETYR'S PRACTICAL QUESTION
The youngest of them steps forward: "How are we actually getting out? Dawn's 
maybe six hours away. That's 47 people-some sick, some old, some who can 
barely walk. Saltmere's crawling with Verminaard's troops. Even with a 
distraction..."
He's not doubting-he's planning. Asking the right tactical questions.
Mera nods: "He's right. The distraction from your contact helps, but moving 
this many people? We need a route, a destination, and a way to keep them 
together without being spotted."
 
THE TACTICAL REALITY
They're looking to you for leadership now. The situation:
Assets:
*	Garrick + 3 guards creating distraction at dawn
*	Local knowledge from Garrett's group
*	~6 hours until ship arrives
*	Keys to all cells
*	Warehouse access
Challenges:
*	47 prisoners, various conditions
*	Unknown patrol schedules in Saltmere
*	Need to avoid raising alarm before dawn
*	Bodies upstairs will eventually be discovered
*	Verminaard's forces throughout the port
The Question: What's your evacuation plan?
Do you:
*	Release everyone now and start moving them immediately?
*	Wait until closer to dawn when Garrick's distraction begins?
*	Send scouts (Garrett's group?) to map the safest route?
*	Use the warehouse as a staging area?
*	Something else?
What's the plan, Johannes?
We're in a fairly large harbor. There is probably a ship somewhere that can 
help us avoid taking a land route that would just leave folks to be caught. A 
sloop or something could ferry folks outside the city far quicker and without 
distressing the elderly and sick.

MARITIME EVACUATION PLAN
GARRETT'S EXPERTISE
Garrett's eyes light up with recognition. "You're thinking like a sailor. Smart." 
He turns to his brothers. "Finn, you remember the Wayward Gull?"
Finn nods eagerly: "Captain Marna's ship-she's no friend of Verminaard. 
Her crew got pressed into 'taxes' twice. She's been taking fishing contracts but 
she's got a proper sloop, could handle fifty easy if they're willing to be cozy."
Petyr adds: "Last I saw, the Gull was moored on the western docks-
opposite side from where the Iron Tide comes in. Marna keeps her distance 
from the military berths."
Garrett continues: "Problem is, Marna won't risk her ship and crew 
without good reason-or good coin. Verminaard catches her smuggling 
refugees, she's done. They'd burn her ship and hang her crew."
 
MERA'S CALCULATION
"How much coin are we talking?" Mera asks. "Between all of us, we might 
scrape together... maybe 30 gold? Our families in Thornhaven might have 
more, but that doesn't help us now."
She looks at the gold you took from the guards. "Unless you're willing to use 
Voss's blood money for something useful?"
 
KESSA'S INPUT
Keys steps close, speaking quietly so only you hear: "We've got about 90 gold 
from Voss and the guards. Could be enough to convince a captain to risk it." 
She pauses. "Or... there's Voss's letter. Could forge something-official 
looking-saying she's been commandeered for 'military transport.' Risky, but 
wouldn't cost us coin."
She glances at the prisoners. "We could also just... commandeer the ship 
ourselves. Board it, convince the crew it's in their interest to help. Though 
that's aggressive and might go wrong."
 
PETYR'S CONCERN
"There's also timing," the young man points out. "If we move everyone to the 
western docks now-middle of the night-and the Gull isn't ready or won't 
help, we've got 47 people exposed with nowhere to go. But if we wait until 
dawn when Garrick's distraction starts..."
Garrett finishes the thought: "The distraction's on the eastern docks 
where the Iron Tide comes in. Western docks might be quieter, but we'd be 
moving everyone across the port during the chaos. Could work for us or 
against us."
 
THE OPTIONS
Option 1 - Buy Passage (90 gold available):
*	Approach Captain Marna honestly, offer payment
*	Clean, straightforward, but expensive
*	She might still refuse if too risky
Option 2 - Forge Authorization:
*	Use Voss's letterhead/seal to create fake orders
*	Saves money, but requires deception check
*	Falls apart if anyone verifies with command
Option 3 - Commandeer the Ship:
*	Board and "convince" crew to help
*	Aggressive, potentially violent
*	Crew might resist or alert authorities
Option 4 - Hybrid Approach:
*	Scout the Gull first (you or Kessa)
*	Assess Captain Marna's disposition
*	Decide approach based on intel
Timing consideration:
*	Move prisoners now (risky, but more time to board)
*	Wait for dawn distraction (chaotic, but better cover)
 
What's your call, Johannes?
You've got local knowledge now. How do you want to approach Captain Marna 
and the Wayward Gull?
Buy passage. It is the most direct and honest approach with the least level of 
complexity.
Dec 5
THE MARITIME SOLUTION
ORGANIZING THE PLAN
"We buy passage," you say firmly. "Honest coin, honest deal. Captain Marna 
gets paid well for one night's work, and we don't add complications we don't 
need."
Garrett nods approvingly. "Straightforward. I like it. And 90 gold-that's more 
than Marna would make in two months of fishing contracts. She'd be a fool to 
refuse."
Mera speaks up: "Who approaches her? If you two show up-strangers, 
middle of the night, asking to smuggle fifty people-that might spook her. But 
if some of us came along..." She gestures to Garrett's group. "We're locals. 
Some of us know her crew. Might make it feel less like a trap."
Kessa considers: "Fair point. Though we're also the ones with the coin and 
the... persuasive capabilities if things go sideways." She touches her rapier 
meaningfully.
 
GARRETT'S LOCAL INTEL
"Marna's crew is small-maybe eight people total," Garrett offers. "She runs a 
tight ship, literally. No-nonsense woman, mid-forties, been sailing these 
waters for twenty years. Lost her husband to one of Verminaard's 'recruitment 
drives' two years back-he was pressed into service and never came home."
Finn adds: "She hates the Dragon Army, but she's pragmatic. Won't throw 
her life away on principle, but she'll take a risk if the odds are decent."
Cole: "The Gull can handle coastal waters easily. Could drop everyone at 
Haven's harbor or even one of the smaller fishing villages along the way if we 
want to spread people out."
 
THE APPROACH PLAN
Petyr suggests: "Here's what makes sense-you scout the Gull first. Make 
sure she's actually there and assess the situation. Then approach Marna with 
the offer. If she agrees, we start moving prisoners in small groups to avoid 
attention. Use the warehouse access to get them to the docks quietly."
Mera nods: "And we should have a story ready. If anyone asks, we're... dock 
workers? Moving cargo? Though at night that's thin..."
Kessa grins: "Or we just move fast and quiet. Your Devil's Sight means we 
can navigate in darkness better than any patrol. We get people to the ship, 
they board quickly, and the Gull slips out before dawn when the harbor's still 
quiet."
 
TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
Garrett raises a concern: "What about Garrick's distraction at dawn? If 
we're already gone when the Iron Tide arrives and he creates his diversion, 
does that put him at risk?"
That's a valid point. Garrick and his three allies are planning to create chaos 
when Captain Drevik arrives, expecting you to use that cover. If the prisoners 
are already evacuated...
Options:
1.	Leave before dawn - Get everyone out clean, but Garrick's distraction 
happens with no prisoners to "rescue" (might expose him)
2.	Coordinate timing - Use the dawn distraction as cover for final 
boarding (riskier, but protects Garrick's cover story)
3.	Leave Garrick a message/signal - Let him know plan changed so he 
can adapt
 
IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
The current plan:
1.	Free all prisoners (now)
2.	Scout the Wayward Gull (you and/or Kessa)
3.	Negotiate with Captain Marna (90 gold offer)
4.	Move prisoners to western docks
5.	Board and depart
Questions to resolve:
*	Do you free everyone now or wait until ship is secured?
*	Who goes to negotiate with Marna? (Just you two, or bring locals like 
Garrett?)
*	What about Garrick's situation at dawn?
*	Where exactly should the Gull take refugees? (Haven harbor, smaller 
village, multiple drops?)
What's your call on these details?
Let Mera and the boys get everyone squared away. The plan will be for the 
Wayward Gull, should the captain prove amenable, to sail here, cuts down on 
travel or exposure for the prisoners, then take everyone to Haven. In the 
meantime, we find Garrick, and explain the situation, inviting him to go to 
Haven as well. If he can get to the warehouse, we will negotiate for he and his 
companions to join.
Dec 5
DIVIDING THE WORK
ORGANIZING THE EVACUATION
You turn to Mera and Garrett. "Get everyone freed and organized. Keep them 
calm and quiet. We're going to secure transport-a ship that will come here to 
the warehouse docks. Less distance for people to travel, less exposure."
Mera nods decisively: "We can do that. I'll handle the elderly and sick, 
make sure they're ready to move when the time comes."
Garrett gestures to his brothers: "We'll get people sorted by mobility-
who can move fast, who needs help, who needs carrying. And we'll keep watch 
on those two." He jerks his thumb toward the cell holding the captured guards.
You hand them the key ring. "Keep it quiet. No celebrations, no loud talking. 
We need maybe an hour, two at most."
Finn grins: "You bring us a ship, we'll have everyone ready to board faster 
than Verminaard can count his coins."
 
FINDING GARRICK
You and Kessa ascend the stairs, leaving the prisoners to their work. The four 
dead guards upstairs are a grim reminder of what's at stake.
"Garrick said he was covering for tonight's activities," Kessa murmurs. "He's 
probably on patrol somewhere, trying to look normal while wondering what 
the hell we're doing down here."
Where to find him:
You recall from your earlier intel gathering that Garrick was one of the gate 
guards-the ones who watch the main warehouse district entrance. If he's 
covering for the missing guards, he might be:
1.	At the main gate (most likely-maintaining his normal post)
2.	Patrolling near the warehouses (checking on why no one's reported 
in)
3.	At the guard barracks (risky-other soldiers present)
The warehouse district is quiet at this hour-past midnight, most legitimate 
work stopped hours ago. A few torches illuminate patrol routes, but your 
Devil's Sight makes the darkness your ally.
 
APPROACHING THE GATE
Perception Check (Johannes): 18 + 1 = 19
You spot Garrick at the main gate, standing with another guard you don't 
recognize. They're talking in low voices, and Garrick keeps glancing toward the 
eastern warehouse-your location-with poorly concealed tension.
The other guard is older, grizzled, with the bearing of a career soldier. He's 
armed and armored properly, unlike some of the sloppier guards you've dealt 
with.
Kessa whispers: "That's a problem. Garrick's not alone, and that other one 
looks competent. We need to get him aside without spooking his companion 
or blowing his cover."
 
YOUR OPTIONS
Option 1 - Signal Garrick:
*	Use Minor Illusion or another subtle method to catch his attention
*	Lure him away from his post naturally
*	Risk: Other guard might notice something odd
Option 2 - Direct Approach:
*	Walk up openly (bold, but Garrick knows you)
*	Claim you have "Harbor Master's business"
*	Risk: Other guard might question authority
Option 3 - Wait for patrol separation:
*	Watch until guards split up for rounds
*	Intercept Garrick alone
*	Risk: Time-ship negotiation is time-sensitive
Option 4 - Kessa's distraction:
*	She creates a reason for Garrick to investigate alone
*	You stay hidden as backup
*	Risk: Depends on other guard's reaction
How do you want to approach this?
OPtion 2. Fortune favors the brave. Let Kessa use Performance to get the other 
guys attention while I signal Garrick
Dec 5
THE GATE APPROACH
KESSA'S PERFORMANCE
You nod to Kessa. "Get the other one's attention. I'll handle Garrick."
She grins and steps into the torchlight, stumbling slightly as if she's had too 
much to drink. Her posture shifts-less deadly rogue, more tavern worker 
finishing a long shift.
Kessa's Performance Check: 17 + 5 = 22
"'Scuse me, guardsmen," she calls out, voice pitched perfectly between friendly 
and slightly slurred. "I got turned around coming back from the Salty Dog. 
This the way to the south quarters?" She sways slightly, one hand on the wall 
for balance.
The grizzled guard's attention locks on her immediately-a lone woman, 
potentially drunk, in the warehouse district at night. His hand doesn't go to his 
weapon, but his posture shifts to professional assessment.
"Miss, the south quarters are back that way," he says, pointing. "And you 
shouldn't be wandering the docks alone this time of night. Lots of rough types 
around."
Kessa giggles, stepping closer to him. "Oh, I can handle myself usually, but the 
wine tonight was strong..." She engages him in conversation, asking for 
detailed directions, commenting on how confusing the dock layout is.
 
SIGNALING GARRICK
While the grizzled guard is focused on Kessa, you catch Garrick's eye from the 
shadows. His eyes widen slightly-recognition and relief warring with tension.
You gesture subtly: Come. Urgent. Warehouse.
Garrick clears his throat. "Rickard, I'll do a quick sweep of the eastern 
warehouse. Been too quiet from that direction-want to make sure Voss's boys 
haven't fallen asleep on duty."
Rickard waves him off, still engaged with Kessa. "Go ahead. I'll make sure this 
young lady gets pointed the right direction."
 
WAREHOUSE MEETING
Garrick follows you into the shadows between warehouses, his relief palpable 
once you're out of sight.
"Gods, I've been going crazy wondering what happened," he whispers 
urgently. "Four guards went down to check the cells hours ago and never came 
back. Voss never showed for his midnight rounds. What-"
He stops as he notices the blood on your cloak, the grim set of your 
expression.
"They're dead, aren't they? Voss and the others."
His voice is steady-not shocked, not upset. If anything, there's a grim 
satisfaction there.
 
THE NEW PLAN
You lay it out quickly and efficiently: prisoners being freed, ship evacuation to 
Haven, the whole operation changing from dawn distraction to midnight 
exodus.
Garrick listens, then nods slowly. "That's... actually better. Cleaner. No one 
dies who doesn't deserve it, and Verminaard loses his whole shipment."
He's quiet for a moment, thinking. "My part was supposed to be the 
distraction when the Iron Tide arrived. If you're gone before dawn, that 
changes things."
He considers his options: "Tomms, Olev, Rickard and I-we could come 
with you. Leave tonight, get to Haven, actually join a proper resistance instead 
of playing pretend loyalty to the Dragon Army." His jaw tightens. "Or we stay, 
act confused when the prisoners are discovered missing, maybe buy you more 
time before pursuit is organized."
Then, more quietly: "Though if we stay and they figure out we were 
involved..." He doesn't finish the thought. You both know what Verminaard 
does to traitors.
"What do you need from us?"
 
TACTICAL DECISION
Option A - Garrick & allies evacuate with prisoners:
*	Pros: They escape safely, adds 4 capable fighters to Haven's resistance
*	Cons: Their disappearance might trigger immediate 
investigation/pursuit
*	Timeline: They need to gather Tomms, Olev, and convince Rickard 
quickly
Option B - Garrick & allies stay and misdirect:
*	Pros: Delays discovery, buys evacuation more time, provides false leads
*	Cons: Extreme risk to them if discovered, requires perfect acting
*	Timeline: They have until dawn to maintain cover story
Option C - Split approach:
*	Garrick + some come with you, others stay to misdirect
*	Pros: Balanced risk/reward
*	Cons: More complex coordination
What's your call? And you still need to negotiate with Captain Marna and 
get the Wayward Gull here.
Leave, this way there is no one to trace back to anything. And Garrick and his 
companions are out from under the weight of their past choices with a chance 
to repay.
Dec 5
THE CLEAN BREAK
GARRICK'S RELIEF
You can see the weight lift from his shoulders as you speak. "Leave. All of you. 
Clean break, no traces, no one left behind who knows what really happened."
Garrick exhales slowly, like a man who's been holding his breath for months. 
"Thank you," he says quietly. "I've been... we've all been carrying this. 
Knowing what we were part of, even tangentially. Hating ourselves for it but 
not seeing a way out that didn't end with nooses."
He straightens, determination replacing uncertainty. "I can get Tomms and 
Olev quickly-they're bunked in the east barracks, light sleepers. Rickard..." 
He glances back toward the gate where Kessa is still chatting. "He's a good 
man, stuck in bad circumstances like us. I think he'll come if we ask. But I 
need maybe twenty minutes to gather them and their gear without raising 
suspicion."
Kessa appears from the shadows, grinning: "Rickard is thoroughly 
convinced I'm a harmless drunk who now knows exactly how to get to the 
south quarters. He's back on watch, none the wiser."
 
THE TIMELINE
Garrick lays it out: "Here's what I can do. I tell Rickard I'm doing extended 
rounds, gathering the others along the way. We meet at the warehouse in 
twenty minutes with our personal gear. Everything we need to disappear."
He pauses. "What's the story when we vanish? Four guards gone the same 
night as fifty prisoners and Voss? They'll know it was inside work."
Kessa shrugs: "Let them know. By the time they figure it out, you'll be in 
Haven. And it sends a message-even Verminaard's own people are turning 
against him."
Garrick nods slowly: "A message. Yeah. Maybe others will find the courage 
too." He meets your eyes. "We'll be there in twenty minutes. Don't leave 
without us."
 
THE WAYWARD GULL
With Garrick departing to gather his allies, you and Kessa make your way 
toward the western docks. The night is deep now, a few hours past midnight. 
The harbor is quiet except for the gentle slap of water against hulls and the 
creak of mooring lines.
Navigation Check (Kessa - local knowledge): 14 + 4 = 18
She leads you through back alleys and along warehouse rows, avoiding the 
main patrol routes. The western docks are indeed quieter-fishing vessels and 
merchant ships rather than military transports.
Perception Check (Johannes): 16 + 1 = 17
You spot the Wayward Gull easily enough. She's a well-maintained sloop, 
maybe 60 feet long, single-masted with a clean hull. Not fancy, but seaworthy 
and loved. Lamplight glows from the cabin-someone's awake.
Two crew members are visible on deck, doing late-night maintenance work. 
One is coiling rope, the other is checking rigging. Both look competent and 
alert.
 
APPROACHING CAPTAIN MARNA
Kessa whispers: "Direct approach? Walk up the gangplank and ask for the 
captain?"
The crew on deck haven't noticed you yet in the shadows. You could:
Option 1 - Direct Boarding:
*	Walk up openly, announce your business
*	Honest but potentially alarming at this hour
Option 2 - Hail from the Dock:
*	Call out politely, request audience with captain
*	Less aggressive, more respectful of ship protocols
Option 3 - Send Kessa First:
*	She's less intimidating, might be better received
*	You follow once initial contact is made
How do you want to make first contact with Captain Marna's crew?
OPtion 2.
Dec 5
THE WAYWARD GULL
HAILING THE SHIP
You step to the edge of the dock, staying in clear view of the lamplight so you 
don't appear to be skulking. Kessa stands beside you, hands visible and non-
threatening.
"Ahoy the Wayward Gull," you call out, voice carrying but not shouting. 
"Request to speak with Captain Marna on urgent business."
The two crew members freeze mid-task. The one coiling rope-a wiry man 
with weathered skin-straightens and studies you carefully. The other, a 
younger woman with her hair tied back, moves subtly closer to a belaying pin 
that could serve as a weapon.
"Bit late for business calls," the man says, voice neutral but wary. "State your 
purpose."
Before you can respond, a new voice cuts through the night air.
"Finn, let them speak."
 
CAPTAIN MARNA
A woman emerges from the cabin-mid-forties as Garrett described, with iron-
gray hair in a practical braid and the kind of weathered face that comes from 
decades at sea. She's wearing a practical leather vest over a work shirt, and 
there's a cutlass at her belt that looks well-used.
Captain Marna studies you both with sharp, assessing eyes. She takes in your 
gear, your bearing, the dried blood on your clothes that you haven't had time 
to clean.
"You're not dock workers," she observes. "And you're not Dragon Army-they 
don't ask politely." Her gaze sharpens. "But you've seen violence tonight. 
Recently."
She crosses her arms. "I'm Captain Marna. This is my ship. You have thirty 
seconds to convince me why I should hear what you're selling at this hour 
instead of having Finn and Sera throw you in the harbor."
 
YOUR PITCH
Persuasion Check Required
You need to convince her to:
1.	Listen to your proposal
2.	Risk her ship and crew
3.	Accept payment for smuggling refugees
Approach options:
*	Lead with the money (90 gold upfront)
*	Lead with the cause (refugees from Verminaard's slave operation)
*	Lead with local connections (Garrett and others know her crew)
*	Combination approach
How do you make your pitch?
I'll need you to frame your argument, and then I'll roll Persuasion with any 
applicable modifiers based on your approach.
Local connections. Garrick and the others led us to some goods that need 
proper shipping by a professional crew who could handle themselves. They 
suggested I visit you. We have enough coin to make it worth your time, 
though not so much as to cause you to question our business interests.
Dec 5
THE NEGOTIATION
YOUR PITCH
You keep your voice calm, professional-one businessperson to another.
"Garrett, Finn, Cole, and their friends suggested we find you. They said you're 
a professional captain who can handle delicate cargo and knows how to be 
discreet."
Marna's expression shifts slightly at the names-recognition, calculation.
"We have goods that need shipping to Haven. Urgently. Tonight. The cargo 
is... valuable, but sensitive. We need a captain who can handle themselves if 
complications arise, and who won't ask questions better left unasked." You 
pause. "We can pay ninety gold for your trouble. Enough to make it worth 
your time, but not so much you need to wonder about our business interests."
 
MARNA'S ASSESSMENT
Persuasion Check (Johannes): 11 + 3 = 14
Marna studies you for a long moment, then glances at Kessa. Her eyes linger 
on the new rapier at Keys' belt-the distinctive guard and pommel of Voss's 
weapon.
"Ninety gold for a night run to Haven," she says slowly. "That's three months 
of honest fishing work." She taps her fingers on her belt. "Which means either 
your 'goods' are extremely illegal, or extremely dangerous, or both."
She steps closer to the rail, voice dropping. "And Garrett's group-those boys 
have been missing for over a week. Taken in one of Verminaard's sweeps." Her 
eyes narrow. "So either you're lying about knowing them, or..."
She trails off, putting pieces together. Her gaze flicks to the eastern warehouse 
district, then back to you.
"Garrett, Finn, Cole, Jax, and Petyr. Five young men from Hillsford." She 
names them precisely. "What exactly is the 'cargo' we're discussing?"
 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
Marna isn't stupid, and you can see she's already halfway to the truth. Her 
hand hasn't gone to her cutlass, which is a good sign. But she wants honesty-
or at least enough of it to make an informed decision.
Finn (the crew member) speaks up: "Captain, if this is about-"
Marna raises a hand, silencing him. Her attention stays fixed on you.
"I'll ask once, plainly. Are we talking about moving Verminaard's prisoners? 
Because if we are, I need to know exactly what I'm risking my ship and crew 
for. The real number I need to hear isn't ninety gold-it's how many Dragon 
Army soldiers are going to come hunting for my head after this."
She leans on the rail. "So. Truth. What's really happening tonight?"
 
How much do you tell her?
*	Full truth (50 prisoners, dead guards, Voss eliminated, inside help)
*	Partial truth (refugees escaping, some guards dealt with, local help)
*	Deflect and focus on the money/safety (Haven is far, trail will be cold)
*	Appeal to her personal hatred of Verminaard (her husband, her losses)
Your response?
Full truth, with the argument that if the ship can be gone before the hue and 
cry rise up, there isn't any reason for the Dragon Army to be looking for 
anyone specific. Besides, we are going to stay behind to see if we can do 
something with the Captain, whatever his name is, and that should cause more 
than enough distraction if Marna can spread word of some legitimate reason 
for casting off beforehand.
Dec 5
THE FULL TRUTH
LAYING IT OUT
You meet Marna's eyes directly. "You deserve the truth if you're taking this 
risk."
You lay it out cleanly, without embellishment: Fifty prisoners in the eastern 
warehouse. Voss dead, along with six guards who won't be reporting for duty. 
Four inside men-Garrick's group-helping with the evacuation and coming 
with you. The Iron Tide arriving at dawn expecting a cargo that won't be there.
"We're staying behind to deal with Captain Drevik when his ship arrives. That 
should create more than enough chaos and distraction. If you can be gone 
before dawn-before anyone realizes what's happened-there's no reason for 
the Dragon Army to come looking for you specifically. Just another fishing 
sloop that happened to cast off early."
You pause, then add: "If you need a cover story, spread word you're heading 
out for the northern fishing grounds. Early departure to catch the dawn 
currents. Legitimate business that no one will question until it's too late to 
matter."
 
MARNA'S REACTION
Insight Check (Johannes): 8 + 1 = 9
You can't quite read her expression-it's stone, carved from years of hard 
decisions at sea.
The silence stretches. Finn and Sera have stopped even pretending to work, 
watching their captain.
Then Marna laughs-short, sharp, almost bitter.
"Fifty prisoners. Voss in the harbor, I'm guessing, judging by your wet boots 
and that smell of brine." She shakes her head. "You're either the bravest 
people I've met or the most foolish. Possibly both."
She turns to Finn. "Wake the crew. All of them. Tell them we're making an 
emergency run to the northern grounds-predawn departure to catch the 
currents." Her voice carries command authority. "Full provisions, prepare for 
passengers. Move."
Finn grins and disappears below deck.
Marna turns back to you. "Here's how this works. You have one hour-one-to 
get your people to my ship. I don't care how you do it, but they come quiet, 
they come orderly, and they come fast. We cast off the moment the last person 
boards, not a minute later."
 
THE TERMS
She counts on her fingers: "Ninety gold, paid upfront. I take your people to 
Haven-straight run, no stops, no deviations. We arrive, they disembark, we're 
done. I don't know your names, you don't know where I go next."
Her expression hardens. "But understand this: if the Dragon Army catches us 
before we clear the harbor, I will fight. My crew will fight. And some of us will 
probably die. So whatever distraction you're planning with Captain Drevik? It 
better be spectacular."
She extends her hand across the rail. "And one more thing-those boys, 
Garrett's group. They're good kids. Their father Tomas was a friend. You make 
sure they get to Haven safe, you hear me?"
Sera (the younger crew member) adds quietly: "Captain lost her 
husband to Verminaard's press gangs. This isn't just about the coin for her."
Marna shoots Sera a look but doesn't deny it.
"So. Do we have a deal?"
 
THE AGREEMENT
Do you:
1.	Accept her terms as stated (90 gold, one hour, straight to Haven)
2.	Negotiate any modifications (timing, payment structure, destination 
options)
3.	Ask about her crew's capabilities if trouble arises
4.	Something else?
Current timeline:
*	Approximately 3-4 hours until dawn
*	Garrick gathering his group (20 minutes)
*	Prisoners being organized in warehouse
*	One hour to complete boarding
What's your response to Captain Marna?
One amendment; 90 gold straight up, but she sails to the warehouse and 
loads there, then heads out. That way, the prisoners aren't seen and no one is 
the wiser.
Dec 5
FINAL TERMS
THE AMENDMENT
"One amendment," you say, meeting her handshake firmly. "Ninety gold 
upfront as agreed, but you sail to the eastern warehouse and load there. The 
prisoners aren't seen crossing the port, no witnesses, no one the wiser. You 
dock, they board directly from the warehouse, you're gone."
Marna's eyes narrow, considering. "The eastern warehouse district. Where 
Voss runs-ran-his operation. Where the Iron Tide is expected at dawn."
She calculates: "Bold. Keeps your people hidden, minimizes exposure. But it 
also puts my ship right at the crime scene." She taps the rail, thinking. "If 
anyone sees the Gull at those docks and remembers it later..."
Sera speaks up: "Captain, if we're there and gone before dawn, while it's 
still dark? We're just another vessel moving cargo. Happens all the time. 
Nothing suspicious until after they discover the prisoners missing."
Finn returns from below deck: "Crew's rousing. We can be underway in 
twenty minutes." He looks at Marna. "The warehouse berth has deeper water 
anyway. Better for a fast departure."
 
MARNA'S DECISION
Persuasion Check (Johannes): 15 + 3 = 18
Marna drums her fingers once more, then nods decisively.
"Deal. We sail to the eastern warehouse, load your people from inside, and get 
clear before anyone's the wiser." She extends her hand again. "Ninety gold 
now, and you better have those people organized and ready. I'm not sitting at 
that dock one second longer than necessary."
You count out the gold-Voss's blood money finding a better purpose. Marna 
weighs the purse, then tosses it to Finn. "Secure that. And get us ready to sail."
She turns back to you: "We'll be at your warehouse in thirty minutes. Have 
your people at the loading dock, ready to board immediately. I want families 
together, anyone who needs help identified beforehand, and someone who can 
keep order during boarding. Fifty people trying to rush onto a ship in the dark 
is how accidents happen."
She pauses. "And whatever you're planning for Captain Drevik? Make sure it 
happens after we're gone. I don't need the Iron Tide spotting us pulling away 
from those docks."
 
THE TIMELINE
Current situation:
*	T-minus 30 minutes: Wayward Gull arrives at warehouse
*	T-minus 20 minutes: Garrick + allies arrive with gear
*	Approximately 3-4 hours until dawn: Iron Tide expected
*	Prisoners: Being organized by Mera and Garrett's group
Sera calls down from the rigging: "Captain, we're ready when you are!"
Marna nods, then looks at you one final time. "Go. Get your people ready. 
We'll handle our end."
 
RETURN TO THE WAREHOUSE
You and Kessa make your way back through the darkened port. The night is 
still quiet-the calm before the storm you're about to unleash.
As you walk, Kessa speaks quietly: "That's a good woman. She's taking a 
massive risk."
"She is," you agree.
"So what's the actual plan for Drevik? Marna's right-it needs to be 
spectacular. And it needs to keep everyone's attention on the eastern docks 
while she slips away."
 
You have roughly 30 minutes before boarding begins. What do you 
do in that time?
*	Check on prisoner organization
*	Prepare your plan for Drevik
*	Set up the warehouse for the boarding process
*	Scout the area for potential complications
*	Something else?
And what IS your plan for dealing with Captain Drevik and the Iron 
Tide?
Why spoil the moment with a plan?
Dec 5
TRUSTING THE CHAOS
KESSA'S RESPONSE
Kessa laughs-genuine, delighted. "Why spoil the moment with a plan? Gods, 
Johannes, you really do have a flair for the dramatic."
She adjusts her new rapier. "I suppose we'll know what we're doing when 
the Iron Tide arrives and opportunity presents itself. That's half the fun, isn't 
it?"
You can hear the grin in her voice even in the darkness. "Besides, the best 
chaos is spontaneous. Drevik won't see it coming because we don't know 
what's coming either."
 
RETURN TO THE WAREHOUSE
You arrive back to find organized efficiency. Mera has worked miracles.
The Scene:
The prisoners are arranged in groups near the loading dock entrance:
*	Group 1: Mobile, healthy adults who can board quickly
*	Group 2: Elderly and those needing assistance
*	Group 3: The sick and injured who'll need careful handling
Mera has even found some relatively clean cloth to make rough bandages and 
wraps for the worst injuries. People are sharing water from the guards' 
supplies, speaking in hushed, hopeful voices.
Garrett approaches: "Everyone's accounted for. Forty-seven prisoners, 
plus the four of us makes fifty-one. Tomms and Olev are here with our gear." 
He gestures to two men in guard uniforms, looking nervous but determined. 
"Rickard's still thinking it over, but... I think he'll come."
As if summoned, the grizzled guard from the gate appears in the doorway. He 
takes in the scene-freed prisoners, dead guards, the whole operation laid 
bare.
Rickard speaks quietly: "Garrick told me everything. I've been..." He 
struggles with words. "I've been telling myself I was just following orders. That 
I couldn't change anything. But looking at these people..."
He unbuckles his Dragon Army insignia and drops it on the floor. "I'm with 
you. All the way to Haven."
Garrick clasps his shoulder: "Welcome to the right side, old friend."
 
THE ARRIVAL
Twenty minutes later, exactly as promised, you hear the creak of rigging and 
the gentle splash of oars. The Wayward Gull glides silently up to the 
warehouse loading dock, her crew working with practiced efficiency.
Marna stands at the rail, surveying the scene. She spots Garrett and his 
brothers, and something in her stern expression softens slightly.
"Tomas's boys," she says quietly. "He'd be proud."
Then, louder: "All right, people. Listen carefully. Board in the groups your 
organizers have arranged. No pushing, no rushing. Families stay together. If 
you need help, say so immediately. We have a long sail ahead and I want 
everyone accounted for before we cast off."
Her crew moves like clockwork-Finn and Sera helping people aboard, 
another crew member checking them off, two more arranging people below 
deck with blankets and water.
 
THE BOARDING
The process takes twenty minutes-fast, efficient, surprisingly 
orderly.
You watch as:
*	Mera helps elderly women aboard, whispering encouragement
*	Garrett and his brothers lift those too weak to climb themselves
*	Children cling to parents, eyes wide with fear and hope
*	The sick are carried carefully to makeshift beds below deck
Rickard pauses before boarding, looking back at you: "Whatever 
you're planning to do about Drevik... make it hurt. For all of us who stood by 
too long."
Garrick is the last of the prisoners to board. He grips your hand firmly. "We'll 
spread the word in Haven. Tell them what you did here. People need to know 
that Verminaard can be beaten."
 
DEPARTURE
Marna does a final count, nods to Finn, and gives the order. "Cast off. Set 
course for Haven, full sail once we clear the harbor."
The Wayward Gull slips away from the dock like a ghost, her dark sails barely 
visible against the night sky. Within minutes, she's merged with the other 
vessels in the harbor-just another ship moving in the darkness.
Current Status:
*	Fifty-one people evacuated safely
*	Warehouse now empty except for dead guards and you two
*	Approximately 2-3 hours until dawn
*	Iron Tide expected at first light
*	No alarm raised yet
 
THE CALM
Kessa stands beside you on the empty dock, watching the Gull disappear into 
the darkness.
"Well," she says. "That's the rescue done. Now comes the fun part."
She turns to look at the warehouse, then toward the eastern dock where 
the Iron Tide will arrive. "We've got a few hours. Should we prepare the 
welcome for Captain Drevik? Or do you want to rest first? You've got..." She 
checks, "both spell slots still, Hex available, and we're uninjured."
The night is yours. What do you do with the remaining hours 
before dawn?
Actually, can I retcon a few things before the ship actually left?
Dec 5
RETCON CHECKPOINT
Absolutely! Let's roll back to just before the Wayward Gull departs.
Current Scene: The boarding is complete or nearly complete. Prisoners are 
organized and ready, Marna's crew is efficient, but the ship hasn't cast off yet.
What would you like to change or add?
Some possibilities:
*	Conversation with specific prisoners before they leave
*	Instructions or messages for Garrick's group
*	Securing additional supplies or intel from the warehouse
*	Setting something up in the warehouse for later
*	Checking Voss's office for more information
*	Something else entirely?
What did you want to adjust?
Are there any flammable items in the warehouse that could be used as 
distractions while we try and deal with the Captain?
Dec 5
WAREHOUSE ASSESSMENT
SEARCHING FOR COMBUSTIBLES
Good thinking. Before the Gull departs, you and Kessa do a quick survey of the 
warehouse's contents.
Perception Check (Johannes): 14 + 1 = 15 Perception Check 
(Kessa): 18 + 4 = 22
Kessa's eyes light up as she catalogs the possibilities:
 
FLAMMABLE MATERIALS FOUND
Lamp Oil Storage:
*	6 large barrels of lamp oil (for warehouse lighting)
*	Multiple smaller jugs and containers
*	Highly flammable, burns hot and spreads quickly
Tar and Pitch:
*	3 barrels of tar (for ship maintenance/waterproofing)
*	Burns slowly but intensely, hard to extinguish
*	Creates thick black smoke
Rope and Canvas:
*	Coils of hemp rope throughout
*	Stacked canvas tarps and sailcloth
*	Dry, catches fire easily
Wooden Crates and Pallets:
*	Dozens of empty crates (very dry wood)
*	Stacked pallets everywhere
*	Perfect kindling
Alcohol Spirits:
*	In Voss's office: 2 bottles of high-proof spirits
*	Desk drawers with paperwork (excellent tinder)
Gunpowder/Alchemical:
*	Small chest in locked storage: Alchemist's fire (2 flasks)
*	Blasting powder (1 small keg - likely for construction/demolition work)
 
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT
"Oh, we can work with this," she says with a wicked grin. "We could set up 
multiple fire points, chain reactions, controlled burns... or just blow the whole 
damned place sky high if we wanted."
She walks through the space, pointing. "Lamp oil here and here for quick 
ignition. Tar barrels near support beams for structural damage. That blasting 
powder..." She whistles. "That's the centerpiece. Place it right, and we could 
collapse part of the warehouse, or create one hell of a distraction."
She considers: "Question is, what are we actually trying to accomplish with 
Drevik? Do we want to:
1.	Destroy the warehouse entirely - sends a message, eliminates 
Dragon Army infrastructure
2.	Create a massive distraction - draw guards away while we deal with 
Drevik directly
3.	Trap Drevik in a burning building - poetic, though risky
4.	Stage it for delayed detonation - we're long gone when it blows
5.	Something more surgical - just enough chaos to create opportunity
What's your vision here?"
 
Also, Marna is waiting to cast off. Do you want to:
*	Send the ship off now and then set up your fire trap
*	Set up the trap first, then send the ship (takes maybe 20-30 minutes)
*	Keep it simple and set up quickly (10 minutes, basic setup)
What's your approach?
Or other goodies nearby that might prove useful? Marna and the crew can go; 
I just want intel that eliminates the need for rolled searches.
Dec 5
COMPLETE WAREHOUSE 
INVENTORY
FULL SURVEY
You wave Marna off-she nods and gives the order to cast off. The Wayward 
Gull slips silently into the darkness as you and Kessa conduct a thorough 
inventory of everything useful.

KESSA'S SUMMARY
"So we've got military-grade smoke bombs, alchemist's fire, blasting powder, 
acid flasks, and enough flammable material to burn down half the dock 
district. Plus disguise materials, forged documents capability, weapons, and a 
small fortune in gold and blackmail material."
She grins. "We could do a lot with this. Create diversions, set traps, forge 
orders, impersonate officials, fund operations in Haven... the possibilities are 
endless."
She taps the map of supply routes. "This could be valuable intelligence. 
And those letters implicating other officials? That's leverage."
 
THE SETUP
You now have approximately 2-3 hours until dawn and the Iron Tide's arrival.
What's your plan?
With all these resources at your disposal, how do you want to prepare for 
Captain Drevik's arrival? Any specific traps, distractions, or scenarios you 
want to set up?
Would Kressa have enough time and skill to help me try and impersonate 
Voss, even from a distance, something that would convince the slave captain 
to leave the ship and let Kressa slip aboard with the Manta cloak and stow the 
explosives?
Dec 5
THE DECEPTION PLAN
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT
Kessa examines Voss's clothing, the disguise kit, and studies you critically.
"Let me think this through..."
Physical Match:
*	Voss was roughly your height and build (you killed him, so you know)
*	His clothes fit you reasonably well
*	Dawn lighting is dim - helps with distance deception
*	You'd be calling from the dock, Drevik viewing from ship deck (30-50 
feet minimum)
Kessa's Disguise Kit Check: 16 + 5 (Deception) = 21
"I can make this work," she says confidently. "Not close-up scrutiny, but from 
ship-to-dock distance in early dawn light? Absolutely."
She lays out what she needs:
 
THE DISGUISE PROCESS (30-40 minutes)
Clothing:
*	Voss's outfit: Fine coat, Harbor Master's insignia, boots
*	His distinctive hat (you recovered from the body)
*	His mannerisms: Kessa coaches you on his posture, voice patterns
Makeup/Alterations:
*	Darkening your beard to match Voss's coloring
*	False facial hair pieces from disguise kit to match his style
*	Adjusting your hair
*	Theatrical makeup for facial structure (subtle from distance)
Props:
*	Voss's ledger (visible authenticity)
*	His bronze medallion worn openly
*	His mannerisms: clipboard carrier, impatient gestures
Kessa's Training Session: "Voss was officious. Impatient. Always counted 
his coin carefully. Spoke like a man used to being obeyed by lesser people. 
From what the guards said, he talked down to Drevik - thought himself 
superior for being land-based command."
 
THE VOICE
Performance Check (Johannes with Kessa's coaching):
This would require a roll when you actually attempt it, but Kessa's assessment: 
"Your natural voice is close enough in register. Key is the attitude - 
bureaucratic annoyance, penny-pinching precision. I can coach you through 
phrases Voss would use."
She suggests practicing:
*	"Captain Drevik, we have complications with the manifest."
*	"The Harbor Master requires your signature on revised 
documentation."
*	"I need you ashore immediately to resolve a customs discrepancy."
 
KESSA'S INFILTRATION PLAN
"While you're keeping Drevik's attention dockside, I swim under the Iron 
Tide using the Manta Ray Cloak. The crew will be focused on whatever you're 
saying, maybe preparing to offload cargo or receive prisoners they think are 
coming."
Her approach:
1.	Swim underneath in darkness (pre-dawn, still dark)
2.	Surface at the stern, climb aboard quietly (sailors watching bow/dock)
3.	Place blasting powder in ship's hold or powder magazine if they have 
one
4.	Set delayed fuse using oil-soaked rope (gives us 10-15 minutes to clear)
5.	Slip back overboard before anyone notices
She considers: "Question is - do we want to:
*	Sink the Iron Tide - destroys their transport capacity, but crew might 
escape
*	Trap Drevik aboard - wait until he returns to ship, then blow it
*	Create harbor chaos - explosion draws every guard, we slip away in 
confusion
*	Capture the ship intact - more complex, but gives resistance a vessel
What's the goal here? Maximum damage to Verminaard's operation? Kill 
Drevik specifically? Send a message? Something else?"
 
TIMING CONSIDERATIONS
Dawn arrival means:
*	Still dim light (helps disguise)
*	Harbor waking up (more potential witnesses)
*	Guard change happening (confusion/opportunity)
*	Garrick's allies might still be creating their distraction
Current assets:
*	Small keg of blasting powder
*	Alchemist's fire (2 flasks)
*	Smoke bombs (3)
*	Your spell slots (2/2)
*	Hex available
 
What's your objective with Captain Drevik and the Iron Tide?
And do you want Kessa to spend the next 30-40 minutes disguising you as 
Voss?
Before we begin, what are Kressa's thoughts?
Dec 5
KESSA'S COUNSEL
A MOMENT OF REFLECTION
Kessa sets down the disguise kit and looks at you seriously. The playful edge 
that usually colors her voice is absent.
"Before we commit to this, let me say what I'm thinking."
She paces, organizing her thoughts.
 
THE TACTICAL PERSPECTIVE
"The disguise will work-probably. From distance, in dim light, with 
confidence? Yeah. But it's not foolproof. If Drevik gets suspicious, if he's heard 
Voss is missing, if he asks questions we haven't anticipated... it could go 
sideways fast."
"The ship infiltration is doable. I've done riskier. The Manta Cloak is 
perfect for it. But once I'm aboard with explosives, I'm committed. If things go 
wrong with your impersonation while I'm below deck rigging powder kegs, 
we're both in trouble."
She sits on a crate, weighing options.
 
THE STRATEGIC PERSPECTIVE
"Here's what we've actually accomplished tonight: Freed fifty people. 
Killed Voss and dismantled his operation. Got four of his guards to defect. 
Stole his money and intelligence. Verminaard's slave pipeline through 
Saltmere is broken."
"That's a massive victory, Johannes. Real damage to his operations."
She gestures toward the harbor. "The Iron Tide arriving to find 
everything gone? That's already humiliating for them. Drevik reports back 
that the entire shipment vanished, Harbor Master is dead, guards are 
missing... Verminaard loses face, loses revenue, loses momentum."
 
THE RISK ASSESSMENT
"But if we try to take out Drevik too?"
She counts on her fingers:
"Best case: We sink his ship, kill him, and escape clean. Maximum damage, 
maximum message. Verminaard learns his people aren't safe anywhere.
Likely case: We damage the ship, maybe kill Drevik, but things get messy. 
Fighting, chasing, possibly getting trapped. We're good, but we're two people 
against a ship's crew plus however many guards respond to explosions in the 
harbor.
Worst case: The disguise fails, I'm trapped on the ship, and we're fighting 
our way out against overwhelming numbers while dawn breaks and the whole 
port wakes up."
 
THE PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE
She meets your eyes. "I'll follow your lead. You know that. If you say 
we're doing this, I'm with you. I trust your instincts."
"But I also know..." She pauses, choosing words carefully. "Your patron is 
always there, isn't it? The pressure to accomplish more, take more 
risks, claim bigger victories. And sometimes that pressure can make us 
choose the spectacular over the smart."
"We came here to rescue prisoners. We did that-better than I 
dreamed possible. Do we need to prove something else? Or is it enough 
that fifty-one people are sailing to freedom right now because of what we did?"
 
THE QUESTION
She spreads her hands. "So here's what I'm really asking: Are we doing 
this because it's the right tactical move that furthers our goals? Or are we 
doing it because it feels like we should go bigger?"
"**If you believe Drevik needs to die tonight-**that killing him accomplishes 
something essential-then let's do it right. I'll help you become Voss, I'll plant 
those explosives, and we'll send that bastard to the bottom of the harbor."
"**But if there's any part of you that's doing this because you feel like 
you should-**because bigger is always better, because your patron demands 
spectacle-then maybe we should consider that we've already won tonight. We 
could take Voss's intelligence, his gold, his blackmail material, and disappear. 
Live to fight another day when the odds are better."
She stands, waiting.
"What does Johannes think? Not the Warlock, not the cursed 
soldier-you. What do you think is right?"
 
What's your answer?
She's right about Drevik. KIlling him is just simple vengeance, and I don't get 
to throw that in the boys' faces, then ignore that advice myself. But, there is 
something we can do. If we stage it right, one of us on lookout and one in the 
warehouse, when the Iron Tide is sighted on the horizon, we should have a 
good estimate of when they would be drawing near to the warehouse. We 
could time the explosives to go off right as the Iron Tide arrives. Not to harm 
anyone, but for the shock value of the place going up just as they are getting 
ready to dock. We have more than enough time to get out of town without 
making ourselves noticable, and the confusion of the explosion makes it all 
the easier to cover our tracks. In fact, we can also take Rickard's gear, and 
whatever else is left and set it up to look like Garrick and his friends were 
caught in the blast, making it that much easier to cover their escape.
Dec 5
THE BETTER PLAN
KESSA'S REACTION
Her face breaks into a genuine smile-relief mixed with approval.
"Now that's thinking clearly." She nods with satisfaction. "Vengeance for 
its own sake is just... noise. But psychological warfare? Strategic destruction? 
Theater that serves a purpose? That's worth doing."
She starts pacing, energized by the plan.
 
REFINING THE APPROACH
"Here's what that accomplishes:
One: Drevik and his crew arrive expecting routine business. Instead they get a 
warehouse exploding in their faces-no prisoners, no Harbor Master, no 
contact, just fire and chaos. That's terrifying. They'll spend hours trying to 
figure out what happened.
Two: We stage it to look like the inside men-Garrick's group-were caught in 
some kind of accident or internal conflict. Leave their guard uniforms, their 
gear, burn the bodies beyond recognition if we can find some corpses, or just 
leave evidence suggesting they died in the blast. Dragon Army writes them off 
as casualties, not defectors.
Three: By the time anyone pieces together what actually happened, we're 
long gone. The trail is cold. Garrick and his people are safely in Haven under 
new identities.
Four: We destroy the warehouse, all of Voss's records of other officials 
involved in the slave trade-burning the evidence protects those blackmail 
victims, ironically. Clean slate.
Five: We take the intelligence that we want-the supply route maps, the 
letters about operations expansion, anything useful-and leave the rest to 
burn."
 
THE STAGING
Kessa gets practical, thinking out loud:
"For the fake deaths, we need:
*	Garrick's uniform and gear (we have Rickard's, need to get the others)
*	Bodies to char beyond recognition (we have six dead guards-perfect)
*	Arrange them near the blast center so they're identifiable as 'guard 
casualties'
*	Personal effects scattered around to suggest they were present
For the explosion timing:
*	Lookout position with clear sight line to harbor entrance
*	Fuse calculation: oil-soaked rope burns about 1 foot per minute
*	We need maybe 15-20 minutes from sighting Iron Tide to detonation
*	Means a 15-20 foot fuse from the blasting powder
For maximum effect:
*	Place the keg near support beams-structural collapse
*	Stage lamp oil barrels around it for spread
*	Alchemist's fire near Voss's office-consume the records
*	Smoke bombs for visual drama (black smoke pillar visible across the 
port)
For our escape:
*	We're in position, watching from a distance
*	Explosion goes off right as Iron Tide approaches
*	In the chaos, we walk away calmly-just two dock workers surprised by 
the blast
*	Slip out of Saltmere while every guard rushes toward the fire"
 
KESSA'S FINAL THOUGHT
"This is smart, Johannes. We're not throwing ourselves at unnecessary 
risk. We're not killing for the sake of killing. We're sending a message, 
covering our allies' tracks, and walking away clean."
She grins. "And honestly? The look on Drevik's face when his 
'routine pickup' turns into a smoking crater? That's worth more 
than killing him. He'll spend the rest of his life wondering what the 
hell happened, looking over his shoulder, never feeling safe. That's 
better than a quick death."
 
THE WORK AHEAD
"So here's the timeline:
Next 30-40 minutes:
*	Gather the gear we're taking (gold, intelligence, useful supplies)
*	Stage the 'dead guards' with their personal effects
*	Rig the explosives with proper fusing
*	Set up the secondary fires (oil, alchemist's fire, smoke bombs)
2-3 hours until dawn:
*	Take position at lookout point
*	Watch for Iron Tide on horizon
*	Light the fuse when we estimate proper timing
*	Walk away calmly
As ship arrives:
*	Warehouse explodes spectacularly
*	Chaos erupts across the docks
*	We're already blocks away, heading out of town
*	Verminaard's people find a destroyed operation and 'dead' guards"
She extends her hand. "Partners?"
 
Do you want to proceed with this plan? And is there anything 
specific you want to:
*	Take with you (beyond gold and intelligence)?
*	Stage specifically for the 'accident' scene?
*	Modify about the explosive setup?
This feels like a much smarter endgame than a direct confrontation.
ONe more thought. Voss is gone, but his estate isn't. What if we were to set 
off the explosion now, starting fires that could hit nearby buildings and create 
serious disruption, then look around at the good Harbor Master's home and 
collect some of his ill-gotten gains. We lose the chance to scare the hell out of 
the captain, but we can get some loot that helps in the coming resistance 
effort?
Dec 5
THE REVISED CALCULATION
KESSA'S CONSIDERATION
She pauses mid-handshake, thinking it through.
"Two different approaches, both have merit. Let me think out 
loud:"
 
OPTION A: IMMEDIATE EXPLOSION + ESTATE 
RAID
Pros:
*	Major chaos now creates perfect cover for looting Voss's estate
*	Every guard rushes to the docks, leaving residential areas undefended
*	Fire spreading to adjacent warehouses = bigger disruption to Dragon 
Army logistics
*	We get more loot/resources for the resistance
*	Leaves town before dawn, maximum head start before pursuit
*	Still stages the "dead guards" narrative
Cons:
*	We lose the psychological impact on Drevik specifically
*	No guarantee fires spread effectively (stone warehouses, water nearby)
*	Might harm innocent dock workers/nearby residents if fire spreads 
wrong
*	We're guessing where Voss's estate is and what's there
 
OPTION B: TIMED EXPLOSION AT DAWN
Pros:
*	Maximum psychological warfare on Drevik and crew
*	Precise timing means controlled destruction
*	We know exactly when/where we need to be
*	Don't risk civilian casualties from uncontrolled fires
*	The story of the explosion reaching Haven helps recruitment
Cons:
*	Less time to loot Voss's estate (though we could still do it)
*	Smaller window for escape before dawn
*	We're making assumptions about Iron Tide's arrival time
 
KESSA'S INSIGHT
"Here's what I'm thinking: What if we don't have to choose?"
She lays it out: "Voss's estate is probably in the merchant district-nicer part 
of town, away from the docks. That's maybe... 15-20 minute walk? We could:
1. Rig the warehouse now with a long fuse (2-3 hour burn) 2. Go raid Voss's 
estate while the docks are still quiet 3. Get back to observation point before 
dawn 4. Watch the Iron Tide arrive 5. The warehouse explodes on schedule 
(we just timed it, not triggered it) 6. Walk away in the chaos
We get the loot and the psychological warfare."
She pauses. "But there's a risk: If anyone discovers the warehouse situation 
early-before we're back from the estate-our fuse is already burning and we 
can't adjust timing. We'd be committed."
 
THE ESTATE QUESTION
"Do we even know where Voss lived?" Kessa asks practically. "And what 
makes you think his best stuff is at home rather than in that locked cabinet we 
already looted?"
She gestures to the 120 gold and gemstones. "We've already got his 
operational stash. His home might have:
*	Personal wealth (more gold, jewelry, art)
*	Better intelligence (personal correspondence, maps)
*	Blackmail material on more officials
*	Possibly magical items he kept private
*	Documents about his connections
Or it might just be a nice house with furniture and his clothes. We don't 
know."
 
KESSA'S HONEST ASSESSMENT
"Look, I'm not saying don't loot the estate. I'm saying we should 
think about:
One: Do we know where it is? (Can find out from the guard station 
schedules-they list addresses)
Two: What's the actual expected value vs. risk? Breaking into a dead Harbor 
Master's house in a city on alert...
Three: Does it serve our actual goals? We need funds for Haven, yes. But 
we've got 210 gold plus gemstones already. Is the additional loot worth the 
additional exposure?
Four: Time management. We've got maybe 2-3 hours until dawn. Rigging 
explosives properly takes time. Looting an estate takes time. We can probably 
do both, but it's tight."
 
THE QUESTION
She looks at you seriously. "What's driving this decision, Johannes? Is 
it:
*	Practical need? We genuinely need more resources for Haven and the 
estate likely has significant wealth?
*	Thoroughness? We're already here, might as well take everything we 
can?
*	The curse? Your patron expecting maximum acquisition from every 
opportunity?
*	Something else?"
"Because here's my gut: We've had an incredibly successful night. We've 
won. Sometimes the smart move is to take the win and not push our luck."
She spreads her hands. "But I'll follow your lead. If you think the 
estate is worth it, let's find out where it is and go get it. Just want to 
make sure we're choosing with clear heads."
 
What's your call?
*	Rig warehouse now, raid estate, timed explosion at dawn?
*	Rig warehouse for immediate explosion, raid estate in the chaos?
*	Skip the estate, focus on the timed explosion plan?
*	Something else entirely?
And honestly-what IS driving this decision?
Considering that rapier you're carrying, I can almost guarantee Voss has more. 
And if he's up to his eyeballs with Verminaard, you can bet he has been 
stashing away more than he spends...just in case things go south. Remember, 
he is a cold, cruel beast. Let's take him for everything we can.
Dec 5
THE ESTATE RAID
KESSA'S GRIN
"Now you're talking sense." She hefts the magical rapier. "You're right-
this wasn't just lying around in his office. A man like Voss, playing both sides, 
skimming from Verminaard, blackmailing officials? He's absolutely got a 
private stash. The 'run money' every corrupt official keeps ready."
She's energized now, thinking it through. "Cold, cruel beasts don't trust 
banks or Dragon Army accounting. They hide wealth where only 
they can get it. And Voss? He struck me as the paranoid type. The kind 
who has contingencies."
 
FINDING THE ADDRESS
You head to the guard station. The shift schedule board has what you need:
Harbor Master Voss - Residence: 23 Merchant's Row, Upper District
Kessa whistles. "Merchant's Row. That's serious money. Those are the 
houses with gates, gardens, private security sometimes. He wasn't just 
corrupt-he was successful at being corrupt."
 
THE PLAN
"Here's how we do this smart:"
Phase 1 - Rig the Warehouse (30-40 minutes):
*	Set explosives with long fuse (2.5 hour burn, timed for dawn)
*	Stage the "dead guards" scene with bodies and gear
*	Take what we're keeping (intelligence, maps, useful supplies)
*	Lock it up, make it look undisturbed from outside
Phase 2 - Estate Raid (45-60 minutes):
*	Travel to Merchant's Row (~20 minutes)
*	Break in quietly (Kessa's specialty)
*	Find Voss's stash
*	Get out clean
Phase 3 - Observation & Exit (remaining time until dawn):
*	Position to watch Iron Tide arrive
*	Warehouse explodes on schedule
*	Walk away in chaos
Total time needed: ~2.5-3 hours. We're cutting it close but it's doable.
 
RIGGING THE WAREHOUSE
You get to work with practiced efficiency.
The Explosive Setup:
Kessa does the calculations: "2.5 hours from now puts us right at dawn. 
Oil-soaked rope burns about 1 foot per minute, so we need..." She 
measures out rope. "150 feet of fuse, coiled properly, leading to the 
blasting powder keg."
You position the keg beneath a primary support beam, surrounded by:
*	Lamp oil barrels (for spread and intensity)
*	Tar barrels (for thick smoke and prolonged burn)
*	Wooden crates (kindling to ensure ignition)
*	Alchemist's fire flask positioned to break from heat (secondary ignition)
*	Smoke bombs near Voss's office (maximum visual effect)
The Staging:
You arrange the six dead guards' bodies:
*	Three near the blast center (will be obliterated)
*	Two in the cells area (crushed by falling debris)
*	One near the loading dock (attempt to escape the "accident")
Kessa scatters their personal effects:
*	Rickard's letter from his wife (heartbreaking touch)
*	Personal weapons, dice, coin pouches
*	Guard schedules showing they were on duty
*	Makes it look like a tragic accident during normal operations
 
LIGHTING THE FUSE
Intelligence Check (Kessa for fuse timing): 18 + 3 = 21
"Perfect." She lights the end, watching it catch. The rope begins its slow, 
steady burn-invisible once it enters the coils she's arranged. "Two and a 
half hours. We'll be watching from across the harbor when this 
goes up."
You take one last look at the warehouse. Everything you're leaving behind:
*	Dragon Army supplies
*	Prison cells
*	Voss's corrupted operation
Everything you're taking:
*	210 gold + gemstones (50 gold value)
*	Maps of supply routes
*	Letters about operation expansion
*	Blackmail material on other officials
*	Healing potions, antitoxin
*	Voss's seal for forgery
*	Useful alchemy (remaining smoke bombs, acid flasks)
 
TO MERCHANT'S ROW
The night is deep now-darkest before dawn. Your Devil's Sight makes 
navigating the quiet streets easy. Kessa moves beside you like a shadow.
Saltmere's Upper District is a different world from the docks:
*	Cobblestone streets (not dirt and mud)
*	Gas lamps (not torches)
*	Walled gardens and iron gates
*	Houses with multiple stories and real glass windows
23 Merchant's Row stands out even here:
*	Three-story townhouse, stone construction
*	Wrought iron fence with locked gate
*	Manicured garden (someone tends this regularly)
*	Heavy front door with quality lock
*	Windows on ground floor have shutters (closed)
*	Servants' entrance around back
Perception Check (Johannes): 12 + 1 = 13 Perception Check 
(Kessa): 19 + 4 = 23
Kessa grabs your arm, pulling you into shadow. "Two things: One, there's a 
light on in a third-floor window. Someone's home-servant, maybe? Voss's 
wife or family?
Two, there's a ward on the front door. See the faint shimmer? Magical alarm, 
probably. If we go through the front, someone gets alerted."
She points. "Servants' entrance around back is probably less 
protected. Or we could go through a window. Your call on 
approach."
 
How do you want to break in?
*	Servants' entrance (likely less warded, but might have staff)
*	Window entry (risky but direct)
*	Front door (trigger ward but fastest route)
*	Other creative approach?
And what about that light on the third floor? Handle it, avoid it, or 
investigate?
None of the above. Let's see if we can scale to the second or third floor, where 
the odds of magical wards decreases.
Dec 5
SCALING THE TOWNHOUSE
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT
"Clever." She studies the building's exterior. "Ground floor is where you ward 
against common thieves. Upper floors? People get lazy, assume the height is 
protection enough."
She points out the architecture: "Three-story stone construction. Let's 
see what we've got to work with..."
 
CLIMBING OPTIONS
Perception Check (Kessa - looking for routes): 17 + 4 = 21
"Good news: This place was built for show, not security. Look-"
She indicates several features:
Option 1 - Decorative Stonework:
*	Ornamental ledges between floors
*	Carved stone details that provide handholds
*	Rainwater drainage pipes (iron, sturdy)
*	Target: Second floor window on the side (shutters, but no visible 
wards)
Option 2 - Garden Trellis:
*	Sturdy wooden trellis with climbing roses
*	Leads to second-floor balcony (east side)
*	Balcony has glass doors (easier to pick than windows)
*	Risk: Trellis might creak, roses have thorns
Option 3 - Drainage System:
*	Iron downspout from roof
*	Runs along back corner
*	Could reach third-floor windows
*	Consideration: That's where the light is on-might encounter 
whoever's awake
 
KESSA'S RECOMMENDATION
"I'd say second floor, side window. Good handholds, dark side of the 
house, away from that third-floor light. We get in, search the second floor 
first-that's likely where Voss kept his private study or bedroom. Master 
bedroom suites are usually second floor in houses like this."
She tests the stonework with her fingers. "Solid. I can climb this easy. 
You..." She eyes your armor and build. "You're heavier and less 
practiced, but with your strength? Should be fine. Athletics check, 
DC probably 12 or so."
 
THE CLIMB
Do you want to:
1.	Both climb to second-floor side window (your suggested 
approach)
2.	Kessa climbs, drops you a rope from inside (safer for you, but 
takes longer)
3.	Try a different floor/approach
And for the actual climb:
Athletics check (DC 12) - you've got decent Strength Kessa will go first to scout 
and can give you guidance
Also: Do you want to do anything about that third-floor light?
*	Ignore it (hope they don't notice)
*	Watch it while climbing (make sure no one's looking out)
*	Have Kessa create a distraction elsewhere first
*	Something else
What's your approach?
1.	And we can use the rope of entanglement to help in the climb?
Dec 5
THE ASCENT
USING THE ROPE
"Smart thinking." Kessa pulls out the Rope of Entanglement. "It's magical, 
so it should hold our weight easily. And it can animate to help..."
She examines the second-floor window. "Here's what we do: I tie it off to 
something secure up there-the window frame, a balcony rail, whatever I find. 
You keep one end. When I signal, the rope can help pull you up while you 
climb. Makes it much easier."
 
KESSA'S CLIMB
She moves like a spider-finding handholds in the decorative stonework, using 
the drainage pipe for support, barely making a sound.
Kessa's Athletics Check: 14 + 2 = 16 (easy success)
Within moments, she's at the second-floor window. She tests the shutters-
unlocked, just latched from inside. A quick application of a thin blade and they 
swing open silently.
She peers inside, then gives you a thumbs up. The room is dark and empty.
Kessa secures the rope to the window frame, then lowers the other end 
down to you. The magical rope seems to understand its purpose, stiffening 
slightly to provide better support.
She signals: Ready when you are.
 
JOHANNES'S CLIMB
You grip the rope and begin ascending. The stonework provides footholds, the 
rope assists when you need it, and your strength does the rest.
Athletics Check (Johannes with rope assistance - DC reduced to 8):
Rolling... 7 + 3 = 10 ?
It's not graceful, but it's effective. You find handholds in the carved stone, use 
the drainage pipe for leverage, and let the rope take some of your weight when 
needed. The decorative architecture that makes the house look impressive also 
makes it surprisingly climbable.
Within a minute, you're pulling yourself through the second-floor window into 
darkness.
 
INSIDE VOSS'S TOWNHOUSE
The Room:
Your Devil's Sight reveals a guest bedroom:
*	Expensive furniture, barely used
*	Dust covers on some pieces
*	Closed door leading to hallway
*	Everything neat, sterile, for show rather than living
Perception Check (passive - Kessa): 18
Kessa points to the door, putting finger to her lips. You both hear it:
Footsteps. Third floor. Someone walking around.
Not urgent, just... moving. Maybe someone who can't sleep. Maybe a servant 
doing late-night tasks.
Kessa whispers barely audibly: "Second floor should be master suite, 
study, maybe a sitting room. Third floor is probably servants' quarters or 
children's rooms. We want Voss's private spaces-second floor."
She gestures to the hallway door. "Ready to search? And what do we do 
if we encounter whoever's up there?"
 
THE SEARCH BEGINS
You're inside. Options:
1.	Systematic search of second floor (methodical, thorough)
2.	Quick search for obvious valuables (faster, might miss things)
3.	Look for a study/office first (intelligence over gold)
4.	Find the master bedroom (personal items, hidden safes)
And regarding the third-floor occupant:
*	Avoid them entirely (stay quiet)
*	Subdue if encountered (Sleep spell, non-lethal)
*	Try to identify who they are first (peek upstairs)
What's your approach?
systematic search...
Dec 5
SYSTEMATIC SEARCH - SECOND 
FLOOR
THE LAYOUT
Kessa eases the guest room door open. The hallway is carpeted (good for 
stealth), lit by a single dim lamp. Your Devil's Sight reveals:
Second Floor Hallway:
*	Master bedroom (large double doors, center)
*	Study/office (door slightly ajar, left side)
*	Sitting room (closed door, right side)
*	Bathroom (ornate door, far end)
*	Stairs up to third floor (where footsteps continue sporadically)
*	Stairs down to first floor (dark, quiet)
The footsteps above: Still moving occasionally. Sounds like someone 
pacing, restless.
 
ROOM 1: THE STUDY
You start with the most likely location for intelligence and hidden valuables. 
Kessa picks the lock silently.
Investigation Check (Johannes): 14 + 1 = 15 Investigation Check 
(Kessa): 19 + 5 = 24
STUDY CONTENTS
Voss's Desk (locked, Kessa opens it):
Top Drawer:
*	Personal correspondence from other Harbor officials
*	Love letters (Voss had a mistress-leverage if needed)
*	Bills of sale for luxury goods
*	Gambling debts from various merchants (more blackmail material)
Hidden Compartment (Kessa finds it):
*	50 platinum pieces (500 gold value!)
*	Diamond ring (100 gold value, probably the mistress's?)

*	One hollowed-out book containing: Sending Stones (pair of 
communication stones-extremely valuable!)
*	Navigation charts with hidden routes marked
*	Encoded ledger (needs time to decipher)
Wall Safe (behind portrait - Kessa's eyes light up):
"There it is." She examines the lock. "Quality work. This is where he 
kept the real treasures."
Thieves' Tools Check (Kessa): 16 + 7 = 23
Click. The safe swings open.
Safe Contents:
*	200 gold pieces (stacked neatly)
*	Potion of Greater Healing (4d4+4)
*	Cloak of Elvenkind (advantage on Stealth, carefully folded)
*	Wand of Secrets (detects secret doors/traps)
*	Contract with a devil (not YOUR patron-different entity, trade 
agreement for "protection")
*	List of Dragon Army commanders with notes: "Bribable," 
"Blackmailable," "True Believer"
Kessa stares at the haul. "You were right. He was absolutely stashing 
away 'just in case' money."
 
ROOM 2: MASTER BEDROOM
The double doors open to reveal luxury:
Investigation Check (Johannes): 9 + 1 = 10 Investigation Check 
(Kessa): 17 + 5 = 22
Obvious Valuables:
*	Silver candlesticks (20 gold value)
*	Jewelry box with women's jewelry (80 gold value-wife's or mistress's?)
*	Fine clothing (Voss dressed well)

In the wardrobe (false back):
*	Potion of Invisibility
*	Scroll of Dimension Door
*	Maps to safe houses across the region
"This man had exit strategies on top of exit strategies," Kessa 
whispers admiringly. "Paranoid bastard planned for everything."
 
ROOM 3: SITTING ROOM
Investigation Check (Johannes): 13 + 1 = 14 Investigation Check 
(Kessa): 12 + 5 = 17
Less treasure here, more personal effects:
*	Wine collection (some bottles worth 10-20 gold each)
*	Art pieces (50 gold value total, but bulky)
*	Personal letters revealing Voss's family: He has a wife (currently 
visiting relatives in a northern city) and an adult son (serving in 
Verminaard's army-ironic)
*	Cabinet of Curiosities: Minor magical trinkets
*	Eversmoking Bottle (creates fog on command)

*	Devil contract
*	Encoded ledger
*	Navigation charts with smuggling routes
*	Blackmail material on multiple officials
Total liquid wealth: ~1,030 gold equivalent
 
THE THIRD FLOOR
The footsteps have stopped. Whoever was up there seems to have settled.
Kessa looks at the haul, then at you. "Do we press our luck and check the 
third floor? Or do we take this incredible score and get out?"
She glances out the window. "We've been here maybe 30 minutes. Still 
have time before the warehouse blows, but..."
 
What do you want to do?
1.	Search third floor (might find more, might encounter occupant)
2.	Leave now with the haul (already massive success)
3.	Quick peek at first floor before leaving
4.	Something else
Time check: Warehouse fuse has about 2 hours left to burn.
Holy crap, jackpot!!
Dec 5
THE SCORE OF A LIFETIME
KESSA'S REACTION
Kessa is grinning so wide her face might split. She's carefully packing magical 
items into the two Bags of Holding, organizing everything with practiced 
efficiency.
"Johannes, this is..." She laughs quietly, almost disbelieving. "This is 
more than a score. This is a gods-damned FORTUNE."
She counts on her fingers: "Over a thousand gold in liquid assets. 
Magical items that are worth double or triple that on the black 
market-or invaluable for actual use. Intelligence that could 
cripple Dragon Army operations across the region."
She holds up the Sending Stones. "Do you know what these are worth? 
These let you communicate across ANY distance. Instant messages. 
For a resistance movement? These are PRICELESS."
Then the Cloak of Elvenkind: "Advantage on Stealth checks. For me? I'll 
be a ghost."
The Wand of Secrets: "Finds hidden doors and traps. That alone 
would have made this trip worth it."
 
THE REALITY CHECK
She sets down the bags and looks at you seriously.
"Voss wasn't just corrupt. He was preparing for the LONG game. 
Multiple exit strategies, safe houses, fake identities, enough wealth 
to disappear and live comfortably anywhere."
She taps the devil contract. "And he was hedging his bets with powers 
beyond the Dragon Army. He didn't trust Verminaard to win."
A pause. "You called it perfectly. Cold, cruel beast who trusted 
nothing and no one. Kept everything he valued close, hidden, 
protected."
 
THE QUESTION
She hefts the bags-now considerably heavier with the haul. "So. Do we:
Option 1 - Leave NOW:
*	We've hit the jackpot
*	No reason to push luck further
*	Get to observation point early
*	Watch warehouse explosion with time to spare
Option 2 - Quick Third Floor Peek:
*	Might find more (though hard to top this)
*	Risk encountering whoever's up there
*	Could be servants' quarters (minimal value)
*	Could be something unexpected
Option 3 - First Floor Before Leaving:
*	Kitchen, dining room, entry hall
*	Probably less valuable than second floor
*	Might have wine cellar, pantry goods
*	Additional risk of discovery
My vote?" Kessa says. "We leave. This is already legendary. The third 
floor occupant is probably a servant or a worried wife who doesn't 
know Voss is dead. The first floor is public spaces-nothing 
personal or valuable."
She grins. "We came. We climbed. We CONQUERED. Let's take our 
incredible haul and get out while we're ahead."
 
THE MOMENT
You're standing in Voss's master bedroom, surrounded by the wealth of a man 
who thought he was untouchable. Two Bags of Holding full of treasures that 
will fund a resistance, equip fighters, and provide invaluable tools.
In 2 hours, his warehouse operation burns to the ground.
His slaves are free.
His guards have defected.
His blackmail victims will find their secrets destroyed in the fire.
And his personal fortune? Now funding the very people fighting against 
everything he stood for.
What's your call?
*	Take the win and leave
*	Push for third floor
*	Check first floor
*	Something else
Either way, Kessa's right: this IS a jackpot.
OPtion 2. Use the cloak and check.
Dec 5
THE THIRD FLOOR
KESSA'S NOD
"Quick and quiet then." She hands you the Cloak of Elvenkind. "This is 
yours for this. Advantage on Stealth-you'll be practically 
invisible."
The cloak settles around your shoulders like shadow made cloth. It's eerily 
light, seems to drink in the ambient light around you.
"I'll stay here, pack everything properly, keep watch on the stairs." 
She draws her rapier. "If things go wrong up there, I'm right behind 
you. Signal if you need help."
 
ASCENDING TO THE THIRD FLOOR
Stealth Check (Johannes with Cloak of Elvenkind - Advantage):
*	First roll: 16 + 2 = 18
*	Second roll: 11 + 2 = 13
*	Result: 18
You move like a ghost up the carpeted stairs. The cloak seems to muffle even 
your breathing, blending you into the shadows. Your Devil's Sight reveals the 
third floor layout:
Third Floor Hallway:
*	Four smaller rooms (servants' quarters style)
*	One larger room at the end (door closed, light visible underneath)
*	Simple furnishings, much more modest than below
*	The sound of... crying?
 
THE OCCUPIED ROOM
You approach the door where light seeps out. Through the gap, you hear:
A woman's voice, soft, choked with tears: "Please, please be safe..."
Perception Check (Johannes): 15 + 1 = 16
You peek through the keyhole (easy with Devil's Sight):
Inside the room:
A young woman, early twenties, sitting at a small desk. She's dressed in 
servant's clothing but her features are refined, educated. She's writing a letter 
by candlelight, tears streaming down her face.
On the desk you can see:
*	Half-written letter: "Father, please reconsider. Verminaard's cause is-
"
*	Several crumpled attempts
*	A small portrait: Voss with this woman (his daughter?)
*	Travel bag, half-packed
She's not a servant. She's Voss's daughter, and she appears to be:
1.	Trying to write to someone (her father? But he's dead...)
2.	Packing to leave
3.	Distressed about something
 
THE OTHER ROOMS
You quietly check the other three rooms while she's occupied:
Servants' Room 1 (Empty):
*	Basic furnishings
*	Personal effects suggest the servant left recently or is away
*	Nothing valuable
Servants' Room 2 (Empty):
*	Same as room 1
*	Actually looks unused, dusty
Servants' Room 3 (Locked - Kessa's not here to pick it):
*	You could force it (noisy) or leave it
Storage Room:
*	Linens, cleaning supplies
*	Small locked chest (you could force it or leave it)
*	Household goods
 
THE SITUATION
What you know:
*	Voss's daughter is awake, emotional, packing to leave
*	She's writing letters (possibly hasn't heard about her father's death yet)
*	The servants seem to be gone or away
*	One locked room, one locked chest you haven't searched
Options:
1.	Leave now - Don't disturb her, take what you have
2.	Search the locked chest/room - Might find more valuables, but 
noisy
3.	Confront/talk to the daughter - Risky, but might gain information
4.	Wait for her to sleep, then search - Time consuming
5.	Something else
Kessa would probably say: "We've got the jackpot already. The daughter 
is a wild card-sad, grieving, unpredictable. Not worth the risk."
But you're here now. What do you do?
Could the chest fit into the bag of holding?
Dec 5
CREATIVE THINKING
SIZING IT UP
Good question. You examine the chest through the storage room doorway.
The chest is approximately:
*	2 feet long
*	1 foot wide
*	1 foot deep
*	Made of wood with iron banding
*	Has a simple lock (not magical from what you can tell)
Bag of Holding capacity: 64 cubic feet, 500 pounds
The chest is roughly 2 cubic feet and probably weighs around 30-40 
pounds (wooden construction with contents).
Answer: Yes, absolutely. It would fit easily into either Bag of Holding.
 
THE PLAY
You could simply:
1.	Pick up the entire chest
2.	Slide it into the Bag of Holding
3.	Deal with opening it later in safety
4.	No noise, no alerts, clean exit
Stealth Check to grab it without alerting the daughter:
With your Cloak of Elvenkind (Advantage on Stealth), you'd need to move 
quietly into the storage room, lift the chest, and get it into the bag.
DC probably 12 (she's distracted by crying and writing, but any loud noise 
would alert her)
 
KESSA'S WHISPER
You hear the softest whisper from the stairwell-Kessa has crept up partway to 
check on you.
She spots you eyeing the chest and grins, giving you a thumbs up. She makes a 
"lifting" gesture and points to the bag-she gets it.
Do you want to:
1.	Take the chest (Stealth check, quick and clean)
2.	Leave it (we already have a fortune)
3.	Take chest AND check the locked room (pushing luck further)
Time check: Warehouse fuse has about 1 hour 45 minutes remaining.
What's your move?
1.	Why not. We can use the eversmoking bottle if things go south, then 
escape out the window with the rope.
Dec 5
THE FINAL HEIST
THE GRAB
Smart contingency planning. You position yourself near the storage room, 
Eversmoking Bottle ready in case the daughter investigates any noise.
Stealth Check (with Cloak of Elvenkind - Advantage):
*	First roll: 14 + 2 = 16
*	Second roll: 8 + 2 = 10
*	Result: 16
You move like a shadow into the storage room. The chest is right where you 
spotted it, tucked behind some linens. You lift it carefully-heavier than 
expected, maybe 50 pounds, something substantial inside shifting slightly.
The Bag of Holding opens like a hungry mouth. You slide the chest in 
smoothly, and it vanishes into the extradimensional space.
From the daughter's room: "...and I know you believe in his cause, but 
Father, the things I've seen..."
She's still writing, still crying, completely unaware.
 
CLEAN ESCAPE
You signal Kessa. She's already got the rope ready at the second-floor window. 
You descend the stairs like a ghost-the Cloak of Elvenkind making you 
practically invisible even if the daughter had looked out her door.
Back in the guest bedroom, Kessa has everything organized:
*	Both Bags of Holding packed efficiently
*	Rope of Entanglement ready for descent
*	Window open, exit clear
"Get everything?" she whispers.
You pat the bag with the mystery chest inside.
Her grin is wicked. "Let's go."
 
THE DESCENT
Athletics Check (Johannes, with rope assistance - DC 8): Rolling... 11 
+ 3 = 14 ?
You rappel down smoothly, the magical rope making it easy. Kessa follows like 
a spider, retrieves the rope with a whispered command, and you're both on the 
ground.
The Merchant's Row is still quiet. No alarms, no witnesses, no complications.
You walk away from 23 Merchant's Row with:
*	Over 1,000 gold in liquid wealth
*	A dozen magical items
*	Invaluable intelligence
*	A mystery locked chest
*	And Voss's daughter still upstairs, crying over a letter to her father, not 
knowing he's already dead
 
HEADING TO THE OBSERVATION POINT
Time check: Approximately 1 hour 30 minutes until the warehouse 
explosion.
You make your way back toward the docks, but to a position where you can 
observe without being obvious. Kessa knows a spot-an old fisherman's 
warehouse, abandoned, with a clear view of the eastern docks.
The Setup:
You settle in to wait. From here you can see:
*	The eastern warehouse (your handiwork waiting to ignite)
*	The harbor entrance (where the Iron Tide will appear)
*	The dock approaches (where Drevik will expect to meet Voss)
*	Escape routes in multiple directions
Kessa pulls out the mystery chest. "Want to see what we got? Or save it 
for later?"
 
Do you:
1.	Open the chest now (satisfy curiosity, assess what you have)
2.	Wait until after the fireworks (stay focused on the mission)
3.	Open it once you're clear of Saltmere (maximum safety)
And how do you want to spend this waiting time?
*	Rest and recover spell slot? (short rest possible)
*	Plan your exit route in detail
*	Just watch and wait
*	Something else
What's your call?
Wait, I thought we said we'd check the locked room?
Dec 5
CORRECTION - THE LOCKED ROOM
You're absolutely right! My apologies-you said Option 2 specifically included 
checking the locked room, and I skipped over it.
 
BACK TO THE THIRD FLOOR
Let me rewind to when you were still in Voss's townhouse, after grabbing the 
chest but before leaving.
The locked servants' room is still there, unexplored. Kessa is with you now 
on the third floor, having come up when you signaled about the chest.
She eyes the locked door, then glances toward the daughter's room where soft 
crying continues.
"Want me to pick it?" she whispers. "Or we could force it if you're 
willing to risk the noise."
Options:
1.	Kessa picks the lock (Thieves' Tools check, quieter but takes a 
moment)
2.	Force the door (Athletics check, faster but noisy-might alert the 
daughter)
3.	Actually, never mind, let's leave (we have the chest, that's enough)
If the daughter investigates: You still have the Eversmoking Bottle ready 
and the rope escape plan.
Time remaining on warehouse fuse: About 1 hour 45 minutes
What do you want to do?
My bad. I should have said 3 not 1. Please feel free to reroll.
Dec 5
NO PROBLEM - CORRECTED 
CHOICE
THE CLEAN EXIT
Got it-Option 3: Take the chest and leave. No need to push luck with the 
locked room when you've already scored big.
Let me reroll that descent since we're back on track:
 
THE DESCENT (CORRECTED)
Athletics Check (Johannes, with rope assistance - DC 8): Rolling... 9 
+ 3 = 12 ?
You rappel down smoothly, the magical rope making it easy. Kessa follows like 
a spider, retrieves the rope with a whispered command, and you're both on the 
ground.
The Merchant's Row is still quiet. No alarms, no witnesses, no complications.
You walk away from 23 Merchant's Row with:
*	Over 1,000 gold in liquid wealth
*	A dozen magical items
*	Invaluable intelligence
*	A mystery locked chest
*	And Voss's daughter still upstairs, unaware her father is dead
 
HEADING TO THE OBSERVATION POINT
Time check: Approximately 1 hour 30 minutes until the warehouse 
explosion.
You make your way back toward the docks, but to a position where you can 
observe without being obvious. Kessa knows a spot-an old fisherman's 
warehouse, abandoned, with a clear view of the eastern docks.
The Setup:
You settle in to wait. From here you can see:
*	The eastern warehouse (your rigged explosives burning on their slow 
fuse)
*	The harbor entrance (where the Iron Tide will appear)
*	The dock approaches (where Drevik expects to meet Voss)
*	Multiple escape routes
Kessa pulls out the mystery chest. "Want to see what we got? Or save it 
for later?"
 
Do you:
1.	Open the chest now (satisfy curiosity)
2.	Wait until after the explosion (stay focused)
3.	Open it once clear of Saltmere (maximum safety)
And for the waiting time:
*	Short rest to recover? (you're at full health/spells, but could benefit from 
Hit Dice recovery if needed)
*	Plan detailed exit route
*	Just watch and wait
*	Something else
What's your preference?
Let's go back and get the horses, settle the tavern bill (if there is any) get some 
breakfast to go, then head back to watch the fireworks.
Dec 5
TYING UP LOOSE ENDS
BACK TO THE INN
Smart thinking-no point leaving a trail of unpaid bills and abandoned horses.
You navigate back through Saltmere's waking streets. The sky is beginning to 
lighten-not dawn yet, but pre-dawn gray. A few early risers are starting their 
day: bakers firing ovens, dock workers heading to morning shifts.
You and Kessa look like any other travelers preparing for an early departure.
 
THE SALTY DOG INN
The innkeeper is awake, tending the common room fire. He looks up as you 
enter.
"Early start, friends?" he asks amiably.
"Business calls," Kessa says with an easy smile. "We'll be heading out. 
What do we owe you?"
Innkeeper tallies: "Two rooms, two nights, stabling for two horses, and 
meals... that'll be 5 gold pieces total."
You pay him-barely a dent in your newfound fortune.
"Any chance we could get some breakfast to take with us?" you ask.
"For another silver, I can have the kitchen pack you something." He 
calls back to the kitchen. "Bread, cheese, dried meat, apples. Good 
traveling food."
Total: 5 gold, 1 silver
Within minutes you have:
*	A wrapped bundle of food
*	Your horses saddled and ready
*	Your room cleared
*	No questions asked
The innkeeper waves you off. "Safe travels! Watch yourselves on the 
roads-Dragon Army patrols have been heavy lately."
If only he knew.
 
BACK TO THE OBSERVATION POINT
You ride back toward the docks, but circle around to the abandoned 
fisherman's warehouse Kessa identified earlier. You secure the horses out of 
sight in an old stable area.
The vantage point is perfect:
*	Clear view of the eastern warehouse (about 200 yards away)
*	Clear view of harbor entrance
*	Multiple escape routes by horse
*	Covered position, won't be spotted
You settle in with the breakfast. Fresh bread, sharp cheese, cold meat. After a 
night of action, it tastes incredible.
Kessa munches an apple, watching the harbor. "Should be any minute 
now. Ships usually arrive with the dawn tide."
 
THE WAITING
Time check: Approximately 20-30 minutes until the fuse reaches the 
blasting powder.
The harbor is coming alive:
*	Dock workers arriving for morning shifts
*	A few ships preparing to depart
*	Guards changing shifts
*	Merchants opening warehouses
Everything normal. Everything routine.
No one knows what's about to happen.
 
THE HORIZON
Perception Check (Kessa): 18 + 4 = 22
"There," she points.
On the horizon, sails. A ship approaching under good wind. Too far to make 
out details yet, but the timing is right.
The Iron Tide, right on schedule.
Kessa checks a small hourglass she borrowed from the inn. "Fuse should hit 
the powder in about... fifteen minutes. Ship will be entering the 
harbor in maybe... twenty?"
She grins. "We timed this perfectly. Drevik's going to dock, expecting 
his cargo, and instead..."
 
THE FINAL MINUTES
The ship grows larger, approaching the harbor entrance. You can start to make 
out details:
*	Two-masted merchant vessel
*	Flying Dragon Army colors
*	Crew moving about on deck
*	A figure on the bridge (probably Drevik)
The eastern warehouse sits quiet, innocent. Inside, a rope burns steadily 
toward destruction.
Kessa offers you the last apple. "To absent friends," she says, mock-
toasting toward the Wayward Gull's direction. "May they reach Haven 
safely."
 
How do you want to spend these final minutes before the 
explosion?
*	Open the mystery chest while you wait?
*	Just watch and savor the moment?
*	Prepare for quick exit?
*	Something else?
The anticipation is delicious.
Prepare for a quick exit, especially with the warning of extra Dragon Army 
patrols. And plans for how to get back to Haven if we get split up for any 
reason. I know you want to open the chest, but it just seems out of character 
for what is happening.
Dec 5
PROFESSIONAL PREPARATION
KESSA'S NOD
"You're right." She sets the chest aside without hesitation. "Time for that 
later. Right now, we focus on getting out clean."
She's all business now, the playful edge replaced by tactical precision.
 
EXIT STRATEGY
The Routes:
Kessa sketches in the dirt with a stick:
"Three ways out of Saltmere from here:
Route 1 - North Road (Primary):
*	Main highway toward Haven
*	Well-maintained, fast travel
*	Risk: Most likely to have Dragon Army patrols
*	Advantage: Blend with merchant traffic
*	Our cover: Just travelers who left early
Route 2 - Coastal Path (Secondary):
*	Follows the shoreline west, then cuts north
*	Rougher terrain, slower
*	Risk: Isolated, harder to explain if stopped
*	Advantage: Less patrolled, more hiding spots
*	Our cover: Fishermen, coastal traders
Route 3 - Forest Trail (Emergency):
*	Cuts through woods southeast, loops back north
*	Longest route, roughest terrain
*	Risk: Could get lost, slower progress
*	Advantage: Almost no patrols, total concealment
*	Our cover: Hunters, foragers"
 
IF WE GET SEPARATED
Kessa's voice is serious: "If something goes wrong and we get split up:
Rally Point 1: The crossroads shrine, 10 miles north on the main road. 
There's a small temple to Mishakal-recognizable landmark. Wait there for 6 
hours.
Rally Point 2: If Rally Point 1 is compromised or you can't reach it-there's 
an abandoned mill about 15 miles northwest, off the coastal path. Old stone 
building, collapsed water wheel. Can't miss it. Wait there for 12 hours.
Rally Point 3: If both fail-just get to Haven. I'll find you there, or you find 
me. Ask at the temple district for 'Keys'-someone will know me."
She meets your eyes. "But we're not getting separated. Understood?"
 
QUICK EXIT PROTOCOL
The Plan:
"When the warehouse blows:
Phase 1 (First 60 seconds):
*	Everyone looks toward the explosion
*	We stay put, watch like curious bystanders
*	Don't move immediately (suspicious)
Phase 2 (1-3 minutes):
*	Confusion spreads, people running toward the docks
*	We mount up casually, like we're leaving to avoid trouble
*	Head north on main road with other civilians fleeing the chaos
Phase 3 (3-10 minutes):
*	Once we're outside immediate dock area, assess pursuit
*	If clean: maintain normal travel pace
*	If pursuit: switch to Route 2 or 3
Phase 4 (First hour):
*	Put distance between us and Saltmere
*	Watch for Dragon Army roadblocks
*	Be ready to go off-road if needed"
 
GEAR CHECK
Kessa inventories quickly:
Horses:
*	Saddled, rested, fed
*	Saddlebags secured
*	Ready for immediate departure
Bags of Holding:
*	All treasure secured
*	Weight distributed evenly
*	Easy access to emergency items
Combat Ready:
*	Your spell slots: 2/2
*	Her rapier loose in sheath
*	Sleep grenade accessible if needed
*	Potions ready
Identities:
*	No obvious Dragon Army connection
*	Look like merchants/travelers
*	Legitimate reason for early departure (avoiding trouble)
 
THE MOMENT
Perception Check (Johannes): 14 + 1 = 15
The Iron Tide is entering the harbor now, sails being adjusted for docking 
approach. You can see crew members preparing lines, a pilot guiding them 
toward the eastern docks.
Toward the warehouse.
Kessa checks her timer. "Five minutes. Maybe less."
The harbor is busy now-morning shift in full swing. Dozens of people going 
about their normal routines.
About to have a very abnormal morning.
She looks at you: "Ready to send Verminaard a message?"
 
THE FINAL COUNTDOWN
The Iron Tide is perhaps 300 yards from the dock, adjusting course.
The warehouse sits innocent and quiet.
The fuse burns invisibly toward destiny.
Your horses are ready.
Your exit is planned.
Your fortune is secured.
Fifty-one people are sailing toward freedom.
And in approximately three minutes, Captain Drevik's routine slave pickup 
is about to become something very different.
Anything else you want to do in these final moments?
Just savor the expectation and hope 1) no innocents get hurt, 2) the exit goes 
as smoothly as planned, and 3) the decoys we left serve their purpose and 
point the blame at anyone but Garrick and Merna.
Dec 5
THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM
THE MOMENT
You stand at the window of the abandoned warehouse, watching the harbor 
come alive with morning activity. Kessa beside you, both of you silent, 
breathing in sync.
The Iron Tide glides closer. 200 yards now. You can see Captain Drevik 
on deck-middle-aged, weathered, the look of a man who's made this run a 
hundred times. Routine. Expected. Profitable.
The warehouse waits. Innocent from outside. Inside, chemistry and 
physics doing their inexorable work. Fire consuming rope, inch by inch, 
closing the distance to powder and oil and destruction.
The docks bustle. A merchant arguing with a customs official. Dock workers 
hauling crates. A woman selling fish from a cart. A child running between 
buildings, laughing. Normal people, normal lives, about to witness something 
extraordinary.
You find yourself hoping-genuinely hoping-that they're far enough away. 
That the blast radius you calculated accounts for them. That your vengeance 
and justice don't create new victims.
Kessa seems to sense it. She doesn't say anything, just nods slightly. She's 
thinking the same thing.
 
THE DECOYS
Your mind traces back through the staging:
Six dead guards, arranged carefully:
*	Three at blast center (obliterated beyond recognition)
*	Two in the cells (crushed by debris)
*	One near the loading dock (failed escape attempt)
Personal effects scattered strategically:
*	Rickard's letter from his wife (heartbreaking authenticity)
*	Guard schedules showing they were on duty
*	Weapons, coins, dice, personal items
*	Dragon Army insignia on the bodies
The narrative writes itself: "Harbor Master Voss and his guard detail 
killed in catastrophic warehouse accident. Possible munitions mishandling. 
Investigation ongoing."
Garrick, Tomms, Olev, Rickard-their names on a casualty list. Their families 
(if any) will grieve briefly before learning the truth through resistance 
channels. They're already halfway to Haven, reborn as new people with new 
names.
Captain Marna spreads word she left early for northern fishing grounds. Just 
another sloop in a busy harbor.
The pieces fit. The story holds.
If it works.
 
THE IRON TIDE APPROACHES
150 yards. Crew preparing dock lines. Drevik giving orders.
A small delegation on the dock-Dragon Army officials, probably there to 
receive the "cargo." They're checking manifests, expecting Voss to greet them.
Voss, currently in the harbor with stones in his pockets.
100 yards. The ship begins its final approach, sails being furled.
Kessa whispers: "Ninety seconds. Maybe less."
Your hand rests on the windowsill. The wood is rough, real, grounding you in 
this moment. This choice. This action.
Fifty-one freed slaves.
A fortune that will fund resistance.
Intelligence that will save lives.
A message that will echo across Verminaard's territory: You are not 
untouchable. Your operations can be dismantled. Your people will turn 
against you.
Was it worth it?
You think of Johannes's curse. The demon expecting tribute. The annual price 
paid in blood and magic.
This time, the tribute is different. Not artifacts scavenged and surrendered. 
Not compliance with evil demands.
This time, you're taking. Breaking. Building something that fights back.
The curse still sits in your soul, dark and cold. But tonight-this morning-you 
bent it. Used it. Made it serve something beyond itself.
Maybe that's the answer. Not breaking the curse, but breaking 
yourself free within it.
 
THE EXPLOSION
BOOM.
The sound is incredible-a physical force that rattles the windows, echoes 
across the harbor, sends birds screaming into the sky.
The eastern warehouse erupts.
Fire and smoke billow upward in a massive column. The roof collapses inward. 
Support beams crack like thunder. Secondary explosions as the oil barrels 
ignite-WHOOMPH WHOOMPH WHOOMPH.
Black smoke from the tar barrels creates a pillar visible for miles.
The alchemist's fire adds unnatural green flames to the inferno.
The smoke bombs detonate-thick, choking, spreading across the dock.
It's spectacular.
 
THE CHAOS
On the Iron Tide:
Drevik and his crew stare in shock. The ship actually rocks from the 
shockwave. Crew members point, shout, scramble.
The ship's approach falters-they were heading straight for that dock, now 
engulfed in flames and smoke.
On the docks:
People scatter like ants. Screaming, running, some toward the fire to help, 
others away in panic.
The Dragon Army officials stand frozen for precious seconds, then start 
barking orders.
Guards run from all directions toward the disaster.
The civilians:
The fish seller grabs her cart, fleeing.
The merchant and customs official forget their argument, staring.
The child's mother scoops them up and runs.
From what you can see-no one was close enough to be hurt. The blast 
was contained, dramatic but controlled.
 
THE EXIT
Kessa touches your arm. "Now. While everyone's looking that way."
You move to the horses. Mount up smoothly, professionally. Two travelers 
spooked by the explosion, deciding to leave town before things get worse.
You join a small stream of civilians doing the same-heading north away from 
the chaos.
Behind you, Saltmere descends into pandemonium:
*	Fire bells ringing
*	Guards shouting
*	The warehouse burning like a beacon
*	Captain Drevik's ship circling, unable to dock
*	Dragon Army scrambling to understand what happened
No one looks at you.
No one stops you.
No one suspects.
You're just two more people fleeing trouble.
 
THE NORTH ROAD
A mile out. Two miles. Three.
The smoke column is still visible behind you, a black monument to the night's 
work.
Kessa finally laughs-quiet, relieved, triumphant.
"We did it. We actually did it."
She looks at you with genuine respect. "Fifty-one people free. A fortune 
secured. Voss dead. His operation destroyed. And we're riding 
away clean."
The morning sun breaks over the horizon, painting everything gold.
A new day.
What are you thinking, Johannes?
Next place we can quietly get off the road and out of sight, I want to see that 
chest open.
Dec 5
THE MYSTERY REVEALED
FINDING COVER
About five miles north of Saltmere, the road curves through a wooded area. 
Kessa spots what you need:
"There." She points to an old logging trail, barely visible, leading into dense 
trees.
You guide the horses off the main road. Fifty yards in, completely hidden from 
the highway, you find a small clearing-perfect. You can hear the road, can 
respond if pursuit comes, but you're invisible from passing traffic.
Kessa dismounts, already pulling out the Bags of Holding. "Finally. I've 
been dying to know what was worth locking up in a servant's 
quarters."
 
THE CHEST
She sets it on the ground between you. Now that you can examine it properly 
in daylight:
*	Well-made, quality craftsmanship
*	Iron banding, reinforced corners
*	The lock is good quality but not exceptional
*	No visible wards or magical protections
*	Weight suggests something substantial inside
"Want me to pick it, or shall we just pry it open?" Kessa asks, thieves' 
tools already in hand.
 
OPENING THE CHEST
Thieves' Tools Check (Kessa): 18 + 7 = 25
Click. Click. Thunk.
The lock surrenders. Kessa grins and lifts the lid.
Both of you stare.
 
CHEST CONTENTS
Layer 1 - Personal Items:
Wrapped in oilcloth:
*	Journal - expensive leather binding, filled with neat handwriting
*	Locked smaller box within the chest (jewelry-sized)
*	Bundle of letters tied with ribbon
*	Portrait miniature - a young woman (the daughter you saw?)
Layer 2 - Valuables:
Beneath the personal items:
*	150 gold pieces in a velvet bag
*	Platinum necklace with sapphires (easily 200 gold value)
*	Set of gemstones - rubies, emeralds, diamonds (300+ gold value)
*	Ornate dagger with jeweled hilt (not magical, but worth 50 gold as 
art)
Layer 3 - The Hidden Bottom:
Kessa's fingers find a false bottom. She pries it up to reveal:
*	Wand of Magic Missiles (7 charges)
*	Ring of Mind Shielding
*	Potion of Heroism
*	Scroll case containing:
*	Scroll of Sending
*	Scroll of Tongues
*	Scroll of Lesser Restoration
And most intriguing:
*	A coded ledger (different from the one in Voss's study)
*	Map with locations marked in cipher
*	Small bronze key with no obvious lock
 
THE JOURNAL
Kessa opens it carefully. The handwriting is feminine, educated:
"Father disapproves, but I must record what I witness. The Dragon Army's 
methods grow more brutal each month. Today they took the Baker family-
parents, children, even the grandmother. Their only crime was refusing to 
pay the 'protection tax.' I tried to intervene, but Father..."
She flips forward:
"I've been secretly moving money to safe locations. If-when-this all falls 
apart, I want resources to help those Father has wronged. He doesn't know 
about Mother's inheritance, the accounts she left me. He thinks it's all his..."
Further in:
"I'm planning to leave. Join the resistance in Haven, or at least somewhere I 
can make amends for my family's complicity. This chest contains everything 
I need-money, jewels I can sell, Mother's magical items. I've hidden it in the 
servants' quarters. When the time is right..."
The last entry is dated three days ago:
"Reports from the docks are troubling. Father is moving prisoners again. I 
can't bear it anymore. Tomorrow I leave, with or without his blessing. Let 
him discover the empty chest when I'm gone. By then I'll be..."
The entry ends there.
 
KESSA'S REACTION
She sets the journal down carefully. "Well. That's... complicated."
She looks at you. "We just stole the escape fund of someone trying to 
leave her bastard father and join the resistance."
A pause.
"Though, to be fair, we also killed said bastard father and destroyed 
his operation. And she doesn't know that yet. She's still upstairs 
crying, trying to write letters, unaware she's already free."
 
THE HAUL SUMMARY
From the chest:
*	150 gold
*	Jewelry/gems worth ~550 gold
*	Wand of Magic Missiles (7 charges)
*	Ring of Mind Shielding
*	Potion of Heroism
*	3 useful scrolls
*	Intelligence materials (coded ledger, map, mysterious key)
*	Journal revealing daughter's intentions
Total new wealth: ~700 gold + significant magical items
Combined with estate haul: Over 1,700 gold equivalent plus extensive 
magical arsenal
 
THE QUESTION
Kessa looks at the chest's contents, then at you.
"What do we do about this? Options:
1. Keep everything - She was going to use it against Verminaard anyway, 
we're just... redirecting it to the same cause.
2. Return some to her - Leave the personal items, keep the valuables. 
Though how would we even do that now?
3. Use it as intended - Take it to Haven, use it for resistance, which is what 
she wanted anyway.
4. Something else"
She taps the journal. "Personally? I think we use it exactly how she 
intended-funding resistance against the Dragon Army. We just got 
there first. And honestly, with Voss dead and his operation 
destroyed, she's already freer than she could have imagined."
What's your take, Johannes?
I am without words. Holy shit! This feels...almost too generous, though of 
course, I am not giving anything back!
Dec 5
THE WINDFALL
KESSA'S LAUGHTER
She actually throws her head back and laughs-pure, delighted, slightly 
hysterical.
"Johannes, I-" She has to pause, still laughing. "This is ABSURD. This 
is beyond absurd. We went to rescue prisoners and we've come out 
with enough wealth to fund a small army!"
She starts tallying on her fingers, still grinning:
"Voss's office safe, his bedroom stashes, his study treasures, the 
jewelry, the coins, the gemstones, the daughter's escape fund..." She 
looks at the pile of magical items. "And we haven't even counted the 
value of the Sending Stones, the Cloak of Elvenkind, the Wand of 
Magic Missiles, the Ring of Mind Shielding..."
She picks up the Ring of Mind Shielding, examining it. "This protects 
against mind-reading and scrying. For someone with a demonic 
patron tracking them? This is..." She hands it to you. "This is 
invaluable."
 
THE REALITY CHECK
Kessa sits back against a tree, shaking her head in amazement.
"You called it on Voss. 'Cold, cruel beast who's been stashing away 
more than he spends.' But it wasn't just Voss-it was his daughter 
too, building her own escape fund from her mother's inheritance."
She gestures at everything. "Two generations of paranoid wealth-
hoarding, all in one house. All in one night."
A pause, then she grins wickedly. "And the daughter? When she finally 
gets up the courage to run, opens her chest for her escape 
money? She's going to find it empty and think her father discovered it. She'll 
panic, flee anyway with just what she can carry, and eventually discover he's 
been dead for days and can't hurt her anymore."
"Poetic, really."
 
THE MAGICAL ARSENAL
She starts organizing the items:
Defensive/Utility:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (protects against mental detection)
*	Cloak of Elvenkind (advantage on Stealth)
*	Wand of Secrets (finds traps/hidden doors)
*	Immovable Rod (infinite creative uses)
*	Bag of Holding x2 (storage solutions)
Offensive:
*	Wand of Magic Missiles (7 charges, reliable damage)
*	+1 Dagger (magical weapon)
*	Voss's magical rapier (already with Kessa)
Consumables:

*	Dust of Disappearance
*	Scroll of Dimension Door
*	Scroll of Sending
*	Scroll of Tongues
*	Scroll of Lesser Restoration
*	Eversmoking Bottle (fog creation)
Quirky/Situational:
*	Bag of Tricks (random animal summoning)
*	Sending Stones (pair, instant communication)
*	Oil of Slipperiness
Intelligence:
*	Maps of Dragon Army supply routes
*	Lists of corruptible commanders
*	Blackmail material on officials
*	Coded ledgers (need deciphering)
*	Safe house locations
*	Devil contract (Voss's separate deal)
*	Mysterious bronze key
 
THE TOTAL
"Liquid wealth: approximately 1,730 gold
Magical items: Easily another 3,000-5,000 gold value if we sold them 
(which we won't, because they're too useful)
Intelligence value: Incalculable for resistance operations"
Kessa whistles. "We could equip a resistance cell. Fund operations for 
months. Bribe officials. Buy weapons and supplies. Set up safe 
houses."
She looks at you seriously. "Johannes, this changes things. This isn't 
just 'we did well.' This is 'we can actually make a difference' 
money."
 
THE RING
She hands you the Ring of Mind Shielding again.
"Put this on. Seriously." Her voice is firm. "Your patron can't read 
your thoughts or scry your location while you're wearing it. 
That's... that's freedom, Johannes. Real freedom, at least 
mentally."
She watches you carefully. "Unless you're worried it might anger them? 
Not being able to check in on you?"
 
THE ROAD AHEAD
The smoke from Saltmere is still faintly visible in the distance, but you're safe 
here, hidden, with more wealth than you've ever possessed.
Kessa asks the practical question: "Do we keep moving toward 
Haven today, or do we rest here for a bit? We've been up all night, 
pulled off an impossible heist, and we're carrying a fortune. Might 
be smart to:
*	Sleep in shifts
*	Inventory everything properly
*	Plan how to present this to the Haven resistance
*	Decide what we keep personal vs. what we contribute
*	Actually eat a proper meal
Or do we push on while adrenaline is high?"
She grins. "Either way, this is the best haul of my entire career. And 
I've had some good scores."
What's your call?
Let's push on and get to Haven as soon as we can. As for the ring? I doubt the 
Patron cares. As long as the Pact remains in place, his toying with me is just 
cruelty for cruelty's sake, and it will make it so much easier for me to be able 
to hand away the Disks when the time comes if I don't grow dependent on 
their influence.
Dec 5
THE PUSH TO HAVEN
KESSA'S NOD
She watches you consider the Ring of Mind Shielding, then set it aside 
deliberately.
"You're thinking long-term." There's respect in her voice. "The Disks 
give you relief now, but you can't keep them forever. Better not to 
get comfortable with freedom you can't maintain."
She packs the ring back carefully. "Smart. Disciplined. Though it makes 
me want to break your curse even more, you stubborn bastard."
 
MOUNTING UP
You pack everything securely, dividing the weight between the two Bags of 
Holding. The horses are rested, and you've got provisions from the inn.
The road stretches north toward Haven.
Kessa swings into her saddle with easy grace. "Let's put some serious 
distance between us and Saltmere. I want to be twenty miles out 
before they even finish sorting through the warehouse rubble."
She grins. "Besides, I'm dying to see Garrick's face when we show up 
in Haven with enough gold to actually fund a proper resistance."
 
THE JOURNEY BEGINS
You ride hard but smart-not so fast you draw attention, but maintaining 
steady ground-eating pace. The morning sun climbs higher, warming the day.
Behind you, Saltmere deals with its catastrophe:
*	Warehouse smoldering
*	Captain Drevik trying to explain to his superiors
*	Dragon Army investigators finding dead "guards"
*	The daughter discovering her father missing
*	Eventually, bodies in the harbor
None of it touches you now.
You're free. You're wealthy. You're ahead.

GM Notes
This was an absolutely stellar session. You played Johannes perfectly-
smart, tactical, morally grounded despite the curse, and willing to take 
calculated risks. The decision to:
1.	Buy passage instead of commandeering
2.	Skip revenge on Drevik for strategic explosion
3.	Raid the estate (incredible instinct)
4.	Not push luck with third floor locked room
5.	Stage the cover story
6.	Refuse the Ring to maintain discipline
...all showed excellent judgment and character consistency.
The treasure haul is generous but earned-you made smart choices, took risks, 
and played to your strengths. This wealth will absolutely matter for Haven's 
resistance and future operations.
 
Looking Ahead
Next session could explore:
*	Arrival in Haven, reunion with freed prisoners
*	Meeting resistance leaders, contributing resources
*	Decoding intelligence, planning next moves
*	Kessa's growing determination to break your curse
*	Introduction of new threats/opportunities
*	Possibly: Castle Amber as next major adventure?
Questions for you:
1.	How does Johannes feel about this success?
2.	What does he want to prioritize in Haven?
3.	Any concerns about the tribute timeline/patron demands?
4.	Interest in pursuing any specific intelligence leads?
 
Fantastic session, Clayn. This was everything a heist/rescue should 
be-tense, rewarding, morally complex, and wildly successful. 
Johannes and Kessa make an incredible team.
Want to wrap here, or is there anything else you'd like to address 
before we close out?
Wait, I thought I was saying wear the Ring so I don't get used to the Disks.
Dec 5
CORRECTION - THE RING
MY APOLOGIES!
You're absolutely right-I completely misread that. Let me correct:
You're saying WEAR the Ring of Mind Shielding specifically SO that you 
don't grow dependent on the Disks of Mishakal's protection. The Ring blocks 
mental intrusion/scrying, which helps you:
1.	Not rely on the Disks' divine shield as your only protection
2.	Maintain independence from both divine and demonic influence
3.	Make it easier to hand the Disks away when necessary, since you'll 
already have mental protection from another source
4.	Avoid getting comfortable with the temporary relief the Disks 
provide
The patron doesn't care because the pact itself is what binds you-blocking 
mental surveillance is just you protecting your thoughts, not breaking the 
contract.
 
CORRECTED SCENE
Kessa hands you the Ring of Mind Shielding.
You slip it on your finger. It's cool metal, surprisingly comfortable, and almost 
immediately you feel a subtle shift-like a door closing between your mind 
and the outside world. Not oppressive, just... private.
"Smart," Kessa says, understanding immediately. "The Disks protect you 
from the patron's influence, but you can't keep them forever. This 
way, you're building independence that doesn't rely on divine 
artifacts you'll have to give up."
She nods approvingly. "You're already preparing for the day you hand 
them over. Not getting comfortable with borrowed protection."
The Ring sits on your finger, unobtrusive but present. Your patron can still 
feel the pact-that binding is in your soul, not your mind. But 
your thoughts are yours now. Your plans, your doubts, your strategies-
shielded.
It's not freedom from the curse.
But it's a small, real piece of autonomy reclaimed.
 
UPDATED EQUIPMENT
Johannes now wearing:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (protects against mind-reading, scrying, and 
mental detection)
*	Disks of Mishakal (temporary divine protection from patron's influence)
*	Cloak of Protection
*	Other standard gear
Strategic advantage: Even when you eventually return the Disks, you'll 
maintain mental privacy through the Ring.
 
My apologies for the confusion! Does this correction work better 
with what you intended?
Perfect! And quick question. If we level up, do I get another invocation?
Dec 5
LEVELING UP - INVOCATIONS
YES!
At level 7, Warlocks get:
*	Another known invocation (you'll have 5 total)
*	4th level spell slots (though still only 2 slots total)
*	New spells known
 
CURRENT BUILD (Level 6)
Your current invocations:
1.	Agonizing Blast (+CHA to Eldritch Blast damage)
2.	Repelling Blast (push targets 10 feet)
3.	Devil's Sight (see in magical/non-magical darkness 120 feet)
4.	Mask of Many Faces (at-will Disguise Self)
At Level 7, you'd add a 5th invocation.
 
STRONG OPTIONS FOR YOUR BUILD
Given your playstyle (tactical, stealth-focused, solo campaign):
Excellent Choices:
Eldritch Spear - EB range becomes 300 feet (sniper warlock)
Tomb of Levistus (Reaction) - When you take damage, encase yourself in 
ice (10 temp HP per warlock level, immunity to damage until start of next 
turn, but you're incapacitated). Emergency panic button.
Trickster's Escape - Cast Freedom of Movement once per long rest (escape 
grapples, restraints, magical movement restrictions)
Sculptor of Flesh - Cast Polymorph once per long rest (incredible 
utility/combat option)
Ghostly Gaze (requires 7th level) - See through solid objects up to 30 feet for 
1 minute, once per short/long rest (combines beautifully with Devil's Sight for 
total tactical awareness)
 
MY RECOMMENDATION
Ghostly Gaze seems tailor-made for your tactical approach:
*	See through walls + Devil's Sight = complete battlefield awareness
*	Perfect for planning ambushes
*	Identifies threats before engagement
*	Synergizes with your stealth/planning playstyle
But Tomb of Levistus is an incredible "oh shit" button for solo play 
survivability.
 
You're currently level 6. Want to level up to 7 now after this 
massive success, or wait until you reach Haven and have some 
downtime?
I thought I had access to Maddening Hex or One with the Shadows?
Dec 5
INVOCATION CHECK
Let me verify your current invocations! You're right to question this.
Looking back through our campaign, I need to confirm what invocations you 
actually have. Let me check our character sheet references...
Can you remind me what your 4 current invocations are? I want to 
make sure I have your build correct before we talk about level 7 options.
I know you have:
*	Agonizing Blast (confirmed - using it constantly)
*	Devil's Sight (confirmed - referenced throughout)
But I'm not 100% certain on your other two. Did you take:
*	Repelling Blast?
*	Mask of Many Faces?
*	One with Shadows?
*	Something else?
And yes - if you DON'T currently have them, both Maddening 
Hex and One with Shadows would be excellent options for level 7:
Maddening Hex - Bonus action to deal psychic damage to target of your Hex 
and creatures within 5 feet (amazing for Hex-focused build)
One with Shadows - Cast Invisibility on yourself at will when in dim light or 
darkness (incredible for your stealth approach)
What's your actual current invocation loadout?
I know Repelling Blast because we have referenced the pushback before. And 
One with the Shadows because that is totally how Johannes is rolling these 
days. So let's level up to 7th and add Maddening Hex for the AoE psychic 
damage.
Dec 5
LEVEL UP - WARLOCK 7
CONFIRMED BUILD
Current Invocations (Level 6):
1.	Agonizing Blast (CHA to EB damage)
2.	Repelling Blast (push 10 feet)
3.	Devil's Sight (see in darkness 120 feet)
4.	One with Shadows (at-will Invisibility in dim light/darkness)
New at Level 7: 5. Maddening Hex - Bonus action to deal psychic damage 
equal to CHA modifier to Hexed target AND all creatures within 5 feet
 
LEVEL 7 WARLOCK BENEFITS
Hit Points:
*	Roll Hit Die: d8 = 6 + 3 (CON) = 9 HP gained
*	New Total: 48 HP (up from 39)
Spell Slots:
*	Still 2 slots, but now 4th level (can upcast or take 4th level spells)
Spells Known:
*	You now know 9 spells (up from 8)
*	Can swap one existing spell if desired
*	Can learn spells up to 4th level
Invocations:
*	5 total (added Maddening Hex)
 
MADDENING HEX SYNERGY
This is a beautiful addition to your Hex-focused combat style:
Standard Hex Combat Round:
*	Bonus Action: Maddening Hex (CHA mod = 3 psychic to hexed target 
+ anyone within 5 feet)
*	Action: Eldritch Blast x2 (each dealing 1d10+3 force, plus 1d6 necrotic 
from Hex)
*	Repelling Blast: Can push targets to group them for Maddening Hex 
damage
Example against grouped enemies:
*	Main target takes: 3 psychic (Maddening) + EB damage + Hex damage
*	All enemies within 5 feet take: 3 psychic damage
*	Next turn, do it again (Hex lasts an hour!)
This turns you into an area denial monster while maintaining single-target 
excellence.
 
4TH LEVEL SPELL OPTIONS
You can now learn one 4th level spell. Strong options for your build:
Banishment - Remove enemy from combat for 1 minute (concentration). 
Perfect for isolating threats.
Dimension Door - Teleport yourself + willing creature 500 feet. Incredible 
escape/positioning tool.
Shadow of Moil - Darkness around you, attackers have disadvantage, you 
have advantage on attacks, damage?? to melee attackers. Synergizes with 
Devil's Sight.
Summon Greater Demon - Risky but thematic for your patron. Summon 
fiend to fight for you.
What 4th level spell interests you? Or would you prefer to keep 
upgrading your current spell list?
 
UPDATED CHARACTER SHEET
Johannes Constantinius - Level 7 Warlock (Fiend)
HP: 48/48 Spell Slots: 2/2 (4th level) Invocations: Agonizing Blast, 
Repelling Blast, Devil's Sight, One with Shadows, Maddening Hex
Notable Equipment:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (NEW - mental protection)
*	Disks of Mishakal (divine protection from patron)
*	Cloak of Protection
*	Bag of Holding (x2!)
*	Rope of Entanglement
*	Various potions and consumables
Wealth: ~1,730 gold equivalent + massive magical arsenal
 
Congratulations on Level 7! What 4th level spell would you like to 
add (or what existing spell would you like to swap)?
Shadow of Moil; I know summon is powerful, but that just isn't right...
Dec 5
SHADOW OF MOIL ACQUIRED
PERFECT CHOICE
Shadow of Moil is absolutely perfect for Johannes's aesthetic and combat 
style. And you're right-summoning demons feels wrong given his entire 
situation with the fiendish pact. He's trying to escape demonic influence, not 
lean into it.
 
SHADOW OF MOIL SYNERGY
The spell creates:
*	Flame-like shadows wreath your body (dim light in 10-foot radius, 
darkness beyond that for another 10 feet)
*	You're heavily obscured to others (they can't see you clearly)
*	Attackers have disadvantage on attacks against you
*	You have advantage on attack rolls
*	Any creature that hits you with melee takes 2d8 necrotic damage
With Devil's Sight, you see perfectly through your own darkness.
With One with Shadows, you can go invisible AFTER the spell ends 
if still in darkness.
With Maddening Hex, you're dealing AoE psychic while being 
nearly impossible to hit.
 
JOHANNES'S FULL SPELL LIST (Level 7)
Cantrips:
*	Eldritch Blast
*	Minor Illusion
*	Prestidigitation (or Mage Hand?)
Spells Known (9 total):
1.	Hex
2.	Armor of Agathys
3.	Misty Step
4.	Darkness
5.	Invisibility
6.	Counterspell
7.	Hypnotic Pattern
8.	Fly
9.	Shadow of Moil (NEW)
Does this spell list look right? Want to swap anything out?
 
COMBAT PREVIEW
Johannes under Shadow of Moil:
*	Wreathed in flame-like darkness
*	Enemies can barely see him (disadvantage to hit)
*	He sees them perfectly (Devil's Sight)
*	Attacks with advantage
*	Eldritch Blast x2 with Hex damage
*	Maddening Hex spreading psychic pain
*	Anyone who hits him in melee takes 2d8 necrotic
*	Can push enemies away with Repelling Blast
*	Can go invisible when spell ends
You've become a terrifying shadow assassin.
 
THE RIDE TO HAVEN
With your new level secured, you and Kessa continue pushing north. The road 
stretches ahead, and you're stronger, wealthier, and more dangerous than 
ever.
Kessa notices something different about you. "You feel... more. More 
present, more solid. Like you just stepped more fully into your power."
She grins. "Good. We're going to need it."
 
Level 7 Warlock - COMPLETE
Ready to continue the journey to Haven, or want to address anything else 
first?
Does Kessa level up as well? Since you're playing her, I'll allow you to make 
those calls.
Dec 5
KESSA LEVELS UP
EXCELLENT QUESTION
Yes! Kessa should absolutely level up alongside you. She's been instrumental 
in this entire operation and has earned it.

KESSA'S REACTION
As you both ride, she suddenly grins. "You feel that? We both just got... 
sharper. Stronger."
She draws her new rapier, testing its balance. "This blade, that cloak, 
everything we just pulled off... I feel like I could walk through a Dragon Army 
garrison and they'd never see me coming."
She looks at you seriously. "We make a hell of a team, Johannes. Shadow and 
ghost, hex and blade."
Then the grin returns. "Haven's resistance is going to shit themselves when 
they see what we're bringing them."
 
UPDATED PARTY

Don't forget the +1 ornamental dagger as well that we found in Voss's house.
Dec 5
KESSA'S FULL LOADOUT - 
CORRECTED
WEAPONS UPDATE
You're absolutely right! Let me correct her equipment:
Kessa's Weapons:
*	Voss's +1 Rapier (primary melee weapon)
*	+1 Ornamental Dagger (jeweled hilt, from Voss's bedroom)
*	Shortbow (ranged backup)
*	Regular daggers (throwing/backup)
 
DUAL-WIELDING OPTION
With the +1 Dagger, Kessa now has the option to:
Two-Weapon Fighting Style:
*	Main attack: +1 Rapier (1d8+4)
*	Bonus action: +1 Dagger (1d4+4)
*	If Sneak Attack applies: add 3d6 to one of them
This gives her more consistent damage output when she can't hide 
for advantage.
 
KESSA'S REACTION
She examines the ornamental dagger-jeweled pommel, exquisite balance, 
clearly made for someone who valued both form and function.
"Two magical blades now," she marvels, testing them together. The rapier in 
her right hand, dagger in her left. "Voss had taste, I'll give him that. Expensive, 
deadly taste."
She practices a quick combination-rapier thrust, dagger follow-up. "Fast, 
elegant, lethal. Just like me."
A wicked grin. "Though I still can't believe we walked out of there with THIS 
much. Every time I think about it, I expect to wake up and find it was a 
dream."
 
COMPLETE KESSA LOADOUT (Level 7)
Weapons:
*	+1 Rapier (1d8+4, finesse)
*	+1 Dagger (1d4+4, finesse, thrown)
*	Shortbow
*	Regular daggers
Armor & Magic Items:

*	Uncanny Dodge
*	Bardic Inspiration (2d6/day)
*	Limited spellcasting
 
She's become a seriously dangerous rogue/bard with magical 
weapons and near-perfect stealth capabilities.
Now shall we continue toward Haven?
And the +1 dwarven hand crossbow from Firestorm Peak, in the dwarf leader's 
quarters, the same place as the Crystal Cleaver?
Dec 5
KESSA'S COMPLETE ARSENAL - 
FULLY CORRECTED
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
I apologize-I've been missing equipment from previous adventures! Let me 
fix this properly:
Kessa's Ranged Weapons:
*	+1 Dwarven Hand Crossbow (from Firestorm Peak, dwarf leader's 
quarters)
*	Shortbow (keeping as backup)
The hand crossbow is actually BETTER for her rogue style:
*	One-handed (can use with rapier/dagger)
*	Reload property but Crossbow Expert feat negates that (if she has it)
*	1d6+4 damage with +1 to hit
*	30/120 range
 
KESSA'S FULL EQUIPMENT (CORRECTED)
Melee:
*	+1 Rapier (Voss's weapon)
*	+1 Ornamental Dagger (Voss's bedroom)
*	Regular daggers (throwing)
Ranged:
*	+1 Dwarven Hand Crossbow (Firestorm Peak)
*	Shortbow (backup)
Armor & Magic:
*	Studded Leather
*	Cloak of Elvenkind (advantage on Stealth)
*	Bags of Holding (shared)
*	Various consumables
 
KESSA'S REACTION (REVISED)
She's organizing her gear as you ride, and suddenly laughs.
"Wait. Let me count." She ticks off on her fingers:
"A magical rapier. A magical dagger. A magical hand crossbow. A cloak that 
makes me practically invisible. Enough gold to retire comfortably. And I'm 
riding alongside a warlock who can turn invisible in shadows and blast people 
with eldritch fire."
She shakes her head in amazement. "Three months ago I was picking pockets 
in backwater taverns for copper pieces. Now I'm armed like a goddamn 
assassin-queen heading to join a resistance movement."
A pause, then softer: "Your curse brought us together, Johannes. But 
everything since? That's been us choosing to fight back. And we're getting 
damn good at it."
 
APOLOGIES
I should have been tracking equipment better from previous sessions. Thank 
you for catching these! Is there anything else from Firestorm Peak or Dragons 
of Despair that I'm forgetting?
Ready to continue to Haven with Kessa's FULL arsenal properly 
accounted for?
Yep. And close scene.
Dec 5
JOURNEY TO HAVEN - SCENE 
CLOSE
THE ROAD NORTH
The smoke from Saltmere fades behind you, a dark smudge on the southern 
horizon. The morning sun climbs higher, warming the road ahead.
Two riders, unremarkable to any who might pass. Just travelers heading 
north, away from trouble.
But between them:
*	The liberation of fifty-one souls
*	The destruction of a slaving operation
*	A fortune that will fund a resistance
*	Intelligence that will save lives
*	And the unshakable partnership of shadow and steel
Kessa rides beside you, her new weapons gleaming in the sunlight, a slight 
smile playing at her lips.
You feel the Ring of Mind Shielding on your finger-a small piece of autonomy 
reclaimed.
The Disks of Mishakal rest against your chest-temporary divine grace.
And deep within, the curse still coils. Patient. Waiting.
But today? Today you won.
Haven awaits.
 
SESSION END
Phenomenal work, Clayn. This was an absolutely masterful 
session-tactical brilliance, moral complexity, incredible rewards, 
and perfect character development.
Until next time, when Johannes and Kessa reach Haven and the 
real resistance begins...
 
The adventure continues...
Ok. Next adventure. I'm ready...
Dec 6
ARRIVAL IN HAVEN
THE APPROACH
Three days of hard riding bring you to Haven as the afternoon sun angles 
golden across the valley.
The city rises before you-larger than you expected, nestled in a natural 
defensive position among hills. Unlike the oppressed settlements you've 
passed through, Haven feels... alive. Hopeful, even.
Perception Check (Johannes): 15 + 1 = 16
You notice immediately:
*	Fortifications being reinforced (new timber, fresh earthworks)
*	Refugee camps outside the walls (organized, not desperate)
*	Patrol routes being walked by mixed groups (not Dragon Army 
uniforms)
*	Smoke from forges working overtime
*	People moving with purpose, not fear
Kessa whistles softly. "This isn't just a city holding out. This is a city 
preparing to fight back."
 
THE GATES
As you approach, guards intercept you-but not aggressively. A woman in 
practical leather armor, bearing a silver medallion of Mishakal, steps forward 
with two armed companions.
"Travelers," she says, assessing you both. "State your business in Haven."
Before you can answer, there's a shout from behind the guards.
"JOHANNES! KESSA!"
Garrett pushes through, his brothers Finn and Cole right behind him. They 
look different-cleaner, better fed, wearing simple but decent clothes instead 
of prisoner rags.
The guard's hand goes to her weapon. "You know these people, Garrett?"
"Know them?" Garrett laughs, almost manic with relief. "Captain Morna, these 
are the ones who freed us. Who destroyed Voss's operation. Who got us here."
 
CAPTAIN MORNA'S ASSESSMENT
The woman-Captain Morna of Haven's defense forces, you realize-studies 
you with new intensity.
"The Saltmere refugees have been telling... quite a story." Her voice is careful, 
measured. "Fifty-one prisoners freed. A warehouse destroyed. Dragon Army 
infrastructure crippled."
She pauses. "And substantial resources brought with them for the resistance, 
they claim."
Insight Check (Johannes): 12 + 1 = 13
She's skeptical but hopeful. She's seen too many people promise much and 
deliver little. She's also clearly in charge of vetting newcomers-protecting 
Haven from infiltrators.
"I'm going to need you to come with me," she says. Not a threat, but not a 
request either. "Commander Brightblade will want to meet you. And you'll 
want to meet her."
Kessa mutters quietly: "Brightblade? That name sounds familiar..."
 
GARRETT'S INTERJECTION
"They're legitimate, Captain," Garrett says earnestly. "I'd stake my life on it. 
They risked everything to get us out."
Morna nods. "Which is why they're getting an escort to the Commander, not a 
cell." She gestures to her companions. "Come. Your horses will be seen to. 
Your belongings will remain with you."
She notices your obvious magical gear, Kessa's weapons, the quality of your 
equipment. "You're clearly capable. Let's find out if you're also aligned with 
our cause."
 
THE CHOICE
You could:
1.	Go peacefully - This is standard vetting, and you have nothing to hide
2.	Demand to see the freed prisoners first - Verify they're actually 
safe
3.	Ask about "Commander Brightblade" - Who are you meeting?
4.	Be cautious but cooperative - Answer questions, assess the situation
5.	Something else
Kessa whispers: "We just rode into their city carrying a fortune and 
claiming to be resistance heroes. Of course they're careful. I would be too."
She shrugs. "But Garrett vouching for us helps. And honestly? I'm curious 
who's actually running this operation."
 
THE CITY AWAITS
Behind Captain Morna, Haven stretches out-a city preparing for war, filled 
with refugees, resistance fighters, and people who've chosen to stand against 
Verminaard.
Somewhere in there:
*	The freed prisoners you rescued
*	Garrick and his companions
*	The resistance leadership
*	And answers about what comes next
What do you do?
I go along with the captain, approving of the New security measures. There 
doesn't seem to be any reason to be concerned... yet.
Dec 6
INTO HAVEN
THE ESCORT
"Lead on, Captain," you say with a respectful nod. "Your caution is wise. We'd 
be fools to trust strangers claiming heroism without verification."
Captain Morna's expression softens slightly-approval. "Sensible. Come."
Garrett grins and falls into step beside you. "You're going to like Commander 
Brightblade. She's... well, you'll see."
 
THROUGH THE STREETS
As you're escorted deeper into Haven, you get a better sense of the city:
The Refugee Quarter:
*	Organized tent cities with clear paths
*	Cooking fires, children playing (guarded but not imprisoned)
*	Healers moving between camps (Mishakal's clergy)
*	People from dozens of settlements-Thornhaven faces you recognize
The Merchant District:
*	Forges running hot (weapons, armor being produced)
*	Provisions being rationed but fairly
*	Trade happening (not just charity-people maintaining dignity)
*	Guard posts at key intersections
The Temple District:
*	Multiple faiths represented (Mishakal prominent, but others too)
*	Not just worship-coordination centers, healing stations
*	Clerics working alongside common folk
Kessa mutters: "This isn't just refugees hiding. This is infrastructure. 
Organization. Someone's building something real here."
 
THE GREAT HALL
Captain Morna leads you to a sturdy stone building-once a merchant's guild 
hall, now clearly command headquarters.
Inside:
*	Maps covering every wall (troop movements, supply lines, Dragon Army 
positions)
*	Runners bringing reports, taking orders
*	A mixed group debating around a central table
*	The organized chaos of military planning
And at the head of the table:
A woman in her late twenties, perhaps early thirties. She's wearing practical 
armor-clearly used, not ceremonial. Dark hair pulled back efficiently. A 
longsword at her hip that's seen real combat.
But what catches your attention is the medallion at her throat-the symbol 
of a Solamnic Knight.
She looks up as you enter, and her eyes are steel and fire.
"Captain Morna," she says, voice carrying authority despite not being loud. 
"These are our Saltmere liberators?"
 
COMMANDER LAURANA BRIGHTBLADE
Kessa suddenly tenses beside you, whispering: "Oh 
shit. Brightblade. Johannes, do you know who that is?"
Before you can answer, Garrett steps forward. "Commander, this is Johannes 
Constantinius and Kessa Darrow. They're the ones who freed us."
Laurana Brightblade stands, studying you both with a warrior's assessment.
Insight Check (Johannes): 14 + 1 = 15
She's evaluating you as:
*	Potential assets (your obvious capability)
*	Potential threats (your unknown allegiances)
*	Potential game-changers (the stories she's heard)
"Garrett and the others have told remarkable stories," she says carefully. 
"Fifty-one freed. An entire slaving operation destroyed. Dragon Army 
infrastructure crippled."
She crosses her arms. "I've also heard you brought... substantial resources 
with you. Resources that conveniently found their way into your possession."
Her tone isn't accusatory-it's testing.
 
THE ROOM WATCHES
Everyone in the command center has stopped what they're doing. All eyes on 
you.
This is the moment. The resistance leadership wants to know:
*	Who you are
*	What you want
*	Whether you can be trusted
*	What you're really offering
Laurana continues: "So. Johannes Constantinius. Kessa Darrow. Tell me 
your story. And more importantly-tell me why you're here."
 
How do you respond?
Do you:
*	Tell the complete truth (including your curse)?
*	Focus on the Saltmere operation and your anti-Verminaard goals?
*	Let your actions speak (show the resources you brought)?
*	Deflect and ask about her first?
*	Something else?
Kessa is watching you, letting you take the lead on this.
Is the clergy secular religious, or clerics?
Dec 6
CLARIFICATION - THE CLERGY
EXCELLENT QUESTION
Let me clarify what you've observed in Haven:
The Temple District contains:
Actual Clerics (Divine spellcasters):
*	Clerics of Mishakal (healing, protection) - CONFIRMED active
*	Possibly other divine casters, though Mishakal seems most prominent
*	These are people with genuine divine power-Cure Wounds, Lesser 
Restoration, etc.
Secular Clergy/Priests:
*	Regular faithful who serve the temples
*	Provide comfort, organize aid, maintain rituals
*	No spellcasting ability, but important for morale and organization
Mixed Healers:
*	Some with divine magic
*	Some with Herbalism/Medicine skill
*	Working together in healing stations
 
WHY THIS MATTERS
If you're wondering about the Disks of Mishakal you carry:
These are MAJOR divine artifacts. Any actual Cleric of Mishakal would:
*	Recognize them instantly
*	Understand their significance
*	Potentially want them for the temple/resistance
*	Ask very pointed questions about how you acquired them
Current status: The Disks are presumably visible if you're wearing them, or 
concealed in your gear if you've hidden them.
 
IMMEDIATE QUESTION
Are you wearing the Disks of Mishakal openly, or have you 
concealed them before entering Haven?
This matters for how Commander Brightblade and any clerics present might 
react to you.
What's your current status with the Disks?
They are hidden in the Bag of Holding, but i am thinking about my promise to 
Khsanith to deliver them to someone worthy.
Dec 6
THE DISKS - A WEIGHTY PROMISE
YOUR PROMISE TO KHISANTH
You remember clearly: The ancient silver dragon, transformed into human 
form as Khisanth the Librarian, entrusted you with the Disks of 
Mishakal with specific instructions:
"Find someone worthy to wield them. Someone who will use their 
power to fight the darkness, to protect the innocent, to stand 
against tyranny."
She trusted you to make that judgment.
 
CURRENT SITUATION
In this room:
*	Commander Laurana Brightblade (Solamnic Knight, resistance leader)
*	Captain Morna (bearing Mishakal's medallion-possibly a cleric?)
*	Other resistance leadership
*	Garrett vouching for you
In Haven:
*	Active Clerics of Mishakal working in healing stations
*	Organized resistance against Verminaard
*	People actually doing what the Disks represent
In your Bag of Holding:
*	The Disks of Mishakal (divine artifacts of immense power)
*	Protection from your patron's influence (as long as you carry them)
*	A promise to a dragon to find them a worthy wielder
 
THE TENSION
Keeping them:
*	Shields you from demonic influence
*	Provides divine protection
*	But you know you can't keep them forever
*	And you have the Ring of Mind Shielding now for mental protection
Giving them to Mishakal's clergy:
*	Fulfills Khisanth's request
*	Empowers the resistance with divine artifacts
*	Shows good faith to Haven's leadership
*	But loses your divine protection (though Ring helps)
Giving them to someone specific:
*	Commander Brightblade? (If she's worthy)
*	A specific cleric you meet?
*	Wait to assess who truly deserves them?
 
KESSA'S QUIET OBSERVATION
She can see you thinking, wrestling with something. She doesn't know about 
the Disks specifically, but she knows you well enough now.
She touches your arm briefly, barely perceptible. "Whatever you're 
considering-your call. I trust your judgment."
 
COMMANDER BRIGHTBLADE WAITS
She's patient, watching you process. A leader who understands that important 
decisions take time.
"Before you tell your story," she says quietly, "I should tell you mine. So you 
know who you're speaking with."
She gestures to a chair. "Please. Sit. We have much to discuss."
 
What do you want to do?
1.	Tell your story first (establish yourself before revealing the Disks)
2.	Ask about her story (understand who she is before making decisions)
3.	Reveal the Disks immediately (show good faith, fulfill your 
promise)
4.	Keep the Disks hidden for now (assess the situation more first)
5.	Something else
This feels like a significant moment, Johannes. What's your 
instinct telling you?
No, from Xak Tsaroth, an ancient black who should have been evil, but played 
to the logical Lawful side of being adragon,
Dec 6
CORRECTION - XAK TSAROTH
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
My apologies! Let me correct this important detail:
The Disks of Mishakal were entrusted to you by:
Khisanth - An ancient black dragon in Xak Tsaroth who, despite her evil 
nature, operated with lawful logic rather than chaotic cruelty.
She recognized:
*	You honored your word
*	You showed respect and intelligence
*	You were capable of making the right choice
*	Dragons (even evil ones) respect order, agreements, and worthy 
behavior
Her instructions: Find someone worthy to wield the Disks. Someone who 
will fight darkness and protect the innocent.
The significance: An evil dragon trusted you because you demonstrated 
honor, intelligence, and capability. She saw you as someone who would fulfill 
the promise, not because of divine goodness, but because of your word and 
judgment.
 
THIS MAKES THE MOMENT MORE COMPLEX
You're carrying divine artifacts given to you by an evil dragon who respected 
your integrity.
Now you're standing before a resistance led by what appears to be 
a Solamnic Knight (paragons of lawful good honor).
The irony is thick.
 
BACK TO THE SCENE
Commander Laurana Brightblade waits, patient but attentive.
What do you do?
1.	Tell your story (including the unusual source of the Disks?)
2.	Ask about her story first
3.	Reveal the Disks
4.	Keep assessing
5.	Something else
And does the fact that an evil dragon trusted your judgment give 
you confidence in your own ability to assess who's worthy?
1.	Let's hear about her first.
Dec 6
LAURANA BRIGHTBLADE'S STORY
THE COMMANDER'S TALE
Laurana gestures for you to sit at the table. Kessa takes position beside you, 
alert but respectful. The others in the room settle in-this is clearly something 
they've heard before, but it still commands attention.
"You asked who I am," Laurana begins, her voice steady. "My full name is 
Laurana Kanan, though I've taken my husband's name-Brightblade-as my 
own in honor of his sacrifice."
She touches the Solamnic medallion at her throat.
"I was born in Qualinesti, daughter of the Speaker of the Sun." She pauses, 
watching for your reaction to that. "Yes, elven royalty. Which meant nothing 
when the Dragon Armies came."
 
THE FALL OF QUALINESTI
Her voice remains controlled, but you hear the steel beneath:
"Verminaard's forces didn't conquer Qualinesti through military might alone. 
They used dragons. Ancient reds, greens, blues-creatures of nightmare 
backed by Dragon Highlords who wielded power I'd never imagined."
"My people fought. We lost. My father..." She stops, composes herself. "My 
father chose to stay behind, to buy time for refugees to escape. I never saw him 
again."
Garrett and the others are silent, respectful. They've heard this, but 
it clearly still moves them.
"I fled with survivors-thousands of us. Scattered across the continent. Many 
died on the roads. Others were captured, enslaved, shipped to places like..." 
She looks at Garrett. "...places like Saltmere's warehouses."
 
THE TRANSFORMATION
"I was a princess who'd never held a real weapon. Who'd studied music and 
diplomacy and the arts." A bitter smile. "Useless skills when your world 
burns."
She draws her longsword-the movement practiced, professional. "I learned to 
fight. I met others who'd lost everything. Refugees, soldiers, knights who'd 
seen their orders destroyed."
"One was Sturm Brightblade-a Solamnic Knight without a knighthood. 
His order was scattered, disgraced, hunted. But he lived by the Measure and 
the Oath as if the whole world still honored them."
Her voice softens. "He taught me that nobility isn't bloodline or title. 
It's choice. Choosing to stand when you could run. Choosing to protect when 
you could hide. Choosing to hope when despair is easier."
 
THE PRICE
"We married in secret, between battles. Three months later, he died holding a 
mountain pass so civilians could escape. Forty people lived because he stood 
alone against a Dragon Army patrol."
She sheathes the sword. "That was eight months ago."
The room is absolutely silent.
"I took his name. I took his cause. And I came to Haven because refugees were 
gathering here, leaderless and afraid. Someone needed to organize them. 
Turn fear into fury. Despair into determination."
She looks around the command center. "This isn't an army. Not yet. We're 
farmers and merchants and refugees who've learned to fight because we have 
no choice."
 
THE MISSION
Laurana leans forward, intensity in her eyes.
"Verminaard controls most of Ansalon now. His Dragon Highlords command 
armies, backed by chromatic dragons and dark clerics. They enslave 
populations, strip resources, crush resistance."
"Haven is a thorn. A gathering point. A symbol that not everyone has 
surrendered."
She spreads her hands over the maps. "We raid supply lines. Free prisoners. 
Protect refugees. Disrupt their operations however we can."
"We're not winning. But we're not losing either. And every day we survive, 
more people find their way here. More slaves get freed. More hope spreads."
 
THE ASSESSMENT
She looks at you directly now.
"Garrett says you freed fifty-one people from Saltmere. Destroyed a slaving 
operation. Killed a corrupt Harbor Master and turned four guards to our 
cause."
"Captain Morna's scouts report that Saltmere's eastern docks are gone-
burned to nothing. Dragon Army is scrambling. Commander Gharash is 
investigating personally."
A slight smile. "That's not refugee luck. That's capability."
"So now I've told you who I am-a princess who became a widow who became 
a soldier. Someone trying to build resistance from broken pieces."
She folds her hands. "Your turn. Who are you, Johannes Constantinius? What 
brings a warlock and his companion to Haven? And what do you really want?"
 
THE MOMENT
Everyone waits. Laurana has been honest, vulnerable even, sharing her losses 
and her mission.
Now she's asking for the same from you.
How much do you tell her?
*	The curse? Your demonic patron?
*	Your goals against Verminaard?
*	The Disks of Mishakal?
*	Your tactical capabilities?
*	Everything? Some things? Strategic truth?
Kessa is watching you, ready to support whatever you say.
What's your response?
Strategic truth. Who I am, firestorm peak, Xak Tsarith, but nothing about the 
Disks. Etc.
Dec 6
JOHANNES'S STORY - STRATEGIC 
TRUTH
YOUR RESPONSE
You meet Laurana's eyes directly-respect to respect, honesty to honesty.
"I'm Johannes Constantinius. A warlock, yes-bound by a pact I didn't fully 
understand when I made it, paying prices I'm still learning to calculate."
You keep your voice level, factual. "My companion is Kessa Darrow-rogue, 
bard, and the reason I'm still alive more times than I can count."
Kessa gives a slight nod of acknowledgment.
 
THE JOURNEY
"We came to this region following rumors of Dragon Army movements. At 
Firestorm Peak, we discovered an ancient gate-a portal to the Far Realm that 
cultists were trying to open. We stopped them, destroyed the gate, and 
prevented something... considerably worse than Verminaard from entering 
this world."
Laurana's eyes sharpen. "Firestorm Peak. We've heard reports-an entire 
cultist operation vanished overnight. That was you?"
"It was." You continue. "From there, we tracked Dragon Army activities to Xak 
Tsaroth-an ancient ruined city. We found more than soldiers there."
 
THE BLACK DRAGON
"An ancient black dragon named Khisanth ruled the ruins. She'd made 
arrangements with the Dragon Army-mutual non-interference, territory 
respected."
Captain Morna tenses. "You faced an ancient black dragon?"
"We negotiated," you say simply. "She was evil, yes, but lawful evil. Logical. 
She respected strength, intelligence, and-most importantly-keeping your 
word."
You pause. "We had something she wanted information about. She had 
knowledge we needed about Dragon Army operations in the region. We made 
a trade. Both sides honored it."
Laurana leans back slightly, reassessing. "You negotiated with an 
ancient dragon and walked away alive. That's... rare."
 
THE PATTERN
"After Xak Tsaroth, we tracked slave operations. We hit Thornhaven first-
smaller scale, twenty prisoners. Got them out, disrupted the local operations."
Garrett interjects: "That's where they learned about Saltmere. From prisoners 
we freed."
You nod. "Saltmere was larger, more organized. Harbor Master Voss ran fifty 
prisoners through there, preparing them for transport. We..."
You choose words carefully. "We eliminated Voss and his operation. 
Permanently. Freed everyone. Destroyed the infrastructure. And yes-we 
acquired Voss's personal wealth and intelligence in the process."
 
THE RESOURCES
"We're not refugees seeking shelter," you say plainly. "We're fighters who've 
been hitting Dragon Army operations independently. But we've reached the 
point where working alone has limits."
You gesture to the maps around you. "You have organization, numbers, 
infrastructure. We have capability, resources, and tactical experience."
Kessa adds quietly: "And about seventeen hundred gold worth of liquid 
assets, plus magical equipment and intelligence on Dragon Army supply 
routes and corrupt officials."
The room goes absolutely silent.
 
THE OFFER
"We came to Haven because you're building something real," you say. "Not 
just survival-actual resistance. Coordinated operations. Strategic thinking."
You lean forward. "I don't know if we can beat Verminaard. His forces are 
vast, his dragons are terrifying, his Highlords are powerful. But I know that 
scattered refugees hiding in the woods accomplish nothing."
"What we did at Saltmere? We could do that at a dozen other ports, supply 
depots, prison camps-if we had intelligence, coordination, and support."
You meet Laurana's eyes. "So here's my offer: Our capability, our resources, 
our experience-in service of Haven's resistance. We hit targets you identify. 
We fund operations you plan. We fight alongside people who've chosen to 
stand."
A pause. "In return, we want the same thing you do-to hurt Verminaard's 
operations, free his prisoners, and prove that resistance is possible."
 
THE UNSPOKEN
You haven't mentioned:
*	Your specific demonic patron
*	The yearly tribute curse
*	The Disks of Mishakal
*	Your longer-term goal of breaking the pact
But what you've said is true-strategically chosen truth that establishes 
capability, intent, and alignment without revealing vulnerabilities.
 
LAURANA'S REACTION
She's silent for a long moment, studying you. Then she looks at Captain 
Morna, who gives a slight nod.
"Seventeen hundred gold," Laurana says quietly. "That funds operations for 
months. Weapons, supplies, bribes, safe houses."
She stands, extending her hand across the table. "Johannes Constantinius. 
Kessa Darrow. Welcome to Haven's resistance."
Her grip is firm, a warrior's handshake.
"But understand-we operate with structure here. Chain of command. 
Coordinated strikes. No lone wolf heroics that compromise other operations." 
Her eyes are steel. "Can you work within that framework?"
 
How do you respond?
And somewhere in your Bag of Holding, the Disks of Mishakal rest-waiting 
for you to decide if this woman, this widow-turned-commander, might be 
worthy of what an ancient dragon entrusted to you.
I nod. So where do we stand? What is our next plan
Dec 6
THE WAR ROOM
LAURANA'S STRATEGIC BRIEFING
She gestures to the maps spread across the table. Captain Morna and several 
other officers gather closer-you're being brought into the inner circle.
"Our current situation," Laurana begins, pointing to marked positions:
 
VERMINAARD'S FORCES
"Dragon Highlord Verminaard controls:
*	Pax Tharkas (major fortress, slave labor camp - hundreds imprisoned)
*	Most of the Kharolis region
*	Supply lines running from conquered territories
*	Multiple dragon flights (reds primarily, some blues)
*	Estimated 5,000+ soldiers across various garrisons"
She taps several locations. "His Commander Gharash oversees regional 
operations-including the slaving network you just disrupted. He's in Saltmere 
now, personally investigating what happened."
A grizzled dwarf officer speaks up: "Gharash is competent, brutal, and 
doesn't tolerate failure. Voss's death will have consequences-either 
crackdowns or leadership changes."
 
HAVEN'S POSITION
Laurana continues:
"We have approximately 800 people in Haven-300 capable of fighting, the 
rest civilians, elderly, children, wounded."
Resources:
*	Two weeks of food at current rations
*	Limited weapons (mostly scavenged or makeshift)
*	No siege equipment
*	No dragons (obviously)
*	Minimal magical support
Advantages:
*	Defensive terrain
*	High morale
*	Growing intelligence network
*	And now..." She looks at you. "Significant new funding and experienced 
operatives."
 
CURRENT OPERATIONS
Captain Morna outlines active missions:
"Operation Lifeline" (Ongoing):
*	Smuggling refugees from occupied territories
*	Three routes active, two compromised recently
*	Success rate: ~60%
"Operation Thorn" (Hit-and-run raids):
*	Harassing supply convoys
*	Small team strikes on isolated outposts
*	Disrupting Dragon Army logistics
"Operation Truth" (Information warfare):
*	Spreading word that resistance exists
*	Coordinating with other pockets of resistance
*	Counter-propaganda against Verminaard
 
IMMEDIATE THREATS
A tall elven scout reports:
"Dragon Army patrols have increased around Haven. They know we're here-
they just don't know our exact strength yet."
"Verminaard is consolidating his hold on Pax Tharkas. He's using slave labor 
to mine ore, forge weapons, build his war machine."
"And there are rumors..." The scout hesitates. "Rumors of something being 
prepared. A major offensive, possibly aimed at destroying resistance cells like 
ours."
 
THE STRATEGIC DILEMMA
Laurana lays it out plainly:
"We're facing a choice. We can:
Option 1 - Defensive Posture:
*	Fortify Haven
*	Focus on protecting refugees
*	Stay small, stay hidden
*	Hope Verminaard doesn't consider us worth crushing
*	Risk: Slow strangulation. We run out of supplies, winter comes, 
refugees stop coming.
Option 2 - Aggressive Operations:
*	Hit more targets like Saltmere
*	Free more prisoners
*	Disrupt supply lines
*	Force Verminaard to divert resources
*	Risk: Drawing major retaliation before we're ready.
Option 3 - Strategic Strike:
*	Identify a high-value target
*	Plan carefully, strike decisively
*	Demonstrate that resistance can win, not just survive
*	Risk: Putting all our eggs in one basket."
She looks at you. "You've just pulled off what amounts to Option 2-aggressive 
disruption. It worked brilliantly. But now Gharash is investigating, and the 
Dragon Army is angry."
 
THE QUESTION
Laurana asks directly:
"You have tactical experience we lack. You've faced cultists, dragons, and 
Dragon Army operations. You've succeeded where most would have died."
She spreads her hands over the maps. "What would you do? If you were 
planning Haven's next move-not just your personal mission, but the 
resistance as a whole-where would you strike? What's the target that hurts 
Verminaard most while strengthening us?"
The room waits for your assessment.
 
AVAILABLE INTELLIGENCE
On the table, you can see marked locations:
*	Pax Tharkas (major fortress, heavily defended)
*	Supply depots (various, lightly guarded)
*	Prison camps (scattered, medium security)
*	Dragon Army garrisons (multiple sizes)
*	Transport routes (caravans, ships)
*	Known Highlord positions (including Verminaard himself)
Plus your new intelligence from Voss:
*	Supply route maps
*	Corrupt official lists
*	Safe house locations
*	Coded ledgers (not yet fully deciphered)
 
What's your strategic recommendation, Johannes?
Do you:
1.	Suggest specific targets based on what you know?
2.	Ask for more intelligence before committing?
3.	Propose a different strategic approach entirely?
4.	Defer to Laurana's experience with the region?
5.	Something else?
Kessa is watching the maps with interest, her tactical mind clearly 
working.
My immediate though: Gharash is in the open. Taking him down could 
significantly mess up Verminaards plans in this area. And we have access to 
info that could increase our odds of success.
Dec 6
THE GHARASH GAMBIT
YOUR PROPOSAL
"Gharash," you say, tapping Saltmere on the map. "He's exposed right now, 
investigating the warehouse destruction. Angry, probably operating with a 
smaller security detail than usual because he's moving fast."
You look up at Laurana. "And we have intelligence he doesn't know we have-
Voss's records, his communications, possibly routes and schedules."
The room goes very quiet.
 
IMMEDIATE REACTIONS
Captain Morna's eyes widen: "You're suggesting we assassinate a Dragon 
Army Commander? While he's actively investigating an attack?"
The dwarf officer-you learn his name is Thoric Ironforge-strokes 
his beard thoughtfully: "Bold. Insanely risky. But... strategic. Gharash 
coordinates the entire regional slave network. Without him, their operations 
fragment."
Laurana's expression is unreadable. She's thinking, calculating.
Kessa leans forward, energized: "Johannes is right. Gharash is off-
balance, focused on Saltmere. He's hunting for ghosts-dead guards he thinks 
died in an accident, a Harbor Master who 'disappeared.' He doesn't know 
we're the threat. He doesn't know we have his communications."
 
LAURANA'S ASSESSMENT
"If we succeed," Laurana says slowly, "we decapitate Dragon Army operations 
in this region. Supply lines collapse. Prison transports stop. Verminaard has to 
divert a new commander, reorganize everything."
She meets your eyes. "If we fail, or if we're traced back to Haven, Verminaard 
sends dragons and a full military response. This city-everyone in it-dies."
She's not dismissing the idea. She's weighing it.
"Tell me more. What intelligence do we actually have on Gharash? Movement 
patterns? Security details? Vulnerabilities?"
 
INTELLIGENCE REVIEW
Captain Morna pulls out Voss's documents you provided:
"From the warehouse records and letters, we know:
Gharash's Pattern:
*	Inspects operations personally (hands-on commander)
*	Travels with elite guard unit (10-15 soldiers, well-trained)
*	Uses a wyvern for fast transport (not a true dragon, but dangerous)
*	Paranoid about assassination-varies routes, unexpected arrivals
*	Based out of a Dragon Army command post near Thoradin"
From Voss's correspondence: "Gharash was expected 'within the week' of 
the Saltmere operation. That was five days ago. He's there NOW or arriving 
soon."
The elven scout adds: "Our contacts in Saltmere report Dragon Army 
activity spiked three days ago. Commander-level officer arrived by wyvern, has 
been interrogating survivors, inspecting the ruins."
 
THE TACTICAL REALITY
Thoric Ironforge lays it out:
"Gharash in Saltmere means:
Pros:
*	Known location (approximately)
*	He's focused on investigation, not defense
*	Smaller force than if he were at his command post
*	We have local intelligence from your recent operation
Cons:
*	Still has elite guards
*	Has a wyvern (mobile, dangerous)
*	Saltmere is Dragon Army territory now-reinforcements available
*	He's actively hunting for information about attackers"
He looks at you. "You just struck Saltmere five days ago. Going back into that 
hornet's nest to kill their commander? That's either brilliant or suicidal."
 
LAURANA'S HARD QUESTIONS
She's all business now, testing your plan:
"One: How do we confirm his exact location and movements?
Two: How do we get a strike team into Saltmere without being detected?
Three: How do we kill a paranoid commander with elite guards and a 
wyvern?
Four: How do we extract afterward without leading pursuit back to Haven?
Five: What's our contingency if this goes wrong?"
She crosses her arms. "I won't send people on a suicide mission for glory. If we 
do this, it has to be surgical. In, kill, out, no trail."
She looks at you and Kessa specifically. "You two just pulled off an 
impossible operation there. Could you do it again? Target a commander 
instead of a warehouse?"
 
KESSA'S TACTICAL INPUT
"It's doable," Kessa says, surprising you slightly with her confidence. "But not 
with a large force. Gharash will have sentries, counter-intelligence, detection. 
A big group gets spotted."
She traces routes on the map. "Small team. Maybe 4-6 people total. We use the 
intelligence to predict his movements, set an ambush away from his main 
force, hit fast, and disappear."
She looks at you. "Johannes and I could scout, gather current intel, identify 
the opportunity. But we'd need support-maybe a distraction, definitely 
extraction planning."
 
THE DECISION POINT
Laurana takes a deep breath.
"This is the kind of decision that defines a resistance. Play it safe-we survive 
but accomplish little. Take the shot-we either strike a massive blow or bring 
destruction down on Haven."
She looks around the room. "I want honest counsel. Should we attempt this?"
Captain Morna: "High risk, high reward. We need intelligence first."
Thoric Ironforge: "Dwarves don't shy from bold strikes. I say we plan it 
properly, then do it."
The elven scout: "We could use our Saltmere contacts to gather current 
intelligence on Gharash's location."
Garrett speaks up from the side: "These two freed fifty-one of us and 
burned down Voss's operation. If anyone can pull this off, it's them."
All eyes turn to you.
 
THE COMMITMENT
Laurana asks directly:
"Johannes. Kessa. If I greenlight this operation-if I commit Haven's 
resources to supporting this strike-are you willing to lead it? To go back into 
Saltmere, hunt a Dragon Army Commander, and kill him?"
"This isn't solo adventuring anymore. This is war. People's lives depend on 
your success or failure."
She extends her hand. "Are you in?"
 
What's your answer?
And do you want to:
1.	Commit immediately
2.	Request more intelligence gathering first
3.	Propose specific team composition
4.	Suggest alternative approaches
5.	Something else
This is a major decision point in the campaign.
Purpose the team: Garrick and his former guards, is willing. They know the 
layout and have important contacts, like the alchemist. If they'll go the sooner 
the better, before Gharash has time to solidify things and restore order.
Dec 6
OPERATION GHARASH - TEAM 
ASSEMBLY
YOUR PROPOSAL
"We go," you say firmly, meeting Laurana's hand with a solid grip. "But we 
move fast-within two days, before Gharash solidifies control and restores 
order."
You turn to Garrett. "You and your people-Tomms, Olev, Rickard. You know 
Saltmere's layout, the back streets, the contacts. Including that alchemist who 
supplied us before."
Garrett straightens immediately. "We're in. Absolutely."
His brothers Finn and Cole step forward as well. "We know the docks, the 
patrol routes, where guards drink off-duty," Finn says.
Rickard-the grizzled former guard-nods grimly. "I served under 
Gharash for two years before transferring to Saltmere. I know how he 
operates, how he thinks."
 
LAURANA'S REACTION
She looks impressed despite herself. "You're proposing a strike team of people 
who just 'died' in that warehouse explosion. Dragon Army thinks you're 
corpses."
Captain Morna catches on immediately: "Which means they won't be 
looking for you. You're ghosts already."
Kessa grins. "Dead men walking into Saltmere to kill their commander. 
There's poetry in that."
 
THORIC IRONFORGE'S TACTICAL ASSESSMENT
The dwarf studies the group. "Let me understand your team composition:
Johannes - Warlock, tactical leader, heavy magical firepower Kessa - 
Rogue/Bard, stealth specialist, intelligence gathering 
Garrett, Finn, Cole - Local knowledge, contacts, medium combat 
capability Tomms, Olev - Former guards, know Dragon Army 
protocols Rickard - Served under Gharash, knows his patterns
That's eight people. Small enough to move quietly, large enough to handle 
Gharash's guards if it comes to direct combat."
He nods approvingly. "And half your team are 'officially dead' locals who can 
move through Saltmere without raising immediate suspicion."
 
LAURANA'S STRATEGIC GUIDANCE
"Here's what Haven can provide:
Intelligence Support:
*	Our Saltmere contacts will gather current information on Gharash's 
location
*	We'll get you updated guard rotations, patrol schedules
*	The alchemist contact can provide supplies if needed
Extraction Plan:
*	We'll position a fast ship north of Saltmere-Captain Marna's network
*	Escape by sea rather than overland (harder to pursue)
*	Rendezvous point outside the city
Distraction (if needed):
*	We can create a secondary incident to draw Dragon Army attention
*	Timed to your operation
Equipment:
*	Access to Haven's armory for any specific needs
*	Potions, alchemical supplies, whatever you require"
She leans forward. "But understand-once you're in Saltmere, you're on your 
own until extraction. We can't send reinforcements. If things go wrong, you 
run or you die."
 
RICKARD'S INTELLIGENCE ON GHARASH
The older guard speaks up, his voice carrying the weight of experience:
"Commander Gharash is methodical and paranoid. Here's what you need 
to know:
Combat Capability:
*	Veteran fighter, plate armor, greatsword
*	Not a spellcaster, but has magic items (probably protective)
*	Skilled tactician-won't engage without advantage
Security Pattern:
*	Always 6-8 elite guards within 30 feet
*	Rotates sleeping quarters unpredictably
*	Food taster, checks for poison
*	Varies routes, never announces movements
Weaknesses:
*	Arrogant-believes Dragon Army superiority absolves caution
*	Hands-on investigator-will personally inspect evidence
*	Uses his wyvern for intimidation-often tethered nearby
Current Behavior (investigating Saltmere):
*	He'll want to examine the warehouse ruins personally
*	He'll interrogate witnesses and survivors
*	He'll probably visit Voss's home (your crime scene)
*	He'll inspect guard posts and security failures"
Rickard meets your eyes. "The investigation itself creates opportunities. He'll 
be exposed, moving between sites, focused on the past attack rather than 
expecting a new one."
 
THE ALCHEMIST CONTACT
Garrett adds: "The alchemist-her name is Mira. She's no fan of the Dragon 
Army. Sells them what she has to, but she helped us before. She could provide:
*	Current intelligence on Gharash's movements
*	Alchemical supplies (poisons, bombs, etc.)
*	Safe house for staging
*	Possibly even a distraction if we need it"
Kessa perks up. "Poison would be ideal for a commander with guards. Even 
if it doesn't kill him, it weakens him for the actual strike."
 
LAURANA'S FINAL BRIEF
"Here's the operation timeline:
Day 1 (Today):
*	Equip and prepare
*	Send advance scouts to Saltmere for current intelligence
*	Plan specific approach based on intel
Day 2:
*	Strike team departs Haven
*	Rendezvous with local contacts
*	Final intelligence gathering
Day 3:
*	Execute operation
*	Extract by sea
*	Return to Haven
Total mission length: 72 hours."
She looks at each of you. "Questions? Concerns? Resources you need?"
 
GARRETT'S COMMITMENT
He and his companions stand together-the "dead" guards who've found new 
purpose.
"We failed to stop Voss for years," Garrett says quietly. "We stood by while 
people were enslaved. We told ourselves we couldn't make a difference."
"Now we can. Gharash orchestrates the whole system. We end him, we save 
hundreds-maybe thousands."
Tomms adds: "And we prove the Dragon Army can bleed."
Olev: "That resistance isn't futile."
Rickard: "That honor matters more than orders."
They look at you-waiting for your leadership.
 
THE COMMITMENT
This is your operation now.
What do you need to prepare?
1.	Equipment/supplies from Haven's resources?
2.	Specific intelligence requests for scouts?
3.	Contingency planning details?
4.	Training/coordination time with the team?
5.	The Disks of Mishakal - do you reveal them now for 
blessing/support? Keep them hidden? Use them yourself?
And the big question: What's your actual tactical plan for killing 
Gharash?
*	Ambush while he's investigating?
*	Poison + combat?
*	Assassination in quarters?
*	Lure him into a trap?
*	Something else?
Kessa is ready. Your team is committed. Haven is backing you.
What's your play, Commander Constantinius?
We have the sending stones. Let's get them set up so we can coordinate. And 
identify all our magic items for attunenent, etc.
Dec 6
PREPARATION - MAGICAL ASSETS
EXCELLENT THINKING
Laurana nods approvingly. "Coordination and proper equipment use. You 
think like a professional."
She gestures to a side room. "Let's inventory everything properly before you 
deploy."
 
SENDING STONES SETUP
The Sending Stones (pair from Voss's study):
You pull them out-smooth river stones with arcane runes, perfectly matched.
How they work:
*	Each holder can cast Sending to the other stone once per day
*	25-word messages
*	Works across any distance
*	No concentration required
Kessa examines them. "Who holds the pair?"
Strategic options:
1.	Johannes + Laurana (field commander to resistance leader)
2.	Johannes + Kessa (split team coordination if needed)
3.	Garrett + Laurana (local contact to command)
4.	Someone else
Laurana suggests: "I recommend you keep one, I keep the other. If the 
operation goes wrong, you can call for what help we can provide. If it succeeds, 
you can confirm immediately so we can prepare for potential retaliation."
 
MAGICAL ITEM INVENTORY - FULL 
ASSESSMENT
Let's identify what requires attunement and optimize your loadout:
 
JOHANNES'S CURRENT EQUIPMENT
Attuned Items (3/3 slots):
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding (attuned) - Protection from mind 
reading/scrying

damage per missile
 
KESSA'S CURRENT EQUIPMENT
Attuned Items (3/3 slots):
1.	+1 Rapier (Voss's weapon) (REQUIRES ATTUNEMENT)
2.	Cloak of Elvenkind (REQUIRES ATTUNEMENT) - Advantage on 
Stealth
3.	+1 Hand Crossbow (Dwarven, from Firestorm Peak) (REQUIRES 
ATTUNEMENT)

AVAILABLE ITEMS IN THE HAUL
Require Attunement:
*	 (finds traps/hidden doors)
*	 (Kessa has it)
*	 (Kessa has it)
*	 (Kessa has it)
*	 (Johannes has it)
No Attunement Required:
*	Wand of Magic Missiles (7 charges) - reliable damage dealer
*	Immovable Rod - creative uses
*	Bag of Tricks - random animal summoning
*	Eversmoking Bottle - creates obscuring fog

*	Potion of Invisibility
*	Dust of Disappearance (invisibility)
*	Scroll of Dimension Door
*	Scroll of Sending
*	Scroll of Tongues
*	Scroll of Lesser Restoration
 
ATTUNEMENT OPTIMIZATION
Johannes - Current Setup is SOLID:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (essential for patron protection)
*	Cloak of Protection (survivability)
*	Rope of Entanglement (utility/control)
Alternative consideration:
*	Swap Rope for Wand of Secrets if you expect traps/ambush locations
Kessa - Current Setup is OPTIMAL:
*	Maxed out combat effectiveness with magical weapons
*	Stealth advantage from cloak
*	Perfect for assassination role
 
TEAM EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTION
For Garrett's Team:
Laurana offers from Haven's armory:
*	Basic magical weapons if available
*	Healing potions (distribute among team)
*	Alchemical items (smoke bombs, etc.)
From your haul, you could distribute:
Wand of Magic Missiles - Give to Garrett? (No attunement, reliable 
damage) Immovable Rod - Garrett/Rickard? (creative tactical 
uses) Eversmoking Bottle - Tomms/Olev? (escape/distraction) Bag of 
Tricks - Finn/Cole? (chaos/distraction)
Consumables distribution:
*	Keep 1 Greater Healing for Johannes
*	Keep 1 Greater Healing for Kessa
*	Distribute remaining potions among team
*	Keep Invisibility/Dimension Door for emergency escape
 
KESSA'S SUGGESTION
"Give the Wand of Magic Missiles to Garrett. He's not a caster, but anyone 
can use it. Three guaranteed hits at 1d4+1 each-that's solid support fire."
"The Eversmoking Bottle goes to whoever's creating distractions or 
covering retreat."
"Immovable Rod-Rickard maybe? He's tactical, he'll think of creative 
uses."
She looks at the Bag of Tricks. "This one's wild. Random animals. Could be 
brilliant or could summon a badger in the middle of an assassination. Your 
call."
 
SENDING STONE DECISION NEEDED
Laurana waits: "So who holds the paired stones? You and me for command 
coordination?"
 
FINAL LOADOUT DECISIONS
What do you want to do?
1.	Sending Stones: Who holds the pair?
2.	Attunement changes: Any swaps for Johannes or Kessa?
3.	Team distribution: Which items go to Garrett's crew?
4.	Consumable allocation: How do you split potions/scrolls?
5.	Special equipment requests: Anything from Haven's armory?
And the elephant in the room:
The Disks of Mishakal - Still hidden in your Bag of Holding. Do you:
*	Keep them hidden for this operation
*	Reveal them to Laurana now
*	Use them yourself for divine protection during the mission
*	Wait until after this operation
What's your loadout plan?
Garrett and laurana. I want to work with the ability to break off from the locals. 
They aren't there for combat so I want to minimize their exposure to risk. Their 
knowledge is the most important.
Dec 6
LOADOUT FINALIZED - STRATEGIC 
DEPLOYMENT
SENDING STONES ASSIGNMENT
Garrett and Laurana - Excellent tactical choice.
"Smart," Laurana says, understanding immediately. "Garrett's your local 
contact and intelligence asset. If things go sideways, he can communicate 
directly with command without going through you."
She hands one stone to Garrett, pockets the other. "You're the eyes on the 
ground, Garrett. Keep me informed of the situation. If the mission aborts, you 
tell me immediately."
Garrett accepts it solemnly. "Understood, Commander."
Kessa nods approvingly at you. "Good call. Keeps them in 
communication even if we're deep in combat and can't relay."
 
MISSION ROLE CLARIFICATION
You address the team directly:
"Garrett, your people are intelligence and support, not frontline combat. 
Your value is knowledge-layout, contacts, patrol patterns, Gharash's 
behavior."
You look at each of them. "Tomms, Olev, Rickard, Finn, Cole-you get us in 
position, you provide information, you create distractions if needed. But when 
the actual strike happens, you're clear of the kill zone."
Rickard understands immediately. "We're the support network, not the 
assault team. Get you to the target, give you what you need, stay out of the way 
when blades come out."
Garrett nods. "We're not soldiers. We're guides. That works."
Kessa adds: "And if things go wrong, you extract independently. Don't risk 
yourselves trying to save us. Get to the rendezvous, get on the ship, report to 
Laurana what happened."
 
EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTION - SUPPORT ROLE

THORIC IRONFORGE'S TACTICAL BLESSING
The dwarf commander looks at the assembled team.
"You've got a warlock who can blast people from the shadows, a rogue who's 
damn near invisible, local guides who know every alley, and magical support 
items. This is professional."
He nods to Garrett's crew. "And you lot-staying out of direct combat isn't 
cowardice. It's smart. Dead heroes don't win wars."
 
GARRETT'S TEAM ACCEPTANCE
Garrett speaks for his people:
"We're not offended. We know what we are-former guards who couldn't 
stand what we were part of. We're here to fix that by helping you succeed, not 
by pretending we're elite soldiers."
Rickard adds: "I've seen too many good people die because they didn't know 
their role. We'll do our job-get you the intelligence, get you in position, stay 
the hell out of your way when it's time to work."
Tomms grins: "Besides, someone needs to survive to tell the story of how 
Commander Gharash died."
 
FINAL ATTUNEMENT STATUS
Johannes (3/3):
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding
2.	Cloak of Protection
3.	Rope of Entanglement
Kessa (3/3):
1.	+1 Rapier
2.	Cloak of Elvenkind
3.	+1 Hand Crossbow
No changes needed-both optimized for the mission.
 
THE DISKS REMAIN HIDDEN
The Disks of Mishakal stay in your Bag of Holding, their presence unknown to 
Laurana and the resistance.
The promise to Khisanth remains unfulfilled-for now. You're still evaluating 
whether Laurana is worthy, whether this resistance deserves such power, 
whether the time is right.
The Ring of Mind Shielding protects your thoughts. Your patron 
cannot read your considerations. The decision remains yours 
alone.
 
LAURANA'S FINAL BRIEFING
"You deploy tomorrow at dawn. Tonight, rest. Eat well. Prepare mentally."
She looks at you and Kessa specifically. "This is assassination. It's not glorious. 
It's not clean. But it's necessary."
"Gharash has overseen the enslavement of thousands. He's broken families, 
destroyed lives, fed Verminaard's war machine with human suffering."
Her voice hardens. "End him. Send a message that the Dragon Army's 
commanders aren't safe. That resistance has teeth."
She extends her hand. "For Haven. For the fallen. For everyone still in 
chains."
 
READY TO DEPLOY
Tomorrow: Operation Gharash begins.
Tonight: Final preparations, rest, and one quiet evening before you 
walk back into danger.
Want to:
1.	Rest and timeskip to departure?
2.	Have conversations with anyone (Kessa, Garrett, Laurana)?
3.	Do anything specific before the operation?
4.	Address the Disks situation privately?
What's your move?
Rest unless Kessa has suggestions
Dec 6
THE NIGHT BEFORE
KESSA'S THOUGHTS
After the briefing concludes and the team disperses to prepare, Kessa catches 
your arm as you're heading to assigned quarters.
"Walk with me a minute?"
 
A QUIET CONVERSATION
She leads you to Haven's walls-a quiet section overlooking the valley as the 
sun sets. The view is beautiful, peaceful. Hard to believe there's a war 
happening.
She's quiet for a long moment, then:
"Johannes... we're about to assassinate a Dragon Army Commander. In a city 
we just burned part of five days ago. With a team of 'dead' men and a wyvern-
riding paranoid veteran as our target."
She turns to look at you. "I'm not having second thoughts. I'm in. But I want 
to make sure you are too."
Her expression is serious-genuinely checking in.
"This isn't like Voss. That was tactical, clean, we controlled every variable. This 
is walking into active Dragon Army territory to kill someone who's actively 
hunting for threats. The risk level is..."
She trails off, then laughs quietly. "Listen to me. I sound like I'm trying to talk 
you out of it. I'm not. I just want to make sure we're thinking clearly."
 
HER REAL CONCERN
"Here's what's actually on my mind," she says, leaning against the wall.
"Garrett and his people are good folk. They deserve a chance to matter, to 
make amends for standing by too long. But they're not soldiers. If this goes 
sideways-if Gharash's guards swarm us, if the wyvern gets involved, if 
reinforcements arrive-they're liabilities."
"You made the right call keeping them as support. But we need to 
be absolutely clear with each other: if things go wrong, we save ourselves 
first. We don't die trying to protect people who signed up knowing the risks."
She meets your eyes. "Can you do that? Because I've seen the way you look at 
them. Like they're people you're responsible for. And that's... good. It's right. 
But it can also get you killed."
 
THE TACTICAL REALITY
"Here's my professional assessment," she continues, slipping into mission-
planning mode:
"Best case: We use their intelligence, identify a perfect opportunity, strike 
when Gharash is isolated, and ghost before anyone realizes what happened. 
Clean, professional, textbook assassination.
Likely case: We identify an opportunity, it's not perfect but it's workable, we 
engage with some complications, and we have to fight our way clear. Messy 
but successful.
Worst case: Gharash is more paranoid than we expect, we can't isolate him, 
and we either abort or push anyway and face overwhelming odds."
She pauses. "I'm prepared for all three. Are you?"
 
HER DEEPER QUESTION
"And here's the thing I keep coming back to..."
She's choosing words carefully. "You've got a fiendish patron. You carry some 
kind of... I don't know, divine protection that I've never asked about because 
you haven't offered to tell me. You've got layers I don't fully understand."
"But tomorrow, when we're in Saltmere, when things get violent-I need to 
know: Are you all in? Or is there some part of your mind calculating tribute 
payments and patron demands while we're trying to survive?"
It's not accusatory. It's genuine-a partner making sure her partner 
is focused.
"Because if you're not 100% present, if you're wrestling with demonic 
obligations while a wyvern is diving at us, that's when people die."
 
THE OFFER
She softens slightly. "I trust you, Johannes. You've earned that a hundred 
times over. But tomorrow is different. This is command-sanctioned military 
assassination. Stakes are higher. Consequences are bigger."
"So tell me honestly: Are you good? Focused? Ready?"
She grins slightly. "And if you're not, if you need tonight to sort your head 
out, tell me now. I'd rather delay the operation a day than walk into it with 
you distracted."
 
SHE WAITS
The sun is setting behind the hills, painting everything gold and crimson. 
Haven's lights are beginning to glow as evening settles in.
Kessa stands beside you, your partner, your friend, genuinely checking to 
make sure you're ready for what's coming.
How do you respond?
Do you:
*	Reassure her you're focused and ready?
*	Admit concerns about the mission?
*	Tell her about the Disks and your promise to Khisanth?
*	Discuss the patron situation more openly?
*	Something else?
This feels like an important moment between you two.
Hmm, Kessa knows about the disks. She was there and part of the 
conversation. The support team stays out of Saltmere. Whatever distracting 
they do is in the land outside the town. We don't involve anyone other than 
ourselves and our plan is to retreat to Solace or somewhere other than 
Haven't for the winter.
Dec 6
CLARIFICATION & CORRECTION
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT
My apologies-Kessa was absolutely there during the Xak Tsaroth encounter 
with Khisanth. She knows about the Disks of Mishakal and your promise to 
find them a worthy wielder. Let me correct that.
And you're right about the tactical plan-Garrett's team stays outside 
Saltmere, providing intelligence and external support/distractions, not 
entering the city itself.
 
REVISED CONVERSATION
Kessa's actual concern then becomes:
"Johannes, I'm focused. Question is-are you?"
She leans on the wall, watching the sunset. "We've got the Disks sitting in the 
bag, waiting for you to decide who's worthy. We've got Laurana running a real 
resistance. We've got your patron still expecting tribute eventually."
"Tomorrow we're walking into an assassination that could change 
everything-or get us killed. And after that?" She looks at you. "You mentioned 
retreating to Solace for winter. Not Haven."
She's not judging-she's clarifying the plan.
"Are we thinking this through? We hit Gharash, succeed or fail, and then... we 
leave? Don't stick around to help Haven through whatever retaliation comes? 
Or are you thinking we use Solace as a base but stay engaged?"
She turns to face you directly. "I'm with you either way. I just want to make 
sure you know what you're planning. Because Laurana is treating us like we're 
joining her resistance long-term. But it sounds like you're thinking more... 
mobile? Hit and run from different bases?"
 
THE REAL QUESTIONS
Kessa gets to the heart of it:
"One: Are you ready to kill Gharash tomorrow? Focused, clear-headed, 
committed?
Two: What's the actual plan after? Do we return to Haven or disappear to 
Solace?
Three: Are you any closer to deciding about the Disks? Because Laurana 
might actually be worthy-she's building something real. Or are you waiting 
for something else?
Four: The patron-is the tribute timeline pressuring any of these decisions?"
She spreads her hands. "I trust your judgment, Johannes. I just want to make 
sure you've actually made the judgments, rather than letting things pile up 
while we keep moving forward."
 
YOUR RESPONSE?
What's your actual thinking on:
1.	Tomorrow's mission - Are you ready and focused?
2.	Post-operation plan - Haven vs. Solace, long-term vs. mobile?
3.	The Disks - Any closer to a decision on Laurana's worthiness?
4.	The patron's timeline - How much time do you have before tribute is 
due?
Kessa is giving you space to think out loud, organize your thoughts, 
and clarify the path forward.
No, I'm being realistic. A trail leading to Haven is a death sentence from 
Verminaard. Heading somewhere else minimizes their exposure. We'll tell 
Laurana before we leave and besides, the same after this will be too great to 
do anything else in the field this season, so heading in a dissent direction 
really doesn't hurt us or them.
Dec 6
STRATEGIC CLARITY
KESSA'S UNDERSTANDING
"Ah." She nods immediately, getting it. "You're protecting Haven 
by not returning there. Smart."
She thinks it through out loud: "We kill Gharash in Saltmere. Dragon Army 
investigates. They're already looking for whoever hit the warehouse-now 
their regional commander is dead too. If we go back to Haven, any trail leads 
straight to the resistance's main base."
"But if we disappear to Solace or somewhere else entirely? The trail goes cold. 
Verminaard wastes resources hunting ghosts in the wrong direction. Haven 
stays off the primary target list."
She grins. "And you're right-winter's coming. After an operation this big, 
the heat will be too intense for field work anyway. Better to lay low, let things 
cool down, plan the next move for spring."
 
THE REALITY CHECK
"So the actual plan is:
Phase 1: Kill Gharash in Saltmere Phase 2: Extract by sea (Captain Marna's 
ship) Phase 3: Brief return to Haven to report success and resupply Phase 
4: Disappear to Solace or elsewhere for winter Phase 5: Spring coordination 
with Haven for next operations
Meanwhile, Haven gets the benefit of Gharash being dead, our gold funding 
their winter preparations, and plausible deniability when Dragon Army 
investigators come asking questions."
She looks at you seriously. "Does Laurana know this is the plan? Because she's 
definitely talking like we're joining her command structure long-term."
 
KESSA'S TACTICAL ASSESSMENT
"From a pure survival standpoint, you're absolutely right. The best thing for 
Haven is for us to not be there when Verminaard sends investigators."
"We're the weapons that struck. Weapons don't stay at the armory-they get 
stored somewhere safe until needed again."
She pauses. "Though I wonder if Laurana will see it that way, or if she'll feel 
like we're using Haven's resources and then abandoning them."
She shrugs. "Not that it matters if she's upset. You're making the tactically 
sound choice. I just want you prepared for the conversation when we tell her."
 
THE PATRON TIMELINE
"Speaking of timelines-how much time do you actually have before your 
patron expects tribute? Because that might affect whether we stay in Solace all 
winter or if we need to be hunting for artifacts."
She looks at you seriously. "The Disks protect you for now. But eventually 
you'll have to hand them over to whoever's worthy, and then you're back to 
raw exposure unless we've found another solution."
 
FOCUS CHECK
"But all that is after tomorrow. Right now, the question is simple:"
She meets your eyes directly. "Are you ready to kill Gharash? Clear head, 
focused intent, no distractions?"
She's not doubting you-she's doing the pre-mission check a good 
partner does.
"Because I am. I'm focused. I trust our capabilities. I trust Garrett's intel. I 
trust that we can pull this off."
"I just need to hear you say you're in the same headspace."
 
THE MOMENT
The sun has fully set now. Haven's lights glow warmly below. Tomorrow you 
deploy.
Your response?
And after you confirm you're ready, do you want to:
1.	Rest for tomorrow
2.	Talk to Laurana about the post-mission plan tonight
3.	Do any final preparation
4.	Something else
What's your call?
Did kressa forget about the mind protection ring and keeping me from 
getting used to the Disks? And that wet just gave tribute to the Patron and I 
have a year until next payment?
I'll go talk with Lausanne and make plans for the post operation and what i 
should expect for next spring. Garrett could leave the sending stone in a cache 
for us to collect when they pull out before the assassination so we can 
coordinate from Solace.
Dec 6
KESSA'S CORRECTION
HER EMBARRASSED LAUGH
"Right, gods, I'm an idiot." She shakes her head. "You've got the Ring of 
Mind Shielding now-mental protection independent of the Disks. That's 
exactly why you're wearing it instead of keeping it as trade goods."
She taps her forehead. "Pre-mission jitters making me forget the actual facts. 
You're protected. The Disks can go to whoever's worthy without leaving you 
exposed."
"And you just paid tribute-what, a month ago? Two? You've got nearly a full 
year before the next payment is due." She relaxes visibly. "So there's no time 
pressure. We can winter in Solace, plan properly for spring, not rush into 
stupid decisions."
She looks sheepish. "Sorry. I was catastrophizing problems that don't 
actually exist. You're in a better position than I was giving you credit for."
 
THE SOLACE PLAN
"Alright, so here's the actual situation:
*	You're mentally protected (Ring)
*	You've got time before tribute (nearly a year)
*	The Disks can go to Laurana or whoever without compromising you
*	We winter in Solace after Gharash
*	We coordinate with Haven for spring operations
That's... actually a solid plan. Strategic, safe, gives Haven plausible 
deniability."
She nods approvingly. "And the sending stone cache idea is brilliant. Garrett 
leaves it hidden before we strike. After the operation, Haven collects it. We 
pick ours up from a separate cache. No direct contact, no trail leading back to 
us, but we maintain communication for spring coordination."
 
TALKING TO LAURANA
"Go talk to her tonight," Kessa says. "She needs to understand this isn't 
abandonment-it's protecting her. We're the smoking gun. The further we 
are from Haven when investigators arrive, the safer everyone is."
She grins. "Plus, if she understands we're coming back in spring, she can plan 
operations around our capabilities. We're not disappearing-we're 
repositioning."
 
FINDING LAURANA
You make your way to the command center. Laurana is still there, working late 
over maps and supply reports by lamplight.
She looks up as you enter. "Johannes. Can't sleep either?"
She gestures to a chair. "Join me. I find the night before an operation is 
when the clearest thinking happens-or the worst anxiety. Which is it for 
you?"
 
THE CONVERSATION
How do you want to frame this?
The key points to cover:
1.	Post-operation plan: Disappearing to Solace (not Haven) to protect 
them
2.	Why: Keeping trails away from Haven's main base
3.	Communication: Sending stone cache system for spring coordination
4.	Timeline: Winter in Solace, resume coordination in spring
5.	Reassurance: This isn't abandonment, it's strategic positioning
And potentially:
*	The Disks of Mishakal (if you've decided she's worthy)
*	Your actual long-term goals
*	How much you reveal about your patron situation
What's your approach with Laurana?
No. One Stone stays here so they know how the mission goes. The other stone 
goes with Garrett to communicate/coordinate until the mission starts, then he 
and the others pull out of town and leave the Stone for us to pick up on our 
way to Solace so we can coordinate with Haven over the winter months...
Dec 6
CORRECTED SENDING STONE PLAN
YOU'RE RIGHT - MUCH BETTER
Let me get this straight:
Stone 1 (Laurana keeps):
*	Stays at Haven command
*	Receives updates during mission from Garrett
*	Eventually receives updates from you once you retrieve Stone 2
Stone 2 (Garrett carries initially):
*	Goes to Saltmere with Garrett's team
*	Used for mission coordination/intelligence updates to Laurana
*	Before the assassination, Garrett's team pulls out and caches Stone 
2 in a predetermined location
*	You retrieve it after the operation on your way to Solace
*	Allows you to maintain communication with Haven all winter without 
physical contact
This is brilliant because:
*	Laurana gets real-time mission updates from Garrett
*	No communication gap during the operation
*	You maintain coordination capability without returning to Haven
*	No trail connects you to Haven after the strike
*	Perfect operational security
 
CONVERSATION WITH LAURANA
She looks up from her maps as you enter. "Johannes. Can't sleep either?"
You sit across from her and lay out the plan:
"Commander, we need to discuss post-operation logistics."
 
How do you explain:
1.	Why you're not returning to Haven (protecting them from 
investigation trails)
2.	The sending stone communication plan (Garrett updates during 
mission, then you retrieve stone for winter coordination)
3.	Wintering in Solace (laying low while heat dies down)
4.	Spring coordination (you're not disappearing, just repositioning)
5.	The benefit to Haven (plausible deniability when Dragon Army 
investigates)
What's your pitch to Laurana?
All of the above.
Dec 6
THE STRATEGIC BRIEF
LAYING IT OUT
You lean forward, meeting Laurana's eyes directly-commander to 
commander.
"After we kill Gharash, Kessa and I won't be returning to Haven. We'll be 
heading to Solace for the winter."
Laurana's expression shifts-surprise, perhaps concern. You 
continue before she can object:
 
THE REASONING
"When Gharash dies, Verminaard will investigate. Hard. They'll tear apart 
Saltmere looking for who did it. They'll interrogate survivors, trace 
movements, hunt for any trail."
You tap the map. "If that trail leads back to Haven-to this resistance, to these 
refugees, to your command structure-Verminaard sends dragons. He sends 
Highlords. He ends this place and everyone in it."
"But if Kessa and I disappear to Solace? The trail goes cold in a completely 
different direction. Haven becomes just another refugee settlement. Plausible 
deniability. You can honestly say you don't know who killed their 
commander."
Laurana's expression shifts to understanding, but she's listening 
carefully.
 
THE COMMUNICATION PLAN
"We're not abandoning you. We're protecting you and maintaining 
coordination. Here's how:"
You explain methodically:
"During the operation: Garrett carries one sending stone, you keep the 
other. He provides real-time intelligence updates-Gharash's location, our 
progress, mission status. You know what's happening as it happens.
Before the assassination: Garrett and his team pull out of Saltmere 
completely. They're support and intelligence, not combatants. They cache the 
sending stone at a predetermined location outside the city.
After we kill Gharash: Kessa and I extract by sea as planned, retrieve the 
cached stone on our way to Solace, and continue coordination with you 
throughout the winter.
Result: You maintain communication with us. We can coordinate spring 
operations, share intelligence, plan targets. But there's no physical trail 
connecting us to Haven. No visits, no witnesses, no evidence."
 
THE WINTER STRATEGY
"Realistically, after an operation this big, the heat will be too intense for field 
work anyway. Dragon Army will be swarming. Winter's coming. It's time to 
consolidate, resupply, and plan."
You gesture to her supply reports. "Haven uses our gold to prepare for winter, 
fortify defenses, train recruits. You build strength while staying off 
Verminaard's primary target list.
Meanwhile, Kessa and I winter in Solace-different region, different 
investigators, different trail. We gather intelligence, make contacts, identify 
targets for spring.
When spring comes, we coordinate through the sending stones. You 
identify strategic targets based on Haven's needs. We hit them with precision. 
The resistance expands without exposing your main base."
 
THE BENEFIT TO HAVEN
"Think about what Dragon Army investigators will find:
At Saltmere: Destroyed warehouse, dead Harbor Master, missing 
commander. No clear culprits, no witnesses who saw the killers clearly, trails 
going in multiple directions.
At Haven: A refugee settlement with legitimate defensive concerns, no 
obvious connection to Saltmere events, led by a displaced elven princess 
organizing survival-not assassination.
The story writes itself: Gharash was killed by unknown forces-maybe 
rival Dragon Army factions, maybe independent operators, maybe remnants 
of destroyed resistance cells. Haven stays below the threshold of 'requires 
immediate elimination.'"
 
THE SPRING COORDINATION
"Come spring, we're not starting from scratch. We have communication. We 
have shared intelligence. We have coordinated strategy.
You can send word: 'Dragon Army is moving supplies through X route' or 
'Prison camp at Y needs liberating' or 'Commander Z is vulnerable.'
We hit the target. The resistance benefits. Haven maintains plausible 
deniability. We repeat."
You lean back. "We become your mobile strike force-too dangerous to ignore, 
too elusive to catch, always hitting where Verminaard is weak."
 
THE PERSONAL TOUCH
"Laurana, I've seen what you're building here. It's real. It's organized. It's what 
resistance should look like-not scattered survivors hiding in the woods, but 
coordinated operations with strategic vision."
You meet her eyes. "We're not running away. We're not using your resources 
and disappearing. We're protecting what you've built by keeping the Dragon 
Army's attention away from it while continuing to hurt their operations 
from a different angle."
A pause. "In spring, when things have cooled down and we've planned 
properly, we can reassess. Maybe it's safe to operate more closely with Haven. 
Maybe we identify a target that requires direct coordination. But for winter, 
after killing Gharash?"
"The smartest move is distance."
 
LAURANA'S REACTION
She's quiet for a long moment, processing. Her fingers trace routes on the 
map, thinking through the logic.
Finally, she looks up.
"You're right." Simple, direct acknowledgment. "If Gharash dies and you 
return here, you paint a target on everyone in Haven. But if you vanish to 
Solace..."
She nods slowly. "Verminaard wastes resources hunting in the wrong 
direction. Haven survives winter. We maintain communication and 
coordination. Spring brings new opportunities."
She extends her hand. "Strategic thinking. I appreciate the honesty-you 
could have just disappeared without explanation. Instead, you're ensuring we 
understand the plan and maintain capability."
A slight smile. "And the sending stone system is clever. Garrett feeds me real-
time updates during the operation, then you maintain winter coordination 
without physical contact. Clean."
 
HER QUESTIONS
"A few practical details:
One: Where exactly does Garrett cache the stone? We need a location you can 
find reliably but Dragon Army won't stumble across.
Two: Spring timeline-when do we resume active coordination? Early spring 
when passes clear, or later when you've gathered intelligence?
Three: What do I tell the people here? Garrett's group knows you're leading 
this operation. Others have heard about the 'Saltmere liberators.' When you 
don't return, there will be questions."
She leans forward. "I'll support the plan-I just need to know how to explain it 
without undermining morale or making people think you abandoned us."
 
YOUR RESPONSE?
What are your answers to:
1.	Cache location for the sending stone (specific landmark between 
Saltmere and Solace?)
2.	Spring timeline for resuming coordination
3.	The cover story - what should Laurana tell Haven's people about your 
departure?
And is there anything else you want to discuss with her before 
tomorrow's operation?
These aren't details I'm interested in addressing.
Dec 7
FINALIZING THE PLAN
LAURANA'S ACCEPTANCE
"Understood. We'll work out the tactical details-cache locations, timelines, 
cover stories-based on how the operation actually unfolds. No point planning 
every detail when the situation is fluid."
She stands, offering her hand again. "You've given me what I need: strategic 
clarity and honest communication. The rest we'll handle as professionals."
Her grip is firm. "Kill Gharash. Extract safely. We'll coordinate the rest 
through Garrett and the sending stones."
She pauses at the door. "And Johannes? Thank you. For the honesty, for the 
strategic thinking, and for understanding that sometimes the best way to help 
is to stay away."
A slight smile. "Good hunting tomorrow."
 
THE NIGHT BEFORE
You return to your quarters. Kessa is already there, organizing gear for 
tomorrow.
"How'd it go with Laurana?"
When you explain, she nods approvingly. "Good. Clean plan, professional 
execution, everyone understands their role."
She sets down the gear. "We should sleep. Tomorrow's going to be intense."
 
DAWN DEPLOYMENT
Ready to begin Operation Gharash?
Or is there anything else you want to handle tonight before the mission 
begins?
What race is Kressa?
Dec 7
KESSA'S HERITAGE
EXCELLENT QUESTION
Looking back through our campaign, I don't think I've ever explicitly stated 
Kessa's race! Let me establish this properly.
Given her skill set, background, and characterization:
Kessa "Keys" Darrow is a Half-Elf.
This fits because:
*	Darkvision (60 feet) - useful for her rogue work
*	Fey Ancestry - advantage vs. charm, can't be magically put to sleep
*	Lifespan - Long enough to have developed extensive experience
*	Social adaptability - Half-elves blend in many cultures (perfect for a 
rogue/bard)
*	Skill versatility - Half-elves get extra skill proficiencies
Physical description:
*	Late twenties in appearance
*	Dark hair, typically tied back practically
*	Elven features softened by human heritage
*	Lean, athletic build
*	Moves with fluid grace (both elven and trained)
 
DOES THIS WORK?
Or did you have a different vision for her? I'm happy to adjust if you imagined 
her differently!
Is half-elf good, or would you prefer:
*	Human
*	Full elf
*	Another race entirely
What's your preference?
No preference. That totally works
Dec 7
DAWN - OPERATION GHARASH
THE MORNING
You wake before first light. Kessa is already up, checking her weapons with the 
practiced efficiency of someone who's done this many times before.
The half-elf looks up as you stir. "Slept well?"
Outside, Haven is beginning to stir. You can hear the sounds of the city 
waking-but also the sounds of your strike team assembling.
 
FINAL PREPARATIONS
In the courtyard, Garrett's team waits:
*	Garrett - carrying the sending stone, determined expression
*	Finn and Cole - his brothers, nervous but resolved
*	Tomms and Olev - former guards, checking gear
*	Rickard - the grizzled veteran, calm and professional
Laurana and Captain Morna see you off:
"Garrett has the stone," Laurana confirms. "He'll update me as intelligence 
develops. When his team pulls out, they'll cache it for your retrieval."
Captain Morna adds: "The extraction ship will be positioned north of 
Saltmere-Captain Andra commands it. Fast sloop, experienced crew. Signal 
with three flares when you need pickup."
 
THE DEPARTURE
Thoric Ironforge provides final supplies:
*	Alchemist's fire (2 flasks)
*	Signal flares (3)
*	Healing kits
*	Dark travel cloaks
"Strike hard, strike clean, get out alive," the dwarf says simply.
 
THE JOURNEY BEGINS
Your group departs Haven as the sun rises. Eight people heading south toward 
Saltmere:
Phase 1: Intelligence Gathering (Day 1-2) Phase 2: Strike Planning 
(Day 2-3) 
Phase 3: Execution (Day 3) Phase 4: Extraction
 
TO SALTMERE
Ready to begin the operation?
Or is there anything you want to address before we transition into the mission 
itself?
Nope, let's go.
Dec 7
OPERATION GHARASH - DAY 1
THE APPROACH TO SALTMERE
Two days of travel bring you within sight of the port city. You stop at a wooded 
ridge overlooking the approach-far enough to avoid patrols, close enough to 
observe.
Perception Check (Johannes): 17 + 1 = 18 Perception Check 
(Kessa): 19 + 4 = 23
Even from this distance, the changes are obvious:
 
SALTMERE UNDER OCCUPATION
What you see:
The Harbor:
*	Dragon Army ships now patrol the waters
*	The Iron Tide is docked (Captain Drevik's vessel)
*	Two military transport vessels (reinforcements)
*	The eastern docks remain destroyed (your handiwork - blackened 
timbers, collapsed warehouse)
The City:
*	Increased guard presence on walls and gates
*	Checkpoints at major intersections (visible even from here)
*	Dragon Army banners flying from key buildings
*	Smoke rising from what looks like... a command post being established
Activity Level:
*	Patrols moving in organized patterns
*	Civilian traffic restricted
*	Clear signs of martial law
Kessa whistles softly. "They're not investigating. They're occupying. 
Gharash didn't just come to look around-he's dug in."
 
GARRETT'S INTELLIGENCE
Rickard studies the city through a spyglass. "That's Gharash's pattern. When 
something goes wrong, he doesn't just investigate-he takes control. 
Probably declared martial law, assumed direct command of local forces, 
turned Saltmere into a temporary military garrison."
Garrett adds: "Which means getting in and out just got harder. But it also 
means we know where he is-he'll be at the command post, coordinating the 
occupation."
 
MAKING CONTACT - MIRA THE ALCHEMIST
Garrett's plan: "Mira's shop is in the merchant district, away from the heavy 
military presence. Finn and I can approach her-we're locals, we 'survived' the 
warehouse fire by not being there that night. If anyone questions us, we're just 
residents trying to resume normal life."
Rickard nods. "Tomms, Olev, and I stay out here with Johannes and Kessa. 
We're the ones who are supposed to be dead. Can't risk being recognized."
Kessa agrees. "Garrett and Finn make contact with Mira, get current 
intelligence on Gharash's location, patterns, security. The rest of us stay 
hidden and plan based on what they learn."
 
GARRETT'S SENDING STONE UPDATE
Before Garrett and Finn depart, Garrett activates the sending stone:
"Commander Brightblade. Arrived Saltmere. City under martial law. 
Gharash established command post. Making contact with local asset for 
intelligence. Will update. Garrett out."
A moment later, Laurana's voice responds through the stone:
"Received. Proceed with caution. Martial law complicates extraction. 
Captain Andra's ship standing by. Update when you have actionable 
intelligence. Brightblade out."
 
INFILTRATION - GARRETT AND FINN
Stealth Check (Garrett): 12 + 2 = 14 Stealth Check (Finn): 15 + 3 = 18
The two brothers approach Saltmere carefully, using back roads and timing 
their approach to avoid patrols. They're locals-they know these paths.
You watch from the ridge through Rickard's spyglass as they 
disappear into the city's outskirts.
 
THE WAIT
Four hours pass. The sun climbs toward midday.
Kessa keeps watch on patrol patterns. "They're running tight rotations. 
Six-person squads, overlapping coverage, commanders checking in regularly. 
This isn't sloppy occupation-this is professional."
Rickard confirms: "That's Gharash. He doesn't tolerate slack discipline. 
Every guard knows they're being watched, evaluated, tested."
Cole asks nervously: "What if Garrett and Finn get caught?"
Tomms answers quietly: "Then we abort. No rescue attempts-too many 
guards, too organized. We pull back to the extraction point and report failure 
to Commander Brightblade."
Olev adds grimly: "And hope Garrett doesn't break under interrogation and 
give up our position."
 
THE RETURN
Just before dusk, you spot movement-Garrett and Finn, returning via the 
same route. They're moving quickly but not frantically. Controlled urgency.
They reach your position, breathing hard.
Garrett immediately reports:
 
INTELLIGENCE BRIEF - MIRA'S INFORMATION
"Mira's alive and cooperative. Here's what we learned:
Gharash's Location:
*	Command post established in the Harbor Master's 
building (ironic-Voss's old headquarters)
*	Second floor converted to command center
*	Gharash sleeps in reinforced quarters on third floor
*	Twelve elite guards rotate shifts (six on duty, six resting)
*	The wyvern is tethered on the building's roof
Daily Pattern:
*	Morning: Inspects reconstruction efforts and interrogates witnesses
*	Midday: Command briefings with officers
*	Afternoon: Personal inspection tours (various locations, unpredictable 
routes)
*	Evening: Reviews intelligence reports
*	Night: Secured in quarters, heavy guard presence
Current Investigation Status:
*	Dragon Army believes warehouse explosion was accidental (munitions 
mishandling)
*	The staged 'dead guards' story worked-they think it was tragic 
incompetence
*	BUT Gharash is suspicious-he doesn't believe in convenient accidents
*	He's ordered investigation into Voss's finances, contacts, possible 
enemies
Security Measures:
*	Martial law allows arrest without cause
*	Checkpoints at all major intersections
*	Curfew after dark (civilians indoors, violators imprisoned)
*	Wyvern conducts aerial patrols twice daily
Vulnerabilities Identified:
*	Gharash's afternoon inspection tours take him away from the command 
post
*	Only 3-4 guards accompany him during inspections (rest stay at post)
*	His route varies, but Mira says he always inspects the destroyed 
warehouse (obsession with understanding what happened)
*	The inspection happens between second and third bell (roughly 2-3 
PM)
Mira's Offer:
*	Can provide poisons if needed
*	Knows a warehouse near the docks (abandoned) for staging
*	Willing to create a distraction if timing is coordinated
*	Wants payment: 50 gold (she's risking her neck)
 
FINN ADDS CRUCIAL DETAIL
"The destroyed warehouse area is mostly cleared now, but still restricted. 
Gharash goes there with minimal guard presence because it's 'secure 
territory'-no civilians allowed, other guards manning the perimeter."
"If we could get into position there before he arrives for his inspection..."
He looks at Johannes and Kessa. "You two could be waiting. Ambush him 
when he's focused on the ruins, only 3-4 guards present, wyvern back at the 
command post."
 
RICKARD'S TACTICAL ASSESSMENT
"It's our best shot. The command post is too fortified-twelve guards, wyvern 
on the roof, reinforced building. We'd never get in clean.
But during his inspection tour? Three or four guards, open terrain, his 
attention on investigation rather than security?"
The veteran nods. "That's when he's vulnerable."
 
THE PLAN TAKES SHAPE
Kessa looks at you. "We infiltrate the restricted warehouse area before his 
inspection. Set up ambush positions. When Gharash arrives with his small 
guard detail..."
She doesn't finish-doesn't need to.
Garrett continues: "Mira can create a distraction on the other side of the 
docks-draw the perimeter guards' attention for a crucial five minutes. Gives 
you the window to strike and extract before reinforcements arrive."
 
SENDING STONE UPDATE
Garrett activates the stone again:
"Brightblade. Have actionable intelligence. Gharash vulnerable during 
afternoon inspection tours. Targeting tomorrow, second bell. Minimal guard 
presence. Strike team ready. Garrett."
Laurana's response comes quickly:
"Confirmed. Extraction ship repositioning for rapid pickup. Captain Andra 
ready. You have authorization. Strike hard. Good hunting. Brightblade out."
 
THE DECISION POINT
Tomorrow afternoon. Second to third bell. The destroyed 
warehouse.
Current status:
*	Day 1 complete: Intelligence gathered
*	Day 2 (tomorrow): Execute strike
*	Resources available: Mira's support (50 gold), abandoned 
warehouse for staging, distraction capability
The team looks to you for final planning:
Questions to resolve:
1.	Do you pay Mira the 50 gold for her support? (poison, 
distraction, staging location)
2.	Infiltration approach: How do you and Kessa get into the restricted 
warehouse area undetected?
3.	Ambush positioning: Where exactly do you set up to maximize 
surprise?
4.	Support team role: Where do Garrett's people position? (They're 
staying outside Saltmere)
5.	Extraction plan: How do you get from warehouse to Captain Andra's 
ship after the kill?
6.	Contingencies: What if Gharash doesn't show, or brings more guards, 
or the wyvern arrives?
 
What's your tactical plan, Johannes?
Buy more gillyweed from Mira, get into the warehouse tonight under cover of 
darkness, and set up for the assassination. The others have done their job and 
should get out. We need to forge documents explaining why we're coming 
into town, since we're not locals to get through the checkpoint, then meet up 
with Mira. She already knows us. Maybe set up the distraction, then head to 
Haven before anything happens? Give her 70 gold (50 for job, 20 for silly weed 
and inconvenience...)
Dec 7
OPERATION PLANNING - NIGHT 
BEFORE
THE PLAN SOLIDIFIES
You lay it out methodically:
"Garrett, your team is done. You've provided the intelligence we 
needed-perfectly. Now you get out. Tonight. Before anything 
happens."
Garrett starts to protest, but you cut him off. "You're not abandoning us. 
You're completing your mission. Get clear of Saltmere, cache the sending 
stone at the predetermined location, and return to Haven. Report success on 
intelligence gathering."
Rickard nods approvingly. "Smart. We're liabilities now-locals who 
might be recognized, 'dead' men who can't afford to be seen. You two are 
unknown faces who can move freely."
 
MIRA'S SUPPORT
"Finn, one more trip to Mira before you leave. Here's what we 
need:
You count out 70 gold pieces.
"Tell her:
*	50 gold for the job as agreed
*	20 gold for gillyweed (enough for two people) and her inconvenience
*	We need her to set up the distraction tomorrow at second bell
*	After she sets it in motion, she should leave Saltmere-get out before 
anything happens
*	If questioned later, she knows nothing about the actual strike"
Finn takes the gold. "Gillyweed for swimming in? Same as you used 
before?"
"Exactly. Kessa and I swim into position tonight, under cover of darkness. No 
checkpoints, no patrols, no witnesses."
 
FORGED DOCUMENTS
Kessa pulls out Voss's seal and papers from your haul. "We've got his 
official letterhead, his seal, quality parchment. I can forge travel documents."
Forgery Check (Kessa with Voss's materials): 18 + 7 (Deception 
expertise) = 25
She works quickly, creating two sets of documents:
"By order of the late Harbor Master Voss (gods rest him), these merchants 
are authorized to conduct business in Saltmere regarding warehouse 
reconstruction contracts. All guards are to provide assistance and access as 
needed. - Signed, Harbor Master's Office"
"Dated a week ago," she explains. "Before Voss died, before Gharash arrived. 
Official enough that checkpoint guards won't question it, vague enough that 
we're not tied to anything specific."
She grins. "And if they ask why we're coming to Saltmere now? We were 
delayed by road conditions. We only just heard about the 'tragic warehouse 
accident' and came to offer reconstruction services."
 
GARRETT'S TEAM DEPARTURE
Garrett clasps your hand firmly. "We'll cache the stone exactly where we 
discussed. When you're done-when Gharash is dead-you'll find it waiting."
Tomms adds: "We'll tell Commander Brightblade the strike team is in 
position and proceeding."
Olev grins nervously. "Try not to die. I want to hear this story told properly 
in Haven's taverns."
Rickard-the veteran-speaks last: "I served under Gharash for two 
years. Hated every day of it. Watching good people suffer while following his 
orders."
He meets your eyes. "End him. For everyone he's enslaved, tortured, and 
killed. Make it hurt."
They disappear into the dusk, heading north away from Saltmere.
 
FINN'S FINAL RUN - MIRA'S SHOP
Stealth Check (Finn): 16 + 3 = 19
Finn slips into Saltmere one last time as darkness falls. Two hours later, he 
returns with a leather pouch.
"Mira sends her regards." He hands over the gillyweed-enough for two 
people, several hours of water breathing. "She'll create the distraction 
tomorrow at second bell. Something involving alchemical smoke near the 
north docks-draw guards away from the warehouse area."
"And she's leaving town tomorrow evening, heading to her sister's place 
inland. She wants no part of what happens after."
He looks at you seriously. "She said to tell you: 'The dragon-men have had 
this coming. Make it count.'"
 
FINN'S DEPARTURE
"That's it then." Finn grips your hand. "We're out. Stone will be cached. Haven 
will know you're proceeding."
He pauses. "Johannes, Kessa-thank you. For everything. For freeing us, for 
trusting us with this mission, for giving us a chance to matter."
And then he's gone, following his brother and the others north into 
the darkness.
 
ALONE WITH KESSA
It's just the two of you now. The ridge overlooks Saltmere-guard patrols 
visible as moving torches, the harbor lit by lamplight, the ruined warehouse a 
dark scar on the eastern docks.
Kessa checks her gear one final time:
*	+1 Rapier, +1 Hand Crossbow, +1 Dagger
*	Cloak of Elvenkind
*	Potions, tools, rope
*	The forged documents
"We swim in tonight using the gillyweed. Get into the warehouse ruins under 
cover of darkness. Set up ambush positions. Wait for tomorrow afternoon 
when Gharash arrives for his inspection."
She looks at you. "No backup. No support team. No escape plan except our 
own legs and Captain Andra's ship."
A slight smile. "Just like the old days-you, me, and terrible odds."
 
THE SWIM APPROACH - TONIGHT
It's full dark now. Time to move.
You approach the harbor from the north, staying in shadows. The water is 
cold, dark, quiet.
Gillyweed consumed: The familiar sensation-gills forming, webbed 
fingers, water breathing.
Stealth Check (Swimming approach - Johannes): 14 + 2 = 16 Stealth 
Check (Swimming approach - Kessa): 19 + 6 (Stealth expertise + Cloak 
advantage) = 25
You slip into the water like ghosts. No splashing, no noise. The gillyweed does 
its work-breathing underwater feels natural, movement is fluid.
The harbor at night:
*	Guard patrols on docks (torchlight above)
*	Ships at anchor (silhouettes against stars)
*	The destroyed warehouse ahead (dark, restricted, "secured")
You swim beneath the docks, staying deep, using the darkness.
 
INFILTRATING THE WAREHOUSE RUINS
Perception Check (Johannes - underwater): 11 + 1 = 12 Perception 
Check (Kessa - underwater): 18 + 4 = 22
Kessa signals-she's found it. A collapsed section of the warehouse where your 
explosion broke through to the water. The opening is submerged, hidden from 
surface view, perfect for covert entry.
You surface inside the ruins, water dripping, gillyweed effect fading.
Inside the destroyed warehouse:
The space is exactly as you left it-burned timbers, collapsed roof sections, 
charred debris. But now it's been partially cleared:
*	Dragon Army work crews have removed bodies
*	Some structural damage assessed and marked
*	Evidence of investigation (marked areas, measurement stakes)
*	But it's empty at night-no guards inside, just perimeter 
patrols
This is your ambush site.
 
SETTING UP - AMBUSH POSITIONS
You have all night to prepare. Dawn is 8 hours away. Gharash's inspection is 
roughly 14 hours away.
What do you want to set up?
Possible preparations:
*	Ambush positions (high ground, concealment, firing lanes)
*	Escape routes (mark paths, clear debris, prepare exits)
*	Traps or hazards (caltrops, oil slicks, unstable debris)
*	Concealment (places to hide until Gharash arrives)
*	Backup plans (if things go wrong)
Kessa whispers: "We've got time. Let's make this perfect."
How do you prepare the battlefield?
All of the above. If the water entrance we're using is hard to find, maybe we 
do the smart thing, and use it to exit after the job is done. Since I have my 
manta ray cloak, there should be more than enough gillyweed for us to stay 
underwater until dark after the assassination so we can leave undetected?
Dec 7
PREPARING THE KILL ZONE
KESSA'S APPROVAL
"Brilliant." She examines the submerged entrance. "They'll never think to 
watch the water-they're looking for land-based threats. We kill Gharash, slip 
back through here, swim underwater using the gillyweed and your Manta Ray 
Cloak, surface far from the docks after dark, signal Captain Andra."
She grins in the darkness. "Clean, professional, untraceable."
 
PREPARATION - ALL NIGHT
You have 8 hours until dawn, 14 hours until the strike. Time to make this 
perfect.
 
1. AMBUSH POSITIONS
Investigation Check (Johannes): 15 + 1 = 16 Investigation Check 
(Kessa): 21 + 5 = 26
Kessa identifies the optimal setup:
Position Alpha (Kessa):
*	Elevated position in collapsed second-floor section
*	30 feet up, overlooking the main inspection area
*	Clear firing lanes with hand crossbow
*	Rubble provides hard cover
*	Escape route down to water entrance marked with subtle chalk
Position Beta (Johannes):
*	Ground level, behind scorched support beam
*	Perfect angle for Eldritch Blast (60+ feet range)
*	Shadow-heavy area (One with Shadows invisibility ready)
*	Direct line to water entrance (20 feet sprint)
The Kill Zone:
*	Central area where Gharash will stand to inspect damage
*	40 feet from your position, 35 feet from Kessa's
*	No cover for him-deliberate clearing by investigation crews
*	His guards will fan out to perimeter (standard security pattern)
 
2. ESCAPE ROUTES
You mark three paths with subtle scratches visible only if you know to look:
Primary: Your positions ? Water entrance (underwater 
exit) Secondary: North wall breach ? Alley system (if water route 
compromised) Tertiary: Roof access ? Adjacent building (absolute 
emergency)
You clear debris along each route-quiet movement paths, no creaking boards.
 
3. TRAPS & HAZARDS
Using materials from Haven's kit and the warehouse debris:
Caltrops:
*	Scattered along southern approach (slows reinforcements)
*	Hidden under ash and debris (not visible to casual inspection)
Oil Slick:
*	Alchemist's fire positioned near guard positions
*	If things go wrong, you can ignite and create fire barrier
Unstable Debris:
*	Weakened beam rigged to collapse if pulled (blocks pursuit route)
*	Rope attached, ready to yank from your position
The beauty: Everything looks natural-fire damage, investigation work, 
structural instability. No obvious traps.
 
4. CONCEALMENT
For Kessa (elevated position):
*	Drapes burned canvas around her perch
*	Looks like debris accumulation
*	Cloak of Elvenkind provides advantage on Stealth
*	She'll be invisible until she attacks
For Johannes (ground level):
*	Shadow-heavy corner created by angling debris
*	One with Shadows = invisible in dim light/darkness
*	Positioning allows you to see Gharash but remain unseen
*	Devil's Sight lets you see perfectly while hidden in darkness
You test sightlines: From where Gharash will stand, neither position is 
visible. Perfect.
 
5. BACKUP PLANS
If Gharash brings more guards than expected:
*	Abort signal: Kessa whistles twice (sounds like wind through ruins)
*	Both retreat to water, underwater until nightfall
*	Live to try another day
If the wyvern arrives:
*	Shadow of Moil (yourself in flame-darkness, attacks have disadvantage)
*	Kessa focuses fire on wyvern's wings
*	Emergency Dimension Door scroll if absolutely necessary
If you're discovered before Gharash arrives:
*	Kessa creates distraction, runs to secondary escape
*	You go invisible (One with Shadows), slip to water
*	Rendezvous at Captain Andra's ship
If extraction is compromised:
*	Overland route to fallback position (marked on stolen maps)
*	Three days of rations hidden in waterproof cache near water entrance
*	Garrett's cached sending stone for emergency Haven contact
 
DAWN APPROACHES
Survival Check (finding concealment for the day): 14 + 1 = 15
You and Kessa hide in your prepared positions as dawn breaks. The 
warehouse ruins remain empty-no guard patrols inside the restricted zone, 
just perimeter watches.
You settle in to wait.
 
THE WAITING - MORNING TO AFTERNOON
First Bell (9 AM): Guard shift change at perimeter. New patrols, but none 
enter ruins.
Between First and Second Bell: You hear activity in Saltmere-normal 
city sounds, some military orders being shouted, the wyvern's screech once 
from the command post.
Kessa whispers from her position: "Mira's distraction should start at 
second bell. That's our window."
 
SECOND BELL (2 PM) - MIRA'S DISTRACTION
BOOM.
Alchemical explosion from the north docks-thick colored smoke billowing 
into the sky.
Shouts. Running footsteps. Guards rushing toward the distraction.
The perimeter around your warehouse thins noticeably.
 
GHARASH ARRIVES - 15 MINUTES LATER
Perception Check (Johannes): 16 + 1 = 17 Perception Check 
(Kessa): 20 + 4 = 24
You hear them before you see them:
Heavy armored footsteps. Orders being barked.
Through the ruined entrance, Commander Gharash enters with his 
inspection detail:
 
COMMANDER GHARASH - VISUAL
The man himself:
*	Tall, powerfully built, mid-40s
*	Full plate armor (Dragon Army design, quality craftsmanship)
*	Greatsword on back (well-used, maintained)
*	Commander's insignia and decorations
*	Face scarred, hard, professional soldier's bearing
*	Eyes constantly scanning-paranoid, alert
His escort:
*	Four elite guards in half-plate
*	Longswords, crossbows, disciplined formation
*	They fan out as predicted-perimeter security pattern
*	None are looking up at Kessa's position
*	None can see you in the shadows
 
GHARASH INSPECTS THE RUINS
He walks into your kill zone, examining the blast damage, the collapsed 
sections, the investigation markings.
"Munitions mishandling," he mutters, voice carrying. "That's what they want 
me to believe. Convenient. Too convenient."
He crouches, examining scorched timbers.
"Voss was many things. Corrupt, greedy, ruthless. But careless? Never. This 
wasn't an accident."
One of his guards responds: "Sir, the evidence clearly shows-"
"The evidence shows what someone wanted us to find." Gharash 
stands, anger in his voice. "Someone killed Voss. Destroyed his operation. 
Made it look like incompetence."
He turns, looking around the ruins. His back is to you. 40 feet away. 
Perfect target.
"Whoever did this is still out there. Probably watching. Laughing at how we've 
accepted their cover story."
He has no idea how right he is.
 
INITIATIVE
You and Kessa have complete surprise. Gharash is focused on investigation. 
His guards are watching the perimeter, not the interior.
This is the moment.
How do you initiate the ambush?
Do you:
1.	Both attack simultaneously (coordinated strike)
2.	You hex + blast, Kessa follows up (magical opening)
3.	Kessa snipes first, you follow (ranged assassination)
4.	Cast Shadow of Moil first, then attack (protection before 
engagement)
5.	Something else
And specifically-what are your first actions?
Kessa is ready. Waiting for your signal.
This is it, Johannes. How do you kill Commander Gharash?
Arcana check, magical defenses?
Dec 7
ARCANE ASSESSMENT
ANALYZING THE TARGET
Good instinct. Before committing to the strike, you study Gharash carefully 
from your concealed position, looking for magical protections.
Arcana Check (Johannes): 14 + 3 = 17
 
WHAT YOU DETECT
Gharash is wearing/carrying magical items:
Visible auras (to your trained eye):
1.	The Plate Armor - Faint abjuration magic (likely +1 or enchanted for 
protection)
2.	A ring on his left hand - Moderate abjuration (possibly Ring of 
Protection or similar defensive magic)
3.	An amulet partially visible under his armor - Faint abjuration 
(could be Protection from Energy, or general warding)
What you DON'T detect:
*	No active Shield spell or Mage Armor
*	No Stoneskin or similar damage resistance
*	No Globe of Invulnerability
*	No Death Ward or resurrection contingencies (that you can see)
*	No obvious Alarm or Glyph of Warding spells on his person
 
YOUR ASSESSMENT
He's a fighter with good magical gear, not a spellcaster. His defenses are:
*	High AC from plate armor (likely 19-20 with magical enhancement and 
ring)
*	Good saving throws (fighter chassis)
*	Possible damage reduction or resistance from the amulet
*	But no spell-based defenses that would negate your attacks
Critical insight: He's relying on physical protection and paranoia, not 
magical wards. Your Eldritch Blast will damage him normally (force damage), 
and Kessa's attacks will hit if they beat his AC.
 
TACTICAL RECOMMENDATION
Kessa whispers from her position (she can see you 
analyzing): "Well? What are we looking at?"
Based on your analysis:
*	Hex will work (no immunity to curses visible)
*	Eldritch Blast will deal full damage (force damage bypasses most 
resistances)
*	Maddening Hex psychic damage should work (no mind-blank 
detected)
*	Kessa's sneak attack will work if she hits
*	Shadow of Moil would give you protection if he counterattacks
The guards show no magical auras-standard elite soldiers with good 
equipment but no enchantments.
 
THE MOMENT HOLDS
Gharash is still examining the ruins, back to you, 40 feet away.
His four guards are at the perimeter-two at 60 feet, two at 45 feet, watching 
outward.
Complete surprise. Perfect positioning. Target analyzed.
Now: How do you strike?
What's your opening move?
Concurrent attack on Garash. Hex, EB.
Dec 7
THE ASSASSINATION - SURPRISE 
ROUND
COORDINATED STRIKE
You catch Kessa's eye. She nods, raising her hand crossbow.
You focus on Gharash's back, weaving the Hex curse with silent precision 
while channeling eldritch energy.
Three. Two. One.
 
SURPRISE ROUND - SIMULTANEOUS ATTACK
JOHANNES'S STRIKE
Hex (Bonus Action): The curse settles on Gharash like a shroud of doom. 
Dark tendrils coil around him invisibly.
Eldritch Blast #1:
*	Attack Roll: 17 + 7 = 24 vs AC (likely 19-20) ? HIT
*	Damage: 8 + 4 (Agonizing) = 12 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 5 necrotic damage
*	Total: 17 damage
Eldritch Blast #2:
*	Attack Roll: 13 + 7 = 20 vs AC ? HIT
*	Damage: 6 + 4 (Agonizing) = 10 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 3 necrotic damage
*	Total: 13 damage
TOTAL JOHANNES DAMAGE: 30
Purple-white bolts scream from the shadows, slamming into Gharash's back. 
The plate armor absorbs some impact, but the force damage punches through, 
and the necrotic curse eats at his vitality.
 
KESSA'S STRIKE (SIMULTANEOUS)
+1 Hand Crossbow (Sneak Attack - complete surprise, advantage):
*	Attack Roll (with advantage): 19 + 7 = 26 ? HIT
*	Damage: 5 + 4 = 9 piercing
*	Sneak Attack: 3d6 = 4 + 5 + 2 = 11
*	Total: 20 damage
The crossbow bolt takes him in the neck gap between helmet and armor-a 
perfect shot. Blood sprays.
 
GHARASH'S REACTION
TOTAL DAMAGE: 50 HP
The Commander staggers forward, dropping to one knee. Blood pours from 
the neck wound. He's badly hurt but not down-veteran constitution, 
fighter's endurance.
He roars in pain and fury: "AMBUSH! TO ME!"
His hand goes to his neck, stemming the blood. The other draws his 
greatsword with practiced speed.
His eyes scan the ruins-trying to locate attackers.
Perception Check (Gharash, disadvantage from Hex on ability 
checks):
*	First roll: 14 - 1 (wounded) = 13
*	Second roll (disadvantage): 8 - 1 = 7
*	Result: 7
He sees the general direction of your Eldritch Blast, but he can't pinpoint 
you in the shadows. Kessa's elevated position remains completely hidden.
 
THE GUARDS REACT
Initiative Rolls:
*	Kessa: 17 + 4 = 21
*	Johannes: 13 + 2 = 15
*	Gharash: 11 + 1 (wounded) = 12
*	Elite Guards: 10 + 2 = 12 (tied with Gharash, going after)
Initiative Order:
1.	Kessa (21)
2.	Johannes (15)
3.	Gharash (12)
4.	Elite Guards (12)
 
THE GUARDS' POSITIONS
The four guards turn toward the commotion:
Guard 1 & 2 (60 feet away, near entrance): Drawing weapons, moving 
toward Gharash
Guard 3 & 4 (45 feet away, flanking positions): Raising crossbows, scanning 
for threats
None have clear shots yet-they're reacting, not engaging.
 
ROUND 1 - KESSA'S TURN
Gharash is on one knee, bleeding, searching for threats. The guards are 
converging but not yet in position.
Kessa has another clear shot before they close in.
What does she do?
Options:
*	Reload and shoot Gharash again (finish him)
*	Switch to rapier, drop down for melee (risky)
*	Target a guard instead (tactical)
*	Hold action for specific trigger
I'll handle Kessa's turn unless you want to direct her specifically.
 
YOUR TURN IS COMING
After Kessa acts, it's your turn.
You have:
*	Hex active on Gharash (concentration)
*	2/2 spell slots remaining
*	Perfect shadow concealment (still hidden)
*	40 feet from Gharash
*	Clear line of sight
Gharash is wounded (50 damage taken) but still dangerous. The 
guards are closing in.
What's your plan for Round 1?
Garish. You handle kessa.
Dec 7
ROUND 1 - KESSA'S TURN
FINISHING THE COMMANDER
Kessa doesn't hesitate. Gharash is wounded, bleeding, distracted-perfect 
target.
She reloads with practiced speed and takes careful aim at his neck wound.
+1 Hand Crossbow (Sneak Attack - unseen attacker, advantage):
*	Attack Roll (advantage): 18 + 7 = 25 ? HIT
*	Damage: 6 + 4 = 10 piercing
*	Sneak Attack: 3d6 = 6 + 4 + 3 = 13
*	Total: 23 damage
The bolt punches through the existing wound. Gharash's eyes go wide. Blood 
fountains.
He tries to speak, but only blood comes out. His greatsword clatters to the 
ground.
Commander Gharash collapses face-first into the rubble.
DEAD.
 
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN
The guards see their commander fall. Shock, then rage.
Guard 1 shouts: "THEY KILLED THE COMMANDER! FIND THEM!"
They still haven't pinpointed Kessa's elevated position, but they know roughly 
where your Eldritch Blasts came from.
You're still hidden in shadow, invisible via One with Shadows.
Your options:
Offensive:
*	Eldritch Blast the nearest guards (thin their numbers)
*	Cast Shadow of Moil (protection + advantage on attacks)
*	Maddening Hex bonus action (but Gharash is dead - transfer Hex first?)
Tactical:
*	Start moving toward water exit (40 feet away)
*	Ready action to blast anyone who approaches
*	Create chaos to cover retreat
Defensive:
*	Full retreat to water entrance
*	Go invisible and hold position
The guards are:
*	Guards 1 & 2: 50 feet away, moving toward Gharash's body
*	Guards 3 & 4: 40 feet away, raising crossbows, scanning
What do you do?
He'd to Guard 1, eb
Dec 7
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN 
(CONTINUED)
SHIFTING THE CURSE
Hex Transfer (Bonus Action): The dark curse releases Gharash's corpse 
and coils around Guard 1 like a serpent.
Eldritch Blast - Guard 1:
First Bolt:
*	Attack Roll: 11 + 7 = 18 vs AC 16 (half-plate) ? HIT
*	Damage: 7 + 4 (Agonizing) = 11 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 4 necrotic damage
*	Total: 15 damage
Second Bolt:
*	Attack Roll: 14 + 7 = 21 ? HIT
*	Damage: 9 + 4 (Agonizing) = 13 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 2 necrotic damage
*	Total: 15 damage
TOTAL DAMAGE TO GUARD 1: 30
The elite guard screams as purple-white energy slams into him. The first bolt 
staggers him, the second drops him-lifeless before he hits the ground.
Two down. Three guards remaining.
 
ROUND 1 - GHARASH'S TURN (SKIPPED - DEAD)
The commander's body lies in a spreading pool of blood.
 
ROUND 1 - ELITE GUARDS' TURN
The remaining three guards react:
Guard 2 (near entrance, just saw Guard 1 die beside him):
*	Morale Check: 8 - 2 (commander dead, guard dead) = 6 (FAILS)
*	"DEMONS! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK BY DEMONS!"
*	He runs toward the entrance, fleeing in panic
Guard 3 (40 feet away, has crossbow):
*	Fires at your last known position (you're still invisible in shadows)
*	Attack Roll: 12 + 5 = 17 vs your position (but you're unseen - 
disadvantage)
*	Second roll (disadvantage): 6 + 5 = 11
*	MISSES - bolt clatters harmlessly into debris
Guard 4 (45 feet away, has crossbow):
*	Also fires at your general area
*	Attack Roll (disadvantage): 9 + 5 = 14 (miss)
*	Second roll: 5 + 5 = 10
*	MISSES - another bolt goes wide
They're shooting blind at shadows and muzzle flash.
 
ROUND 1 COMPLETE - BATTLEFIELD STATUS
Friendlies:
*	Johannes: Hidden in shadows, invisible, 2/2 spell slots, Hex active on 
Guard 3
*	Kessa: Elevated position, still concealed, loaded crossbow
Enemies:
*	Gharash: DEAD
*	Guard 1: DEAD (30 damage from EB)
*	Guard 2: FLEEING toward entrance (morale broken)
*	Guard 3: 40 feet away, has crossbow, HEXED, searching for you
*	Guard 4: 45 feet away, has crossbow, searching for you
Tactical situation:
*	Primary objective complete (Gharash dead)
*	2 of 4 guards down
*	1 guard fleeing (will raise alarm soon)
*	2 guards still engaged but can't see you clearly
*	Water exit is 40 feet from your position
*	Mira's distraction still creating chaos outside
 
ROUND 2 - KESSA'S TURN
What does Kessa do?
I'll default to her shooting the fleeing guard (prevent alarm) unless you want 
something else.
 
YOUR TURN COMING
What's your plan for Round 2?
Options:
*	Finish the remaining guards (prevent alarm)
*	Start retreat to water exit (mission complete)
*	Cast Shadow of Moil (if expecting reinforcements)
*	Something else
The clock is ticking. The fleeing guard will reach the perimeter in 6 
seconds (next turn).
What do you do?
Guard 3, hex and eb
Dec 7
ROUND 2 - KESSA'S TURN
STOPPING THE ALARM
Kessa sees Guard 2 fleeing toward the entrance-about to alert the entire 
garrison.
+1 Hand Crossbow (Sneak Attack - unseen attacker, advantage):
*	Attack Roll (advantage): 16 + 7 = 23 ? HIT
*	Damage: 4 + 4 = 8 piercing
*	Sneak Attack: 3d6 = 5 + 2 + 6 = 13
*	Total: 21 damage
The bolt takes him in the back between the shoulder blades. He drops mid-
stride, sliding face-first into the rubble.
Three down. Two guards remaining.
She calls down softly: "Make it quick-reinforcements will come eventually."
 
ROUND 2 - JOHANNES'S TURN
ELIMINATING GUARD 3
The Hex curse already coils around Guard 3. You focus through the shadows, 
unleashing death.
Eldritch Blast - Guard 3 (HEXED):
First Bolt:
*	Attack Roll: 15 + 7 = 22 ? HIT
*	Damage: 6 + 4 (Agonizing) = 10 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 6 necrotic damage
*	Total: 16 damage
Second Bolt:
*	Attack Roll: 9 + 7 = 16 ? HIT
*	Damage: 10 + 4 (Agonizing) = 14 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 1 necrotic damage
*	Total: 15 damage
TOTAL DAMAGE TO GUARD 3: 31
Guard 3 is obliterated-purple-white energy tears through his armor. He's 
dead before he realizes what hit him.
Four down. One guard remaining.
 
ROUND 2 - GUARD 4'S TURN
The last guard standing.
He's seen his commander fall. All four of his companions dead in seconds. 
Invisible attackers striking from nowhere.
Morale Check: 4 - 3 (everyone dead, alone) = 1 (CRITICAL FAILURE)
He drops his crossbow and RUNS.
Not toward the entrance-toward the perimeter, screaming:
"HELP! ASSASSINS! THE COMMANDER IS DEAD! HELP!"
He's 45 feet from the perimeter guards. He'll reach them in one more 
turn (6 seconds).
 
ROUND 2 COMPLETE - SITUATION
Friendlies:
*	Johannes: Still hidden, 2/2 spell slots, Hex available to transfer
*	Kessa: Elevated position, loaded crossbow
Enemies:
*	Gharash: DEAD (mission complete)
*	Guards 1-3: DEAD
*	Guard 2: DEAD (fleeing, shot by Kessa)
*	Guard 4: FLEEING, 45 feet from perimeter, screaming for help
Critical Decision:
You have ONE MORE TURN before Guard 4 reaches the perimeter and 
brings reinforcements.
 
ROUND 3 - KESSA'S TURN
Kessa calls down: "Last one's running! Your call-drop him or we go 
NOW?"
Options:
1.	Kessa shoots the fleeing guard (stop the alarm, buy more time)
2.	Both retreat immediately (accept the alarm, get to water fast)
What do you want Kessa to do?
And what's your plan for Round 3?
Guard 4. Hex, eb
Dec 7
ROUND 3 - KESSA'S TURN
SILENCING THE LAST WITNESS
Kessa tracks the fleeing guard, leading the target as he runs.
+1 Hand Crossbow (Long range, moving target):
*	Attack Roll: 13 + 7 = 20 ? HIT
*	Damage: 3 + 4 = 7 piercing
*	Sneak Attack: 3d6 = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9
*	Total: 16 damage
The bolt catches him mid-stride. He stumbles, falls, tries to crawl-still 
reaching toward the perimeter.
He's wounded but not down yet.
 
ROUND 3 - JOHANNES'S TURN
THE FINAL KILL
Hex Transfer (Bonus Action): The curse leaps to Guard 4.
Eldritch Blast - Guard 4 (HEXED, prone and crawling):
First Bolt:
*	Attack Roll: 18 + 7 = 25 ? HIT
*	Damage: 8 + 4 (Agonizing) = 12 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 4 necrotic damage
*	Total: 16 damage
He stops crawling.
Second Bolt (insurance):
*	Attack Roll: 12 + 7 = 19 ? HIT
*	Damage: 5 + 4 (Agonizing) = 9 force damage
*	Hex Damage: 3 necrotic damage
*	Total: 12 damage
The guard collapses face-first into the ash and rubble. Still.
 
PERFECT SILENCE
The warehouse ruins are silent except for:
*	Distant shouts from Mira's distraction (still drawing attention north)
*	Your breathing
*	Kessa's quiet movement as she descends from her perch
Bodies:
*	Commander Gharash (dead, neck wound)
*	Elite Guard 1 (dead, Eldritch Blast)
*	Elite Guard 2 (dead, crossbow bolt to back)
*	Elite Guard 3 (dead, Eldritch Blast)
*	Elite Guard 4 (dead, combination fire)
Five corpses. Zero survivors. Zero alarm raised.
 
KESSA REACHES YOUR POSITION
She's already moving, professional and efficient:
"Clean work. Now we move."
She's gathering spent crossbow bolts (can't leave evidence), checking the 
bodies quickly.
Perception Check (Kessa - listening for response): 19 + 4 = 23
"Perimeter guards are still focused north-Mira's distraction is holding. But 
we've got maybe five minutes before someone checks on Gharash or 
investigates the sounds of combat."
 
THE ESCAPE - WATER EXIT
You both move to the submerged entrance you prepared.
Gillyweed consumed: The familiar transformation-gills, webbed digits, 
water breathing.
Kessa also takes the gillyweed. "How long does this last?"
"Several hours. More than enough."
 
UNDERWATER - THE LONG WAIT
You slip into the cold harbor water and descend into darkness.
The plan: Stay submerged until nightfall (approximately 4-5 hours from 
now), then surface far from the docks and signal Captain Andra.
Stealth Check (Underwater, staying hidden):
*	Johannes: 16 + 2 = 18
*	Kessa (with Cloak of Elvenkind advantage): 17 + 6 = 23
You find a perfect hiding spot-beneath a collapsed dock section, deep water, 
complete concealment. The gillyweed works perfectly. Your Manta Ray Cloak 
helps you navigate and stay comfortable.
 
ABOVE WATER - THE DISCOVERY
About 30 minutes later, you hear (muffled through water):
Horns blowing. Shouting. Running footsteps.
They've found the bodies.
You hear (distantly):
*	"THE COMMANDER IS DEAD!"
*	"SEAL THE HARBOR!"
*	"SEARCH EVERY BUILDING!"
*	"FIND THEM!"
Through the murky water, you see:
*	Boats launching from docks
*	Guards running along the waterfront
*	Torches being lit despite it being afternoon
*	General chaos and panic
But no one looks underwater. No one expects that escape route.
 
THE WAIT CONTINUES
Hours pass. The gillyweed sustains you. The water is cold but bearable.
Above, the search intensifies:
*	Guard patrols quadruple
*	Buildings being searched
*	Checkpoints locked down
*	The wyvern launches, circling the city
But you're invisible beneath the waves.
 
NIGHTFALL
Darkness finally falls.
The search continues, but with less intensity. Torches dot the waterfront. 
Patrol boats drift lazily, guards tired from hours of fruitless searching.
Kessa signals: Time to move.
You swim north, staying deep, using the darkness. A mile from Saltmere's 
docks, you surface carefully.
Perception Check (scanning for pursuit): 15 + 1 = 16
No patrol boats nearby. The search is concentrated around Saltmere proper.
 
SIGNAL FOR EXTRACTION
You pull out the signal flares from your waterproof gear.
Three flares, fired into the night sky.
Red. Green. Red.
 
CAPTAIN ANDRA'S RESPONSE
Within fifteen minutes, you see sails approaching-fast sloop, running dark, 
expertly handled.
A rope ladder drops over the side.
Strong hands pull you aboard. Captain Andra-weather-beaten woman in her 
fifties-grins.
"Heard you killed Commander Gharash. Whole port's in chaos. Well done."
Kessa climbs aboard, dripping. "Can we get the hell out of here?"
"Already moving." The sloop is turning north, sails catching wind.
 
SAILING NORTH
Saltmere disappears behind you. The search lights grow distant.
You're safe. You're away. Mission complete.
Captain Andra brings hot soup and dry blankets. "We'll have you well north by 
dawn. Where to after that?"
 
THE SENDING STONE
You remember: Garrett cached the second sending stone for you to retrieve.
Do you:
1.	Have Captain Andra drop you near the cache location (retrieve 
stone, then continue to Solace)
2.	Go straight to Solace (retrieve stone on a separate trip)
3.	Something else
What's your plan?
Before that, Stop bodies of valuables, put in bag of holding.
Dec 7
LOOTING THE FALLEN
WAIT - REWIND
You're absolutely right. Let me back up to right after the combat, before you 
went underwater.
 
IMMEDIATELY AFTER COMBAT - LOOTING
Kessa is already thinking practically: "We've got maybe five minutes. 
Strip them fast."
You both move quickly through the bodies:
 
COMMANDER GHARASH
Equipment:
*	+1 Plate Armor (requires attunement) - high quality, Dragon Army 
commander insignia
*	+1 Greatsword (requires attunement) - masterwork blade
*	Ring of Protection (requires attunement) - +1 AC and saves
*	Amulet of Health (requires attunement) - Sets CON to 19
*	Commander's Seal and Papers - official documents, orders, 
intelligence
*	Belt Pouch: 80 gold pieces, 3 platinum pieces
*	Map Case: Regional maps with Dragon Army positions marked
*	Signal Horn (military, ornate)
Into the Bag of Holding it goes.
 
ELITE GUARDS (4 total)
Each guard has:
*	Half-plate armor (non-magical, but quality)
*	Longsword (masterwork, non-magical)
*	Heavy crossbow
*	20 crossbow bolts
*	Belt pouch: 10-15 gold each (total ~50 gold)
*	Dragon Army insignia and identification papers
You take:
*	All the gold (130 gold total from guards + Gharash)
*	Gharash's magical items (the valuable stuff)
*	Maps and intelligence documents
*	One set of guard armor/weapons (might be useful for disguise 
later)
You leave:
*	The rest of the mundane equipment (too bulky, not valuable enough)
*	Bodies themselves (can't fit five corpses in the bag anyway)
 
TOTAL HAUL FROM ASSASSINATION
Magical Items:
*	+1 Plate Armor (Gharash)
*	+1 Greatsword (Gharash)
*	Ring of Protection (Gharash)
*	Amulet of Health (Gharash)
Currency:
*	80 gold + 3 platinum (30 gold value) = 110 gold
*	50 gold from guards
*	Total: 160 gold
Intelligence:
*	Commander's seal and papers
*	Regional maps with Dragon Army positions
*	Official orders and communications
Misc:
*	Signal horn
*	One set of guard equipment
Time elapsed: 3 minutes
 
NOW THE ESCAPE
Kessa finishes stuffing items into your Bags of Holding:
"Got everything valuable. Bodies are staying-can't do anything about that."
She listens carefully. "Perimeter guards still distracted. We need to move 
NOW."
 
UNDERWATER ESCAPE (AS PREVIOUSLY 
DESCRIBED)
You consume gillyweed, slip into the water, hide beneath the collapsed dock 
for 4-5 hours while chaos erupts above.
Nightfall. Surface a mile north. Signal Captain Andra.
 
ABOARD THE SHIP - INVENTORY
Now safely aboard and sailing north, you and Kessa inventory the haul 
properly.
Kessa examines the Amulet of Health: "This sets your Constitution to 
19. That's... that's a massive survivability boost for anyone."
The +1 Plate Armor: "Heavy, requires attunement, but incredible 
protection. Fighter's dream."
The Ring of Protection: "+1 to AC and all saves. Universally useful."
The +1 Greatsword: "Not our style, but valuable trade goods or gift for 
Haven's fighters."
She grins. "We killed a Dragon Army Commander and got paid for it. That's 
professional."
 
THE SENDING STONE RETRIEVAL
Captain Andra asks: "So where am I actually taking you? You mentioned a 
cache to retrieve?"
The cached sending stone is somewhere between Saltmere and 
Haven-Garrett would have hidden it on the route north.
Options:
1.	Stop at the cache location (retrieve stone tonight/tomorrow)
2.	Go straight to Solace (come back for stone later)
3.	Have Captain Andra drop you somewhere specific
What's your plan?
Also: Do you want to use the sending stone to contact Laurana NOW (using 
Gharash's stone + Laurana's stone) or wait until you retrieve Garrett's cached 
stone?
Garash had a stone as well?
Dec 7
CLARIFICATION - NO SENDING 
STONE ON GHARASH
MY MISTAKE
No, Gharash did not have a sending stone. I misspoke.
The sending stone situation:
*	Stone 1: Laurana has it (at Haven)
*	Stone 2: Garrett carried it during the mission, then cached it before the 
strike for you to retrieve
You currently have NO sending stone - you need to retrieve the one 
Garrett cached.
 
THE CACHE RETRIEVAL
Captain Andra waits for direction: "Where to?"
The cached stone is somewhere on the route between Saltmere and 
Haven - Garrett would have hidden it at a pre-arranged landmark (though we 
didn't specify exactly where during planning).
Logical cache location options:
*	Crossroads shrine (mentioned earlier as Rally Point 1)
*	Abandoned mill (mentioned as Rally Point 2)
*	Some other landmark Garrett would know
Do you want to:
1.	Head to the cache location first (retrieve stone, then proceed to 
Solace)
2.	Go straight to Solace (winter there, retrieve stone on a later trip)
3.	Specify where the cache actually is (and we'll go get it)
Once you have the stone, you can:
*	Update Laurana on mission success
*	Coordinate over the winter
*	Maintain contact with Haven without physical visits
What's your preference?
Retrieve Stone, send message, then head for Solace.
Dec 7
RETRIEVING THE STONE
CAPTAIN ANDRA'S COURSE
"We'll put you ashore near the crossroads shrine," Captain Andra says, 
adjusting heading. "That's the most likely spot for a cache-visible landmark, 
off the main road, easy to find."
The sloop glides north through the night.
 
LANDFALL - THE CROSSROADS SHRINE
Dawn breaks as you reach shore. Captain Andra's crew rows you to a 
secluded beach.
"Good hunting," the captain says. "And if you need extraction again, send 
word through Haven. I owe Commander Brightblade."
The sloop disappears north, leaving you and Kessa on the beach.
 
FINDING THE CACHE
The crossroads shrine is a half-day's walk inland. Small stone structure 
dedicated to Mishakal, a traditional waypoint for travelers.
Investigation Check (searching for Garrett's cache):
*	Johannes: 14 + 1 = 15
*	Kessa: 19 + 5 = 24
Kessa finds it within minutes.
Behind a loose stone in the shrine's foundation-carefully hidden but exactly 
where someone looking would find it.
Inside a waterproof leather pouch:
*	The Sending Stone (paired with Laurana's)
*	A note from Garrett:
"Commander Constantinius,
Mission complete. All team members returned safely to Haven. Commander 
Brightblade awaits your report. The people here speak of you with hope.
Thank you for giving us the chance to matter.
- Garrett"
 
THE MESSAGE TO LAURANA
You hold the sending stone, activating it with a thought.
Sending (25 words maximum):
What message do you send to Commander Brightblade?
Some version of:
*	Mission success
*	Gharash dead
*	All guards eliminated
*	Clean extraction
*	Heading to Solace for winter
*	Will coordinate via stones
What exactly do you say?
Yes
Dec 7
THE MESSAGE
SENDING TO LAURANA
You activate the stone, feeling the arcane connection spark to life:
Your message (25 words):
"Brightblade. Gharash dead. All guards eliminated. Clean extraction by sea. 
No survivors, no witnesses. Heading to Solace for winter. Will coordinate via 
stones. Mission complete. Constantinius."
 
LAURANA'S RESPONSE
A moment's pause, then her voice comes through-relief and triumph evident:
"Received. Exceptional work. Dragon Army in chaos. Verminaard sending 
investigators. You made the right call on Solace. Safe travels. We'll 
coordinate spring operations. Brightblade out."
 
THE ROAD TO SOLACE
Kessa pockets the stone. "Done. Clean break. Now we disappear for winter 
while Haven benefits from the chaos and Verminaard wastes resources 
hunting ghosts."
She looks at the road stretching west. "Solace. I've heard it's beautiful this time 
of year. Trees turning colors, vallenwood groves..."
A slight smile. "And we'll be there as wealthy, successful operatives rather 
than desperate refugees. That's a nice change."
 
THE JOURNEY WEST
You have:
*	Two Bags of Holding full of wealth and magical items
*	Communication with Haven via sending stones
*	A legendary kill to your names (Commander Gharash)
*	Winter ahead to rest, plan, and prepare
*	No one hunting you (trails lead nowhere)
The path to Solace is clear.

TO SOLACE
Ready to transition to winter in Solace?
Or is there anything you want to address before we close this chapter and 
move to the next phase?
Incredible work, Clayn. That was a masterclass in tactical 
assassination-planning, execution, and extraction all flawless.
Nope. I've got time, let's move on
Dec 7
WINTER IN SOLACE
ARRIVAL
Two weeks of travel bring you to Solace as autumn deepens into early winter.
The town rises before you-famous for its vallenwood trees, massive 
ancient giants with homes built into their branches, connected by rope bridges 
and wooden walkways high above the ground.
The Inn of the Last Home dominates the town center-largest structure, 
built around and through a massive vallenwood, accessible by winding stairs 
wrapped around the trunk.
Kessa whistles softly. "Now this is civilization. After months of 
warehouses, docks, and ruins, I could use a proper bed and decent ale."
 
ESTABLISHING WINTER QUARTERS
The Inn of the Last Home offers long-term lodging. The innkeeper-a 
robust woman named Otik Sandath-quotes rates:
"Two gold per week for a private room, meals included. Six gold per month if 
you're staying for winter. And yes, the ale is as good as they say."
You have plenty of gold. This is affordable luxury.
Kessa grins. "I vote yes. We've earned some comfort."
 
SOLACE - WINTER SETUP
Over the next few weeks, you establish yourselves:
Lodging: Private room at the Inn, comfortable, warm, secure Cover 
story: Merchants wintering over, waiting for spring trade routes Social 
presence: Low-key, professional, not drawing attention Sending 
stone: Hidden safely, regular communication with Laurana
 
LAURANA'S UPDATES (via Sending Stone)
Throughout winter, Laurana sends periodic updates:
Week 2: "Verminaard sent investigators to Saltmere. Found nothing useful. 
Search expanding randomly. Haven remains unnoticed. Refugee numbers 
growing. Using your gold for fortifications."
Week 6: "Dragon Army appointed new regional commander-cautious, 
paranoid. Operations slowed but not stopped. Spring targets emerging. Will 
coordinate when weather clears. Haven thrives."
Week 10: "Pax Tharkas still holds hundreds of prisoners. Mining operations 
forced labor. Considering liberation operation for spring. Your capabilities 
would be invaluable. Discuss when ready."
 
WINTER ACTIVITIES
You have 3-4 months of downtime. What do you focus on?
Potential activities:
1. Training/Study:
*	Research your patron/curse
*	Study the Disks of Mishakal
*	Practice combat techniques
*	Learn new skills
2. Intelligence Gathering:
*	Decode Voss's ledgers
*	Study Dragon Army maps
*	Research Pax Tharkas
*	Identify spring targets
3. Social/Networking:
*	Make contacts in Solace
*	Gather rumors and information
*	Recruit potential allies
*	Build cover identity
4. Equipment/Preparation:
*	Attune to new magical items (Gharash's gear)
*	Craft or acquire supplies
*	Prepare for spring operations
*	Organize inventory
5. Rest and Recovery:
*	Actually relax for once
*	Strengthen partnership with Kessa
*	Process recent events
*	Mental/emotional recovery
6. Planning:
*	Coordinate with Laurana on spring operations
*	Research potential targets
*	Develop strategic approaches
*	Prepare for Pax Tharkas or other missions
 
KESSA'S INTERESTS
"I'm thinking I want to actually enjoy this winter," she says one evening over 
ale. "We've been running non-stop for months. Saltmere, Gharash, constant 
danger..."
"Don't get me wrong-I'm ready to get back to work in spring. But for now? I 
want to drink good ale, sleep in a real bed, maybe learn something useful that 
doesn't involve someone trying to kill me."
She looks at you. "What about you? What does Johannes Constantinius do 
when he's not assassinating Dragon Army commanders?"
 
THE DISKS QUESTION
The Disks of Mishakal remain in your Bag of Holding. Throughout winter, 
their presence weighs on you.
Khisanth's instruction: Find someone worthy.
Laurana Brightblade: Leading real resistance, organizing refugees, 
building something meaningful. She might be worthy.
But: You haven't decided yet. The Ring of Mind Shielding protects you now. 
The Disks aren't urgent-you have time.
Do you want to address this during winter, or let it wait?
 
YOUR PATRON
It's been roughly 2 months since your last tribute payment (the artifacts 
from Dragons of Despair/Firestorm Peak).
You have approximately 10 months until the next payment is due.
The demon is quiet-you feel the pact's presence, but no immediate pressure. 
The Ring of Mind Shielding keeps your thoughts private.
Do you want to research breaking the pact during winter?
 
WINTER PLAN - YOUR CHOICE
What do you want to focus on this winter?
Pick 2-3 main activities and I'll narrate the winter progression, or tell me 
specifically what you want to do and we'll play it out in detail.
What's your priority?
Pax Tharkas, combat skills, resistance organization
Dec 7
WINTER FOCUS - PREPARATION 
FOR SPRING
THE THREE PILLARS
You establish a disciplined winter routine focused on three areas:
 
1. PAX THARKAS RESEARCH
GATHERING INTELLIGENCE
The Inn of the Last Home is a crossroads for travelers, merchants, and 
refugees. Perfect for information gathering.
Over winter, you collect intelligence on Pax Tharkas through:
Refugees who escaped:
*	Survivors with firsthand knowledge
*	Former prisoners with layout information
*	Guards who defected or were dismissed
Merchants who've dealt with Dragon Army:
*	Supply contractors
*	Traders who've seen the fortress
*	Black market contacts
Military deserters:
*	Former Dragon Army soldiers drinking away guilt
*	Officers who couldn't stomach the cruelty
*	Scouts who've observed from distance
 
WHAT YOU LEARN - PAX THARKAS
Investigation Check (gathering information over 3 months):
*	Johannes: 16 + 1 = 17
*	Kessa: 21 + 5 = 26 (she's better at social intelligence gathering)
Kessa compiles a comprehensive brief:
 
FORTRESS BASICS
Location: Mountain pass between Qualinesti and Abanasinia, controlling 
critical trade route
Purpose:
*	Military fortress (garrison of 800+ soldiers)
*	Slave labor camp (600-800 prisoners)
*	Mining operation (iron ore, strategic materials)
*	Supply depot for Dragon Army operations
Commander:
*	Dragon Highlord Verminaard himself uses it as regional 
headquarters
*	Backed by a red dragon named Ember (ancient, terrifying)
*	Multiple sub-commanders managing day-to-day operations
 
DEFENSES
Physical:
*	Massive stone fortress built into mountain
*	60-foot walls, fortified gates
*	Guard towers every 100 feet
*	Chokepoint geography (mountain pass)
*	Single main entrance (heavily defended)
*	Secondary mining tunnels (collapsed or guarded)
Personnel:
*	800+ Dragon Army soldiers (mix of quality)
*	Elite units guard critical areas
*	Slave drivers and overseers (brutal)
*	Clerics of Takhisis (dark magic support)
*	The red dragon Ember (patrols periodically)
Magical:
*	Wards on main gates (alarm spells)
*	Scrying capabilities (limited but present)
*	Dragon fear aura (Ember's presence)
*	Dark clerical magic
 
THE PRISONERS
Demographics:
*	600-800 total (fluctuates as some die, new ones arrive)
*	Men, women, elderly, some children
*	Mix of races (humans, elves, dwarves, kender)
*	From conquered territories across the region
Conditions:
*	Forced labor in mines (12-14 hour days)
*	Minimal food, poor shelter
*	High mortality rate (disease, accidents, exhaustion)
*	Brutal punishments for resistance
Organization:
*	Divided into work gangs (50-100 each)
*	Housed in barracks (overcrowded)
*	Some leadership among prisoners (informal)
*	Resistance potential exists but suppressed by fear
 
VULNERABILITIES IDENTIFIED
Kessa's analysis points out potential weaknesses:
1. Supply Lines:
*	Fortress depends on external supply caravans
*	Food for 1,400+ people (soldiers + prisoners)
*	Mining equipment and materials
*	Disrupting supplies could create chaos
2. Internal Tensions:
*	Guards are cruel but not universally loyal
*	Some are conscripts who hate the work
*	Potential for defection or corruption
*	Class divisions (elite vs. regular troops)
3. Prisoner Expertise:
*	Among 800 prisoners, there are fighters, craftspeople, mages
*	If armed and organized, significant combat potential
*	Current disorganization is main weakness
*	Liberation requires coordination, not just opening doors
4. Geographic Limitations:
*	Mountain pass means limited escape routes
*	Dragon Army can't easily pursue in all directions
*	Refugees need guidance to survive mountain terrain
*	Weather affects operations (winter is harsh)
5. Verminaard's Absence:
*	He's not always at Pax Tharkas (travels for campaigns)
*	When he's gone, command structure is weaker
*	Ember (the dragon) also leaves periodically
*	Timing a strike during their absence is critical
 
THE CHALLENGE
One evening, Kessa spreads maps across your table:
"Here's the reality: Pax Tharkas isn't Saltmere. It's not even close."
She taps the fortress drawing. "Saltmere was a corrupt port with lazy guards 
and one paranoid commander. We killed six people and freed fifty prisoners."
"Pax Tharkas has 800 soldiers, a Dragon Highlord, and a red dragon. 
We'd need to free 600+ prisoners and get them through mountain 
passes while being pursued by dragons and armies."
She looks at you seriously. "This isn't an assassination. This is a military 
operation. It requires an army, coordination, planning, logistics, and a lot of 
luck."
She pauses. "Which means we can't do it alone. We need Haven's full 
support, probably allies from other resistance cells, and a plan that accounts 
for everything going wrong at least twice."
 
YOUR ASSESSMENT
After months of research, you understand:
Pax Tharkas is possible-but not yet.
What's needed:
*	Larger force (100+ fighters minimum)
*	Inside intelligence (someone in the fortress)
*	Coordination with prisoner leadership
*	Supply disruption to weaken defenders
*	Timing (when Verminaard and Ember are absent)
*	Escape routes prepared and secured
*	Haven's full logistical support
This is a spring/summer operation at earliest-possibly beyond 
that.
 
2. COMBAT SKILLS TRAINING
HONING YOUR CAPABILITIES
Winter provides time to train systematically.
 
JOHANNES - WARLOCK REFINEMENT

*	Emergency extraction protocols
*	Non-verbal communication signals
*	Covering each other's weaknesses
Performance Check (training effectiveness over 3 months):
*	Johannes: 15 + 2 = 17 (solid improvement)
*	Kessa: 18 + 5 = 23 (exceptional growth)
 
TRAINING RESULTS
Mechanical benefits (if you want them):
Johannes:
*	+1 to hit with Eldritch Blast in darkness (Devil's Sight mastery)
*	Advantage on Stealth checks when using One with Shadows (refined 
technique)
*	Can coordinate with up to 5 allies without penalty (group tactics)
Kessa:
*	+1 to ranged attacks with hand crossbow (marksmanship training)
*	Can hide as bonus action even without cover in dim light (Cloak + 
training synergy)
*	+2 to Insight checks (social skills improvement)
(These are narrative bonuses, not permanent mechanical changes, 
but reflect winter improvement)
 
3. RESISTANCE ORGANIZATION
COORDINATING WITH HAVEN
Throughout winter, you use the sending stones to coordinate with Laurana.
 
STRATEGIC PLANNING SESSIONS
Regular communication (once per week via Sending):
You and Laurana develop a strategic framework for spring operations:
 
ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE
Laurana proposes (and you refine):
Haven Resistance splits into three operational branches:
1. Defense Force (Captain Morna leads):
*	Protect Haven itself
*	Train refugees in basic combat
*	Fortify positions
*	React to Dragon Army threats
*	Size: 200 fighters (defensive posture)
2. Strike Teams (You + Kessa coordinate):
*	Small unit operations (4-8 people)
*	Assassinations, sabotage, intelligence
*	High-value targets
*	Quick in-and-out missions
*	Size: 3-5 teams of 6-8 each (30-40 total elite operatives)
3. Support Network (Thoric Ironforge manages):
*	Supply lines and logistics
*	Intelligence gathering
*	Refugee evacuation
*	Safe houses and resources
*	Communication coordination
*	Size: 100+ non-combatants in various roles
 
SPRING TARGET IDENTIFICATION
Through winter, you and Laurana identify potential operations:
Tier 1 - High Value, High Difficulty:
*	Pax Tharkas liberation (requires massive preparation)
*	Assassinate Dragon Highlord (suicidal without perfect conditions)
*	Destroy major supply depot (heavily guarded)
Tier 2 - Medium Value, Medium Difficulty:
*	Free smaller prison camps (50-100 prisoners)
*	Disrupt supply convoys (hit-and-run)
*	Eliminate regional commanders (like Gharash)
*	Sabotage Dragon Army infrastructure
Tier 3 - Lower Value, Lower Risk:
*	Intelligence gathering operations
*	Recruitment drives in occupied territories
*	Establish new safe houses
*	Smuggling operations (weapons, supplies, people)
Laurana's recommendation: "Build from Tier 3 to Tier 1. Establish 
success patterns, train teams, build confidence and capability. Pax Tharkas 
is the endgame-we work toward it, not jump into it."
 
RESOURCE ALLOCATION
Your gold from Saltmere/Gharash operations (plus earlier wealth):
You've contributed approximately 1,900 gold total to Haven over time.
Laurana's report on how it's been used:
*	500 gold: Weapons and armor (equipping fighters)
*	300 gold: Fortifications (walls, gates, defenses)
*	400 gold: Food and medical supplies (winter provisions)
*	200 gold: Intelligence network (bribes, informants, communication)
*	300 gold: Training and equipment for strike teams
*	200 gold: Reserve fund (emergencies, opportunities)
Haven is now:
*	Well-defended (can resist small-to-medium Dragon Army assaults)
*	Well-fed (winter survival secured)
*	Well-equipped (fighters have real weapons, not improvised)
*	Well-informed (intelligence network functioning)
*	Well-organized (command structure, training programs)
Your contribution has transformed Haven from desperate refugee 
camp to functional resistance base.
 
MAGICAL ITEM DISTRIBUTION
You discuss Gharash's gear with Laurana via Sending:
Over multiple conversations, you coordinate:
+1 Plate Armor:
*	Offer to Haven's best frontline fighter
*	Laurana assigns it to a human paladin named Sturm (no relation to her 
late husband, but reminds her of him)
+1 Greatsword:
*	Paired with the armor for Sturm
*	Makes him significantly more effective
Ring of Protection:
*	Offered to Captain Morna (she leads defense, needs survivability)
*	She accepts gratefully
Amulet of Health (CON 19):
*	You keep this one (massive survivability boost for you)
*	Kessa agrees: "You're our primary damage dealer and most exposed in 
combat. You need it."
Johannes now attuned to:
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding (mental protection)
2.	Rope of Entanglement (utility/control)
3.	Amulet of Health (NEW - CON becomes 19)
New HP Total: Recalculate with CON 19 (+4 modifier):
*	Level 7 Warlock: 7d8 + (7  4) = Average 31.5 + 28 = ~60 HP (if rolling 
average)
*	Or if you prefer: Roll 7d8 + 28
You're significantly more durable now.
 
RECRUITMENT AND EXPANSION
Laurana reports:
"Word is spreading. The story of Saltmere-fifty prisoners freed, operation 
destroyed. The assassination of Commander Gharash-killed in his own 
secured zone with zero survivors to report what happened."
"People are hearing that resistance is possible. That Dragon Army 
commanders can die. That there's a place-Haven-where people fight back."
Refugee influx:
*	Haven's population: 800 ? 1,100 over winter
*	New fighters volunteering: +150 capable recruits
*	Craftspeople, healers, mages arriving: +50 specialists
The resistance is growing.
 
WINTER'S END - SPRING APPROACHES
As the last snows melt and the first green appears, you receive a 
Sending from Laurana:
"Spring arrives. Multiple targets identified. Strike teams ready. Your 
leadership requested. Return to Haven for operational planning when able. 
Critical opportunity emerging. Brightblade."
Kessa looks at you over breakfast at the Inn.
"Winter was nice. Comfortable beds, good food, actual rest." She grins. "But 
I'm ready to get back to work. You?"
 
SPRING OPERATIONS AWAIT
You've spent winter:
*	Researching Pax Tharkas (thorough intelligence gathered)
*	Training combat skills (both improved significantly)
*	Organizing resistance (Haven is now a real force)
*	Resting and recovering (ready for action)
You have:
*	Communication with Haven (sending stones)
*	Improved capabilities (training, new attunement)
*	Strategic clarity (targets identified, plans developing)
*	A growing resistance (1,100 people, organized, equipped)
The question:
What does spring bring?
Do you:
1.	Return to Haven immediately (answer Laurana's call)
2.	Investigate the "critical opportunity" she mentioned
3.	Propose a specific operation
4.	Something else
What's your move, Commander Constantinius?
2
Dec 7
THE CRITICAL OPPORTUNITY
RESPONDING TO LAURANA
You activate the sending stone:
"Brightblade. Winter complete. Trained and ready. What's the critical 
opportunity? Details needed before we commit to Haven return. Will 
coordinate based on intel. Constantinius."
 
LAURANA'S DETAILED RESPONSE
Her reply comes quickly-she's been waiting:
"Dragon Army supply convoy. Weekly route through Westgate Pass. Fifty 
prisoners being transferred to Pax Tharkas. Light guard-only twelve 
soldiers. Intelligence says Verminaard and Ember both absent from region. 
Window closes in ten days."
A second message follows immediately:
"This is perfect strike team mission. Free prisoners, capture supplies, 
minimal risk compared to Pax Tharkas direct assault. Proof of concept for 
larger operations. Your capabilities ideal for this. Interested?"
 
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT
She's already pulling out maps, spreading them on the table.
"Westgate Pass... I know it. Mountain route, narrow in sections, limited 
visibility, perfect ambush terrain." She traces the route with her finger.
"Twelve guards is manageable-we killed six in Saltmere including Gharash 
himself. With proper planning and a small team, this is absolutely doable."
She looks up. "Fifty prisoners freed, Dragon Army supplies captured, and 
we're hitting their logistics instead of their fortresses. This is exactly the kind 
of operation Laurana was talking about-Tier 2, medium value, medium 
difficulty, high success probability."
 
REQUESTING MORE INTELLIGENCE
You send another message:
"Interested. Need specifics: convoy composition, guard quality, prisoner 
condition, exact timing, terrain details, extraction plan, Haven support 
available. Send comprehensive intel. Constantinius."
 
LAURANA'S INTELLIGENCE BRIEF
Over the next hour, through multiple Sending stone messages and a courier 
arriving with written materials, you receive:
 
CONVOY DETAILS
Route:
*	Departs Dragon Army depot at Westgate (small garrison town)
*	Travels through Westgate Pass (mountain route, 3-day journey)
*	Arrives at Pax Tharkas
*	Next convoy departs in 10 days
Composition:
*	2 large wagons (supplies: food, mining equipment, weapons)
*	1 prison wagon (reinforced, locked, holds 50 prisoners)
*	12 Dragon Army guards (8 regulars, 4 veterans)
*	1 sergeant (leader, experienced but not elite)
*	4 wagon drivers (non-combatants, impressed civilians)
Schedule:
*	Day 1: Depart Westgate at dawn, travel 15 miles, camp at Stagwood 
Grove
*	Day 2: Travel 12 miles through Westgate Pass (narrowest section), camp 
at Cliffside
*	Day 3: Final 8 miles to Pax Tharkas, arrive by evening
Prisoners:
*	50 total (mix of ages and genders)
*	Physically weakened (inadequate food, harsh treatment)
*	Chained but not individually shackled (mass restraint system)
*	Guarded but guards are overconfident (routine run, no incidents in 
months)
 
TERRAIN - WESTGATE PASS
Key Features:
Stagwood Grove (Day 1 camp):
*	Forest clearing, decent visibility
*	Guards set perimeter watch
*	Prisoners locked in wagon overnight
*	Ambush difficulty: Medium (open area, guards alert)
Westgate Pass - Narrow Section (Day 2):
*	Mountain road, 10 feet wide
*	Steep cliffs on both sides (60+ feet)
*	Limited visibility (rocky outcroppings)
*	Single-file wagon passage through tightest section
*	Ambush difficulty: Low (perfect terrain, limited escape)
Cliffside Camp (Day 2 night):
*	Small plateau, cliff on one side
*	Natural defensibility (guards chose it for that reason)
*	Limited approach routes
*	Ambush difficulty: High (defensible position)
 
GUARD ASSESSMENT
Intelligence from Haven's scouts:
Sergeant Krell:
*	Mid-level officer, competent but not brilliant
*	Runs routine patrols (predictable)
*	Overconfident from months of safe runs
*	Weakness: Believes the route is secure
8 Regular Guards:
*	Adequate training, decent equipment
*	Bored from repetitive duty
*	Follow orders but not highly motivated
*	Weakness: Complacency
4 Veterans:
*	Combat experience, better equipped
*	More alert and professional
*	Positioned at key points (front, rear, prisoner wagon)
*	Weakness: Still expecting routine run, not combat
Drivers:
*	Pressed into service, not soldiers
*	Will flee or surrender if combat starts
*	Not a threat, possibly sympathetic to prisoners
 
HAVEN'S SUPPORT AVAILABLE
Laurana offers:
Strike Team Assets:
*	Garrett and his crew (6 people: Garrett, Finn, Cole, Rickard, Tomms, 
Olev) - Available, eager to participate
*	Captain Morna + 4 rangers - Combat-capable scouts, can provide 
support
*	Thoric Ironforge + 2 dwarven fighters - Heavy combat if needed
*	Your choice of team composition (recommend 8-12 total for this 
mission)
Logistical Support:
*	Escape route planned (northwest toward Haven)
*	Safe houses along route (food, shelter, medical)
*	Wagons waiting to transport freed prisoners
*	Medical team ready to treat wounded/sick prisoners
Equipment:
*	Healing potions (10 available)
*	Alchemical items (smoke bombs, etc.)
*	Lock-breaking tools (for prison wagon)
*	Weapons to arm freed prisoners if needed
Communication:
*	Haven forces positioned along escape route
*	Ready to support if things go wrong
*	Signal system (flares) to coordinate timing
 
THE PLAN - LAURANA'S PROPOSAL
Her recommendation:
"Hit them in Westgate Pass on Day 2. The narrow section gives 
maximum advantage-limited escape, perfect ambush terrain, guards can't 
form proper defensive positions.
Team composition: You, Kessa, Garrett's crew (6), plus 2-3 Haven rangers 
for support. Total 10-12 fighters vs. 12 guards (minus 4 non-combatant 
drivers).
Approach:
*	Position team in the rocks above the pass
*	Wait for convoy to enter kill zone
*	Strike from elevation (you + Kessa ranged attacks)
*	Garrett's team engages from flanks
*	Overwhelming surprise, superior position
Objectives:
1.	Neutralize guards (kill or capture)
2.	Secure wagons and prisoners
3.	Treat wounded prisoners
4.	Escort everyone northwest to Haven
5.	Capture supplies for resistance
Timeline:
*	3 days to reach ambush point
*	Set up positions (1 day)
*	Execute ambush (Day 2 of convoy's journey)
*	4-5 days escort to Haven
*	Total operation: ~9 days
Success probability: 75-80% with proper execution
Risk level: Medium (manageable enemies, good terrain, support available)
Reward: 50 freed prisoners, significant supplies, proof of concept for larger 
operations"
 
KESSA'S OPINION
"This is perfect," she says, studying the maps. "Everything we learned from 
Saltmere and Gharash applies here: superior positioning, surprise, 
overwhelming force at decisive moment, clean extraction."
"And we're not alone-Garrett's team knows their stuff, Haven's providing 
support, the terrain is ideal."
She grins. "Plus, fifty more people freed? That's meaningful. And we get to 
steal Dragon Army supplies while doing it. This is exactly the kind of operation 
that builds resistance momentum."
She looks at you. "I say we do it. Assemble the team, execute the plan, free the 
prisoners, hurt Verminaard's logistics."
 
THE DECISION
You have 10 days before the convoy departs Westgate.
Timeline if you commit:
*	Day 1-3: Travel to Westgate Pass
*	Day 4: Set up ambush positions
*	Day 5: Convoy enters kill zone, execute strike
*	Day 6-10: Escort prisoners to Haven
Do you:
1.	Accept the mission (coordinate with Laurana, assemble team, 
execute)
2.	Request modifications (different approach, team composition, 
tactics)
3.	Decline (too risky, not the right opportunity)
4.	Propose alternative (different target or timing)
What's your call?

Dec 7
OPERATION WESTGATE - 
MOBILIZATION
ACCEPTING THE MISSION
You activate the sending stone:
"Mission accepted. Optimal plan. Assembling strike team. Rendezvousing 
Haven in three days for final briefing and deployment. Request Garrett's 
crew, two rangers ready. Constantinius out."
Laurana's response:
"Confirmed. Strike team assembling. Garrett notified and eager. Rangers 
Tanis and Goldmoon assigned. Full briefing upon arrival. Supplies prepared. 
Equipment ready. Well done. Brightblade out."
 
KESSA'S PREPARATION
She's already moving, checking gear with practiced efficiency.
"Three days to Haven, one day briefing and final prep, three days to ambush 
point, one day setup. That puts us in position with one day margin before 
convoy arrives. Tight but workable."
She secures the Bags of Holding. "We're traveling light and fast. Leave the 
winter gear, take combat essentials."
Quick inventory check:
Johannes:
*	Spell slots ready (2/2 at 4th level)
*	Invocations optimized (Agonizing Blast, Repelling Blast, Devil's Sight, 
One with Shadows, Maddening Hex)
*	Attuned items: Ring of Mind Shielding, Rope of Entanglement, Amulet 
of Health (60 HP now)
*	Potions, scrolls, alchemical supplies
Kessa:
*	+1 Rapier, +1 Hand Crossbow, +1 Dagger
*	Cloak of Elvenkind
*	Full quiver, backup weapons
*	Thieves' tools, rope, supplies
"Let's move," she says.
 
JOURNEY TO HAVEN - 3 DAYS
The road from Solace to Haven is familiar now. You make good time.
Day 1: Clear roads, spring weather pleasant 
Day 2: Pass refugee groups heading toward Haven (word is still spreading) 
Day 3: Arrive at Haven by midday
 
HAVEN - SPRING TRANSFORMATION
The city has changed.
What was a desperate refugee camp last autumn is now an organized 
military base:
Physical Changes:
*	Fortified walls (reinforced, extended)
*	Proper guard towers (manned 24/7)
*	Training grounds (recruits drilling)
*	Armory (smiths working)
*	Organized housing (tent cities replaced by structured barracks)
Population Growth:
*	1,100+ people now
*	Fighters: 350+ capable combatants
*	Support personnel: crafters, healers, scouts, logistics
*	Refugees: families, elderly, children (protected, not abandoned)
Morale:
*	High spirits (victories at Saltmere and Gharash assassination are 
legendary)
*	Purpose (people believe resistance can win)
*	Organization (everyone has roles, responsibilities)
*	Hope (spring brings possibility)
Kessa whistles. "This is real. This isn't survivors hiding-this is an army 
preparing to fight."
 
COMMAND CENTER - THE BRIEFING
Laurana greets you personally.
She looks stronger than when you left-more confident, more commander 
than refugee princess. The winter has been good for her leadership.
"Johannes. Kessa. Welcome back." She clasps your hands warmly. "Your work 
in Saltmere and with Gharash has given us credibility. Recruits arrive because 
they've heard resistance wins."
She gestures to the war room. "Come. The team is assembled."
 
THE STRIKE TEAM - ASSEMBLED
Around the table:
Garrett and Crew:
*	Garrett (leader, local knowledge, tactical mind)
*	Rickard (veteran, combat experience, steady)
*	Finn and Cole (brothers, scouts, loyal)
*	Tomms and Olev (former guards, competent fighters)
They look different-trained, equipped, confident. Winter in Haven 
has made them into real soldiers.
Garrett grins when he sees you. "Commander Constantinius. Ready for 
another impossible mission?"
Haven Rangers:
*	Tanis Half-Elven (ranger, scout, archer - quiet, professional, late 20s)
*	Goldmoon (cleric of Mishakal, healer, fighter - calm, capable, early 
30s)
Captain Morna nods to you. "Tanis is our best scout-knows mountain 
terrain. Goldmoon provides healing and divine support. Both are combat-
tested."
Total Strike Team: 10 fighters
*	Johannes (warlock, tactical leader, heavy firepower)
*	Kessa (rogue/bard, stealth specialist, precise strikes)
*	Garrett, Rickard, Finn, Cole, Tomms, Olev (6 capable fighters, local 
knowledge)
*	Tanis (ranger, scout, archery)
*	Goldmoon (cleric, healer, support)
 
THE BRIEFING - DETAILED PLAN
Laurana spreads maps across the table.
"Here's what we know, confirmed by scouts who returned yesterday:"
 
UPDATED INTELLIGENCE
Convoy confirmed:
*	Departs Westgate in 7 days (Day 1 of convoy journey)
*	Composition as expected: 2 supply wagons, 1 prison wagon, 12 guards, 4 
drivers
*	Route unchanged: Westgate ? Stagwood Grove ? Westgate Pass ? 
Cliffside ? Pax Tharkas
Prisoners confirmed:
*	50 people (mostly from recent raids on villages)
*	Weakened but mobile (can walk with assistance)
*	Mix of ages (no young children fortunately, but teens to elderly)
*	Desperate (they'll cooperate once freed)
Guards confirmed:
*	Sergeant Krell commanding (competent, routine-oriented)
*	4 veterans (experienced, better equipped)
*	8 regulars (adequate, complacent)
*	Drivers not combatants (will flee if attacked)
 
THE AMBUSH SITE - WESTGATE PASS
Tanis the ranger speaks up, pointing to the map:
"I've scouted Westgate Pass personally. The narrow section is perfect for 
ambush."
He describes: "The road narrows to 10 feet, cliffs rise 60+ feet on both sides. 
Rocky outcroppings provide elevated firing positions. The convoy will be 
strung out-single file passage through the tightest section."
He marks positions on the map:
"Position Alpha (west side, 40 feet up): Johannes, Kessa, Tanis. Ranged 
attackers with elevation advantage.
Position Beta (east side, 30 feet up): Garrett, Finn, Cole. Flanking fire, can 
descend quickly.
Position Gamma (road level, rear approach): Rickard, Tomms, Olev. Block 
retreat, engage guards who flee.
Support (Position Alpha with casters): Goldmoon. Healing, buffs, emergency 
divine intervention."
 
TACTICAL EXECUTION
Laurana outlines the plan:
Phase 1 - Ambush Initiation:
*	Convoy enters kill zone (narrow pass section)
*	Wait until all three wagons are in the zone (no escape forward or back)
*	Johannes initiates with Eldritch Blast on Sergeant Krell (remove 
leadership)
*	Kessa and Tanis provide covering fire (suppress guards)
*	Garrett's team engages from opposite side (crossfire)
Phase 2 - Shock and Awe:
*	Overwhelming firepower in first 6 seconds (surprise round)
*	Target veterans first (biggest threats)
*	Drivers flee (let them go, non-combatants)
*	Prisoners stay in wagon (locked, protected from crossfire)
Phase 3 - Mop-Up:
*	Eliminate or capture remaining guards
*	Secure wagons
*	Free prisoners
*	Treat wounded (Goldmoon's role)
Phase 4 - Extraction:
*	Head northwest toward Haven (pre-planned route)
*	Support teams waiting at safe houses
*	Wagons transport those who can't walk
*	Arrive Haven in 4-5 days
 
CONTINGENCIES
Captain Morna addresses backup plans:
"If things go wrong:
Reinforcements arrive: Signal flares, we have rangers positioned 2 miles 
out who can create diversionary attacks.
Too many casualties: Goldmoon stabilizes wounded, team conducts 
fighting retreat, Haven sends rescue force.
Prisoners can't travel: We have emergency safe house 1 day northwest, can 
shelter there while organizing transport.
Dragon or wyvern appears: Everyone scatters into terrain (mountains, 
caves), regroup at Rally Point Bravo (marked on maps).
Mission abort criteria: If convoy has more than 20 guards, if 
dragon/wyvern escort present, if terrain is compromised."
 
EQUIPMENT AND SUPPLIES
Thoric Ironforge presents mission loadout:
For the team:
*	Healing potions (10 total, distributed)
*	Alchemist's fire (4 flasks)
*	Smoke bombs (6)
*	Rope, climbing gear (for elevation positions)
*	Signal flares (3 sets)
*	Lock-breaking tools (for prison wagon)
*	Rations for 15 people, 7 days
*	Medical supplies (bandages, splints, antitoxin)
For freed prisoners (waiting at first safe house):
*	Food and water (enough for 50 people)
*	Blankets and basic clothing
*	Medical support team
*	Transport wagons (for those too weak to walk)
 
GOLDMOON'S BLESSING
The cleric of Mishakal steps forward. She's carrying a staff topped with the 
blue crystal disk-the symbol of her goddess.
"Before you depart, I offer Mishakal's blessing."
She touches each team member, speaking prayers of protection and healing.
When she reaches you, she pauses. Her eyes study you-not suspicious, 
but... knowing.
"You carry a heavy burden, Johannes Constantinius. I sense darkness bound 
to you, but also..." She touches your chest where the Disks of Mishakal rest 
hidden in your Bag of Holding.
Her eyes widen slightly. "Light. Powerful light. Hidden, but present."
She doesn't press, doesn't question. Just nods and completes the blessing.
"May Mishakal guide your path and grant you mercy."
 
DEPARTURE - TOMORROW AT DAWN
Laurana concludes the briefing:
"You leave at dawn. Three days to reach the ambush point, one day to set 
positions. The convoy enters the pass on Day 5 of your deployment."
She looks at each of you. "This is our first coordinated strike with a full team. 
Saltmere was infiltration. Gharash was assassination. This is combat -real 
battle with lives depending on execution."
"But I have complete faith in this team. You've all proven yourselves. Now we 
prove the resistance can win together."
She raises a cup. "To victory. To freedom. To the fifty souls we're bringing 
home."
The team echoes: "To freedom."
 
THAT EVENING
Kessa finds you on Haven's walls, looking out at the valley.
"Goldmoon knows about the Disks," she says quietly. "Or at least suspects 
something."
She leans on the wall beside you. "Eventually you'll have to decide what to do 
with them. Laurana, Goldmoon, someone else... or keep them."
A pause. "But that's for later. Tomorrow, we've got a convoy to hit and people 
to save."
She grins. "Just like old times. You, me, impossible odds, and a plan that's 
probably going to get complicated."
 
READY TO DEPLOY?

Dec 7
CONVERSATION WITH GOLDMOON
FINDING THE CLERIC
After the evening meal, you seek out Goldmoon. She's in the Haven temple-a 
modest structure, but filled with the peaceful presence of Mishakal's faith.
She's tending to patients-refugees with various ailments, injuries from 
training, the sick and elderly. Her hands glow with soft blue light as she 
channels healing magic.
She looks up as you enter. "Johannes. I wondered if you'd come."
She finishes with her current patient-an elderly woman with a fever-then 
gestures to a quiet corner.
"Walk with me."
 
THE TEMPLE GARDEN
She leads you outside to a small garden behind the temple. Spring flowers are 
beginning to bloom. The evening air is cool and peaceful.
Goldmoon speaks first:
"I felt it during the blessing. The Disks of Mishakal." She says it matter-of-
factly, not accusatory. "They're ancient, powerful artifacts of my goddess. And 
you carry them."
She turns to face you, her expression curious but not hostile. "Most would see 
that as... unusual. A warlock with a fiendish pact carrying divine relics of 
healing and protection."
She pauses, studying you carefully. "But Mishakal's guidance tells me 
there's more to your story. The darkness I sense isn't you-it's something 
bound to you. And the Disks... they protect you from it, don't they?"
 
HER UNDERSTANDING
Insight Check (Goldmoon reading you): 18 + 5 = 23
She sees past your defenses-not invasively, but with the clarity of someone 
who serves a goddess of healing and truth.
"You didn't steal them. Someone gave them to you. Someone who judged 
you worthy despite your curse." She tilts her head. "A dragon, perhaps? Only 
they would have such artifacts hidden away."
She doesn't wait for confirmation. "And you've been carrying them, 
protecting them, waiting to find someone who deserves them more than you 
need their protection."
A soft smile. "That's why you wear the Ring of Mind Shielding now. So you 
can give the Disks away without being vulnerable to your patron."
 
THE QUESTION
She sits on a garden bench, gesturing for you to join her.
"So here's what I'm wondering, Johannes: Why haven't you given them 
away yet?"
"Laurana leads a real resistance. She's worthy-honorable, brave, selfless. She 
fights for others, not for power."
"I serve Mishakal directly. I've devoted my life to healing and protecting the 
innocent. I would certainly use the Disks well."
"Yet you still carry them. So either..." She counts on her fingers:
"One: You haven't decided who's truly worthy.
Two: You're not ready to let go of the protection they provide, despite the 
Ring.
Three: You're waiting for the right moment rather than the right person.
Four: Something else I'm not seeing."
She looks at you directly, kind but probing. "Which is it? Or am I 
completely wrong about everything?"
 
THE SPACE TO ANSWER
She's given you room to speak honestly. No judgment in her voice, just 
genuine curiosity and pastoral care.
The garden is quiet. Private. Safe.
This is a moment where you can:
*	Tell her the full truth (the curse, Khisanth, your promise, your 
hesitation)
*	Partial truth (some details, not everything)
*	Deflect (thank her for understanding, but maintain privacy)
*	Ask her opinion (what would she do in your situation?)
*	Offer her the Disks (if you've decided she's worthy)
*	Offer them to Laurana (if you've decided differently)
*	Explain why you're still holding them
What does Johannes say to Goldmoon?
Worthy of? So subjective... tell the full story. But don't commit to giving
Dec 7
THE FULL STORY
JOHANNES'S CONFESSION
You sit beside her on the bench, looking out at the spring flowers. The words 
come slowly at first, then faster as the weight of carrying this alone lifts 
slightly.
 
THE BEGINNING - THE CURSE
"It started in the military. My patrol discovered something we shouldn't 
have-a tome, ancient and cursed. I was the only one who could read the 
script. I thought I was being careful, thought I understood what I was doing."
You pause. "Everyone in my company died within days. Everyone except me. 
Because I'd already made the pact-traded my soul for power, bound myself to 
a fiendish patron who demanded tribute."
"The curse spread to anyone who stayed near me too long. Unless I paid the 
yearly price-magical artifacts, items of power, fed to the demon to sustain the 
bargain."
Goldmoon listens without interruption, her expression 
compassionate.
"That's why I travel with Kessa-she knows. She understands the risk. And we 
keep moving, never staying long enough for the curse to harm others."
 
XAK TSAROTH - THE DRAGON
"We came to Xak Tsaroth tracking Dragon Army activity. Found more than 
soldiers-found an ancient black dragon named Khisanth ruling the ruins."
You shake your head, still somewhat amazed by the memory. "She was evil, 
yes. But lawful evil. Logical. Honorable in her own way. We negotiated rather 
than fought."
"She had the Disks of Mishakal-had been guarding them, using them for her 
own purposes. But she recognized something in me. Saw that I kept my word, 
that I had... principles, despite the curse."
You look at Goldmoon. "She gave them to me with one instruction: Find 
someone worthy to wield them. Someone who will fight darkness, protect 
innocents, stand against tyranny."
"An evil dragon trusted me to make that judgment. Not because I'm good-but 
because I'm reliable. Because my word means something."
 
THE DISKS' PROTECTION
"The Disks do more than just sit in my bag. They provide divine protection-
they mute my patron's voice. Shield me from his influence. Make it possible 
to think clearly, to make choices that aren't tainted by demonic whispers."
"For months, they were my only protection. The only thing standing between 
me and complete corruption."
You touch the Ring of Mind Shielding on your finger. "But then we raided 
Voss's estate. Found this ring. It protects my thoughts, blocks scrying, keeps 
my mind my own."
"So technically, I don't need the Disks anymore for protection. I could give 
them away and maintain my independence through the Ring."
 
THE HESITATION
"So why haven't I?" You lean forward, elbows on knees. "That's the question 
you're asking. And honestly? I'm not entirely sure."
You organize your thoughts:
"Part of it is timing. We've been in constant motion-Saltmere, Gharash, 
winter in Solace, now this operation. Every time I think 'this is the moment,' 
something else demands attention."
"Part of it is certainty. Laurana is worthy, yes. She's brave, selfless, fights 
for others. But is she the most worthy? What if there's someone else-
someone the Disks would serve better? A true cleric, perhaps. Someone like 
you. What if I give them to the wrong person and waste what an ancient 
dragon entrusted to me?"
**"Part of it is..." You struggle with this. "Attachment. Not to the 
protection-the Ring handles that. But to the responsibility. Khisanth 
gave me this task. Said I was worthy of making the judgment. If I give the 
Disks away, I've completed that trust. And then what? I'm just a cursed 
warlock again, nothing special, no greater purpose."
You look at Goldmoon directly. "That sounds selfish when I say it out loud."
 
THE DEEPER TRUTH
"But here's what really keeps me from deciding: What does 'worthy' even 
mean?"
You gesture broadly. "Laurana is a princess-turned-commander, leading 
refugees, building a resistance. Worthy of respect, certainly. Worthy of trust, 
absolutely."
"You're a cleric who serves Mishakal directly, healing the sick, protecting the 
innocent, channeling divine power for good. Hard to argue you're not worthy."
"Garrett was a guard who stood by while people were enslaved, but then chose 
to risk everything to make it right. Is redemption a form of worthiness?"
"The fifty prisoners we're going to free tomorrow-they've suffered, endured, 
survived. Are they worthy simply by virtue of their courage?"
You shake your head. "Khisanth said 'find someone worthy.' But she's 
a dragon. Their sense of worthiness is about power, knowledge, capability. 
She'd probably say Laurana is worthy because she achieves results."
"But Mishakal might judge worthiness differently-by compassion, 
selflessness, devotion."
"And I'm caught between those two definitions, trying to judge by standards I 
don't fully understand."
 
THE WEIGHT
"So I carry them. Month after month. Telling myself I'm waiting for clarity, for 
the right moment, for certainty."
"But maybe I'm just afraid of making the wrong choice. Afraid of 
disappointing a dragon who trusted me. Afraid of giving away something 
powerful to someone who might misuse it-or worse, fail because I gave it to 
them instead of someone better."
You look at Goldmoon. "That's the truth. Not heroic. Not particularly wise. 
Just... honest."
 
GOLDMOON'S RESPONSE
She's quiet for a long moment, processing everything you've said.
Then she speaks, her voice gentle:
"Thank you for trusting me with this. The curse, the dragon, the burden of 
choice-that's... immense. And you've been carrying it largely alone."
She stands, paces slowly through the garden.
"Here's what I think, Johannes. And this is just my opinion, not Mishakal's 
command or anything divine:"
 
HER PERSPECTIVE
"First: The fact that you're agonizing over who's worthy means 
you are worthy of making the judgment. Someone unworthy wouldn't care-
they'd keep the Disks for themselves, or give them away carelessly, or sell 
them for gold."
"Second: I don't think Khisanth meant for you to find the most worthy 
person in all of Krynn. She meant for you to find someone who would use 
them well. Someone who would fight darkness with them, protect people 
with them. The Disks aren't meant to sit in a vault-they're meant to be used."
"Third: You're right that 'worthy' is subjective. But maybe that's the 
point. You get to define it. Not the dragon, not Mishakal, not me. The 
judgment is yours because the trust was placed in you."
She turns back to you. "Fourth: I don't think you're holding onto them out of 
selfishness. I think you're holding onto them out of fear of failure. Fear of 
choosing wrong. And that's understandable-but it's also paralyzing."
 
HER ADVICE
"Here's my suggestion: Stop looking for the perfect choice. Look for 
a good choice."
"Laurana would use the Disks to protect her people, to lead with wisdom, to 
stand against tyranny. That's good."
"I would use them to heal, to protect the innocent, to channel Mishakal's 
power more effectively. That's also good."
"Garrett or the freed prisoners... honestly, they probably wouldn't know how 
to use divine artifacts. So that's probably not the right choice-but it was 
worth considering."
She sits back down beside you. "The Disks will serve whoever carries them. 
The question isn't 'who is most worthy?' The question is 'who needs them most 
to do the work that needs doing?'"
"And only you can answer that. Because you're the one who sees the whole 
picture-who knows Laurana, who knows me, who knows what battles are 
coming."
 
THE CHALLENGE
"So here's my challenge to you, Johannes:"
"Tomorrow, we go into battle. Fifty lives depend on us succeeding. After that 
battle-after you've seen how Laurana leads, how the team fights, how we all 
work together-make your decision."
"Not the perfect decision. Just a good decision."
"Give the Disks to whoever you think will use them well. And then trust that 
Khisanth was right to trust you."
She stands. "Or don't. Keep them longer if you need to. But stop punishing 
yourself for not having made the choice yet. The burden is heavy enough 
without adding guilt on top."
 
THE OFFER
She places a hand on your shoulder. "If you decide I'm the right choice, I'll 
accept them with honor and use them as Mishakal intends. If you decide 
Laurana is right, I'll support that completely. If you decide someone else 
entirely, or to wait longer, I'll respect that."
"But whatever you choose-stop carrying this alone. You have Kessa. You 
have me. You have this team. We're here."
She smiles warmly. "Now get some rest. Tomorrow, we remind the Dragon 
Army that resistance has teeth."
 
THE NIGHT
She returns to the temple, leaving you in the garden with your thoughts.
The Disks rest in your Bag of Holding.
The choice remains unmade.
But perhaps, after tomorrow's battle, clarity will come.
 
DAWN APPROACHES
Ready to deploy for Operation Westgate?
Or is there anything else you want to address before the mission begins?
Nope
Dec 7
OPERATION WESTGATE - 
DEPLOYMENT
DAWN - DAY 1
The strike team assembles in Haven's courtyard as the first light breaks over 
the valley.
Ten fighters, fully equipped:
*	Johannes & Kessa
*	Garrett, Rickard, Finn, Cole, Tomms, Olev
*	Tanis (ranger)
*	Goldmoon (cleric)
Laurana addresses the team one final time:
"You know the mission. You know the stakes. Fifty lives depend on your 
success. The resistance's credibility depends on showing we can execute 
coordinated operations."
She looks at each of you. "Strike hard. Strike clean. Bring our people home."
Captain Morna adds: "Support teams are positioned along the escape 
route. Signal if you need help. We'll be ready."
 
THE MARCH - DAYS 1-3
Day 1:
*	Leave Haven at dawn
*	Travel southeast toward Westgate Pass region
*	Make 25 miles, camp in forest clearing
*	Team morale: High, confident, focused
Goldmoon's evening prayer: She blesses the camp, channels healing 
energy to refresh everyone for tomorrow.
Day 2:
*	Continue toward mountains
*	Terrain becomes rougher (foothills)
*	20 miles, camp at base of mountain pass
*	Tanis scouts ahead, confirms route clear
Kessa's observation: "Dragon Army patrols are light here. They don't 
expect resistance this far from major settlements."
Day 3:
*	Enter mountain terrain
*	Final 15 miles to ambush site
*	Slower progress (elevation, rocky ground)
*	Arrive at Westgate Pass by late afternoon
 
WESTGATE PASS - THE AMBUSH SITE
Tanis leads you to the perfect location:
The pass narrows dramatically-walls of stone rising 60+ feet on both sides, 
road only 10 feet wide, rocky outcroppings providing elevated positions.
"This is it," Tanis says, pointing. "The convoy will enter from the east, strung 
out single-file through this section. Once all three wagons are in, they're 
trapped."
 
DAY 4 - SETTING POSITIONS
The team spends the day preparing:

THAT EVENING - EVE OF BATTLE
The team camps in a hidden position 200 yards from the ambush site. No fires 
(can't risk being seen). Cold rations, quiet conversation.
Garrett approaches you: "Like Saltmere, but bigger. And this time we're 
fighting alongside you, not just supporting." He grins nervously. "Still feels 
like we're going to pull it off though. You've got that effect."
Goldmoon sits in meditation, blue light occasionally glowing from 
her staff as she prays.
Tanis checks his bow for the dozenth time-ranger's ritual before 
combat.
Kessa sits beside you, cleaning her hand crossbow. "Tomorrow 
morning, convoy enters the pass around mid-morning based on their 
schedule. We'll hear them before we see them-wagons on stone, guards 
talking, prisoners probably silent."
She looks at you. "You ready?"
 
FINAL TACTICAL CHECK
Mission parameters:
*	Timing: Convoy expected mid-morning tomorrow (10-11 AM)
*	Enemies: 1 sergeant, 4 veterans, 8 regular guards, 4 non-combatant 
drivers
*	Objectives: Eliminate guards, free 50 prisoners, capture supplies, 
extract northwest
*	Backup: Haven support teams positioned along escape route
*	Abort conditions: More than 20 guards, dragon/wyvern escort, 
terrain compromised
Strike Team Status:
*	All fighters healthy, rested, equipped
*	Positions prepared and sighted
*	Communication signals established
*	Escape routes planned
*	Morale: Confident, focused, ready
 
THE NIGHT BEFORE
You stand watch with Kessa during third shift (midnight to 3 
AM). The stars are brilliant, the mountains silent except for wind through 
rocks.
"This is what we're good at," she says quietly. "Hitting them where they're 
vulnerable, freeing people who can't free themselves, making the Dragon 
Army bleed."
"Tomorrow, fifty more people go home. And Verminaard loses supplies, 
morale, and the illusion of safety."
She checks her weapons one more time. "Get some sleep. Tomorrow's a 
big day."
 
DAWN - DAY 5 (CONVOY DAY)
First light breaks over the mountains.
The team moves to positions quietly, efficiently. No last-minute speeches 
needed-everyone knows their role.
Position Alpha: Johannes, Kessa, Tanis, Goldmoon - elevated, ready 
Position Beta: Garrett, Finn, Cole - elevated opposite side, waiting 
Position Gamma: Rickard, Tomms, Olev - ground level, concealed
 
THE WAIT
Hours pass. The sun climbs. Morning becomes late morning.
Perception Check (Tanis - listening for approach): 19 + 5 = 24
"I hear them," Tanis whispers. "Maybe two miles out. Wagons, horses, 
metal on stone. Talking-casual, not alert."
Fifteen minutes later, you hear it too. The rumble of wagon wheels, the 
clomp of horses, guards making jokes about last night's dice game.
They're coming.
 
VISUAL CONFIRMATION
Through the pass entrance, you see them:
Lead wagon (supply wagon):
*	2 horses, 1 driver
*	2 guards walking alongside (regulars)
*	1 veteran guard on horseback (outrider)
Prison wagon (middle):
*	4 horses (heavy load), 1 driver
*	Reinforced cage, 50 prisoners visible inside (crowded, miserable)
*	Sergeant Krell riding beside wagon
*	2 veteran guards walking alongside
Supply wagon (rear):
*	2 horses, 1 driver
*	3 regular guards walking alongside
*	1 veteran guard on horseback (rear guard)
Additional:
*	3 regular guards spread along column (perimeter watch)
*	1 driver walking beside lead horses
Total count matches intelligence:
*	Sergeant Krell ?
*	4 veterans ?
*	8 regulars ?
*	4 drivers (non-combatants) ?
No surprises. No additional forces. Plan proceeds.
 
ENTERING THE KILL ZONE
The convoy begins entering the narrow section. Single file, strung out over 100 
feet.
Lead wagon enters... 
Guards walking beside it... 
Prison wagon approaching the center...
Tanis holds up his hand: Wait... wait...
Rear wagon entering now...
The entire convoy is in the kill zone.
Tanis looks at you: Your call, Commander.
 
THE MOMENT
From your elevated position, you have perfect line of sight on:
*	Sergeant Krell (riding beside prison wagon, 45 feet away)
*	All four veterans (distributed along column)
*	The regular guards (scattered)
*	Clear sky above (no dragon, no wyvern)
*	Prisoners in cage (visible, terrified, hopeful if they could see you)
The team waits for your signal.
Kessa has her hand crossbow aimed at a veteran.
Goldmoon whispers a prayer, ready to act.
Garrett, across the pass, catches your eye and nods.
 
INITIATE AMBUSH?
How do you start this?
Options:
*	Target Sergeant Krell first (remove leadership immediately)
*	Target veterans first (eliminate biggest threats)
*	Signal for simultaneous volley (everyone fires together)
*	Something else
And specifically - what's your first action?
Simultaneous attack.

*	Hex Damage: 5 necrotic
*	Total: 19 damage
The bolt punches through the wagon side and catches him as he takes cover. 
He screams.
Second Bolt:
*	Attack Roll: 12 + 7 = 19 ? HIT
*	Damage: 7 + 4 (Agonizing) = 11 force
*	Hex Damage: 4 necrotic
*	Total: 15 damage
The second blast hits him center mass. He's thrown backward, dead before he 
hits the ground.
ALL FOUR VETERANS ELIMINATED.
 
ROUND 1 - GARRETT'S GROUP
The three of them focus fire on the wounded guards below.
Garrett (targeting Regular Guard #1 - already wounded 8 HP):
*	Heavy Crossbow: 16 + 5 = 21 ? HIT
*	Damage: 8 + 2 = 10 damage
*	Guard #1 DEAD
Finn (targeting Regular Guard #4 - wounded 7 HP):
*	Crossbow: 14 + 4 = 18 ? HIT
*	Damage: 6 + 2 = 8 damage
*	Guard #4 DEAD
Cole (targeting Regular Guard #5 - wounded 9 HP):
*	Crossbow: 13 + 4 = 17 ? HIT
*	Damage: 7 + 2 = 9 damage
*	Guard #5 DEAD
"Three more down!" Garrett shouts.
 
ROUND 1 - REMAINING GUARDS' TURN
Only 3 regular guards left alive (Guards #6, #7, #8).
They've seen:
*	Sergeant dead
*	All four veterans dead
*	Five fellow guards dead
*	Invisible attackers from the rocks
*	Total slaughter in 12 seconds
Morale Checks (DC 15 to stay and fight):
*	Guard #6: 4 + 0 = 4 (FAILS - flees)
*	Guard #7: 7 + 0 = 7 (FAILS - flees)
*	Guard #8: 6 + 0 = 6 (FAILS - flees)
ALL THREE DROP THEIR WEAPONS AND RUN.
They sprint south down the pass, following the drivers, screaming 
incoherently.
 
ROUND 1 - RICKARD'S GROUP
They're positioned to intercept fleeing enemies.
Rickard calls out: "Let them run or drop them?"
His question is directed at you-commander's call.
Do you:
1.	Let them flee (they're broken, not a threat, will spread fear)
2.	Kill them (no survivors, no intelligence back to Dragon Army)
3.	Capture them (interrogation, but requires effort)
What's your order?

Dec 7
ROUND 1 - CAPTURE ORDER
YOUR COMMAND
"Take them alive!" you shout down. "No killing-we need prisoners for 
intelligence!"
 
RICKARD'S GROUP - INTERCEPTION
The three fleeing guards are running directly toward Position 
Gamma.
Rickard: "Non-lethal! Trip them up!"
RICKARD:
*	Drops crossbow, draws club
*	Attack (aiming to incapacitate Guard #6): 15 + 5 = 20 ? HIT
*	Non-lethal damage: 7 bludgeoning
*	Guard #6 stumbles, dazed but still moving
TOMMS:
*	Tackles Guard #7 from the side
*	Athletics Check: 16 + 3 = 19 vs Guard's 8
*	SUCCESS - Guard #7 goes down hard, pinned
OLEV:
*	Throws rope net (prepared equipment)
*	Dexterity Check: 14 + 2 = 16 vs Guard #8's 10
*	SUCCESS - Guard #8 entangled in net, falls, struggling
 
ROUND 1 - GOLDMOON'S TURN
She sees the guards being captured, scans for wounded allies.
"We're all clear!" she calls out. "No friendly casualties!"
She begins climbing down from Position Alpha toward the prison wagon.
"Let's free those prisoners!"
 
ROUND 1 COMPLETE - AFTERMATH
Total Combat Time: 12 seconds (2 rounds)
Enemy Casualties:
*	DEAD: Sergeant Krell, 4 Veterans, 5 Regular Guards (10 total)
*	CAPTURED: 3 Regular Guards (alive, subdued)
*	FLED: 4 wagon drivers (non-combatants, let them go)
Friendly Casualties:
*	ZERO
Perfect execution. Overwhelming victory.
 
SECURING THE SCENE
The team descends from positions, moving efficiently:
Kessa and Tanis check bodies, confirm kills, collect weapons and 
equipment.
Garrett's group secures the three captured guards-binding hands, 
confiscating weapons, setting them aside under watch.
Rickard's group approaches the prison wagon carefully, weapons ready in 
case of surprises.
You and Goldmoon move toward the caged prisoners.
 
THE PRISON WAGON
Fifty faces press against the bars.
Men and women, young and old, humans and elves and a few dwarves. Filthy, 
exhausted, terrified-but now hopeful as they see you approaching.
An older human man at the front bars speaks, voice hoarse:
"Are you... are you really here? Or is this some cruel trick?"
A younger elf woman beside him: "We heard fighting. We heard screams. 
We thought they were killing each other or-"
She stops as she sees Goldmoon's staff with the blue crystal disk, the symbol of 
Mishakal glowing softly.
"A cleric. A real cleric." Tears stream down her face. "We're saved. We're 
actually saved."
 
GOLDMOON'S PRESENCE
She approaches the wagon, staff raised, divine light emanating.
"You are safe now. The Dragon Army guards are dead or captured. 
We're taking you to Haven-to freedom."
The reaction is immediate-sobbing, prayers, people collapsing against the 
bars in relief.
Goldmoon turns to you: "We need to get them out, check for injuries, 
provide food and water. Some look near collapse."
 
KESSA'S REPORT
She approaches with an inventory:
"Supplies secured:
*	Two wagons of Dragon Army equipment (food, mining tools, weapons, 
armor)
*	Prison wagon (reinforced but we can break it open)
*	Horses still hitched (panicked but manageable)
*	Guards' weapons and armor (quality stuff)
*	Three prisoners for interrogation"
She grins. "This is a haul. Verminaard just lost serious resources."
 
GARRETT'S ASSESSMENT
"The three captured guards are terrified. They'll talk-guaranteed. 
Want me to start questioning them while you handle the 
prisoners?"
He looks at the prison wagon. "We pulled it off. Just like you said we 
would. Zero casualties on our side, total victory."
His brothers Finn and Cole are already checking the supply wagons, cataloging 
what was captured.
 
TANIS'S TACTICAL UPDATE
The ranger climbs down from his position.
"Pass is secure. No reinforcements visible. The drivers who fled are 
miles away by now-they won't stop running until they hit Westgate 
or Pax Tharkas."
"But we should move soon. When this convoy doesn't arrive at Pax 
Tharkas on schedule, they'll send scouts. We want to be long gone 
with these people before that happens."
 
IMMEDIATE TASKS
You have multiple priorities:
1.	Free the 50 prisoners (break open cage, provide immediate care)
2.	Interrogate captured guards (get intelligence on Dragon Army 
operations)
3.	Secure supplies (inventory what you captured)
4.	Treat any prisoner injuries (Goldmoon's healing, medical supplies)
5.	Begin evacuation (start moving toward Haven)
6.	Signal success (send flare to Haven support teams)
What do you prioritize first?
And specifically:
*	Do you want to personally supervise prisoner liberation?
*	Do you want to interrogate the captured guards yourself?
*	Do you delegate and coordinate everything?
What's your immediate action?
Delegate.
Dec 7
DELEGATION - COMMAND 
DECISIONS
COORDINATING THE TEAM
You gather the team leaders quickly, issuing clear orders:
 
ASSIGNMENTS
"Goldmoon, Kessa-handle the prisoners."
"Get that cage open. Goldmoon provides healing for anyone critical. Kessa, 
organize them-assess who can walk, who needs carrying, get them water and 
food. Priority is keeping them calm and getting them ready to move."
Goldmoon nods. "I'll tend the wounded first, then we'll get everyone 
stabilized."
Kessa salutes mockingly. "Medical and logistics. On it."
 
"Garrett, your team-secure and inventory the supply wagons."
"Catalog what we captured. Prioritize anything immediately useful-food, 
medical supplies, weapons we can redistribute. Figure out what we're taking 
versus what we're destroying."
Garrett grins. "On it, Commander. Finn, Cole-let's see what the Dragon 
Army was generous enough to donate."
 
"Rickard-interrogate the captured guards."
"You served under Gharash, you know how they think. Get intelligence: Pax 
Tharkas status, troop movements, when this convoy was expected, what 
happens when it doesn't arrive. Use whatever methods you need short of 
permanent harm."
Rickard's expression hardens. "They'll talk. I guarantee it." He heads 
toward the three bound guards.
 
"Tanis-security and scouting."
"Perimeter watch. Make sure no scouts or patrols are approaching. Once we 
start moving, I need you ranging ahead, making sure our route to the first safe 
house is clear."
Tanis nods curtly. "I'll climb back up, get a wide view of the approaches. 
Any movement within two miles, you'll know."
 
"Tomms, Olev-prepare for evacuation."
"Get the horses calmed and hitched properly. We're taking all three wagons-
two for supplies, one for prisoners who can't walk. Clear the road of bodies, 
make sure we can move quickly when ready."
Tomms: "Understood. We'll have everything ready to roll in thirty minutes."
 
COORDINATED EFFICIENCY
The team disperses, each to their task.
You watch from the center of the kill zone as your operation unfolds:
*	Goldmoon's blue healing light glows around the prison wagon as 
she channels divine energy
*	Kessa's voice, calm and authoritative, organizing prisoners
*	Garrett and his brothers pulling crates from supply wagons, 
inventorying
*	Rickard dragging the three captured guards aside, beginning 
interrogation
*	Tanis already climbing back to elevated position for overwatch
*	Tomms and Olev working with the horses, clearing debris
Professional. Organized. Effective.
 
TWENTY MINUTES LATER - STATUS REPORTS
GOLDMOON'S REPORT
She approaches, slightly winded from channeling healing magic.
"Prisoners are in better shape than expected-physically, at least. 
Most are malnourished and exhausted, but mobile."
Medical Assessment:
*	5 critically weak (elderly or sick, need wagon transport)
*	12 moderately weak (can walk with assistance)
*	33 able to walk (tired but functional)
*	Zero life-threatening injuries (Dragon Army kept them alive for 
labor value)
"I've healed the worst cases. Everyone's had water. Kessa's getting 
them organized into travel groups."
She pauses. "They're traumatized. Some were taken from their 
homes days ago, others weeks. They've seen brutality, lost family 
members. They need more than just physical healing."
"But they're grateful. And they trust us. When we say 'follow us to 
Haven,' they'll follow."
 
KESSA'S REPORT
She wipes sweat from her brow, clearly having worked hard organizing chaos.
"Prisoners are grouped and ready to move:
Group 1 (The Strong): 33 people who can walk unassisted 
Group 2 (The Assisted): 12 people needing support (we'll pair them with 
Group 1) 
Group 3 (Wagon Transport): 5 people riding in the prison wagon (we've 
removed the locks, made it comfortable as possible)
"We've distributed all our rations-everyone's eaten something, 
had water. Morale is... complicated. Relief, fear, hope, exhaustion 
all mixed together."
Leadership identified: "There's a village elder named Theron-human 
male, late 50s. He's naturally taken charge of organizing people. Good leader, 
keeping them calm. Suggested we work with him to coordinate the march."
 
GARRETT'S REPORT
He carries a ledger, grinning widely.
"Commander, this is a jackpot:"
Supply Wagon #1:
*	Food rations (enough for 100 people, 2 weeks)
*	Medical supplies (bandages, herbs, basic medicines)
*	Mining equipment (picks, shovels, lamps-destined for Pax Tharkas)
*	Rope, chains, general supplies
Supply Wagon #2:
*	Weapons and armor (20 longswords, 15 spears, 10 crossbows, 
ammunition)
*	Dragon Army uniforms (might be useful for infiltration)
*	Officer's correspondence (sealed letters, orders-intelligence)
*	Strong box with 150 gold pieces (payroll for Pax Tharkas guards)
"We're taking everything. The weapons we'll distribute-some to 
prisoners who can fight, rest to Haven. The food keeps everyone 
fed on the march. The intelligence..." He taps the sealed letters. 
"That's probably valuable."
 
RICKARD'S REPORT
The veteran approaches, expression grim but satisfied.
"The guards talked. Didn't take much-they're conscripts, not 
fanatics."
Intelligence Gathered:
Convoy Schedule:
*	Expected at Pax Tharkas tomorrow evening
*	When they don't arrive, scouts will be sent within 12 hours
*	Full search party dispatched within 24 hours
Pax Tharkas Status:
*	Verminaard currently absent (campaign in the north)
*	Ember the red dragon also absent (with Verminaard)
*	Fortress at reduced alert (routine operations)
*	Approximately 600 soldiers currently garrisoned
*	Prisoners total ~700 in the mines
This Convoy Specifically:
*	50 prisoners from recent village raids
*	Supplies for 2 weeks of operations
*	Part of weekly supply rotation
Guard Morale:
*	Many conscripts are unhappy (forced service)
*	Officers are brutal (fear keeps them in line)
*	Desertions happen but are punished severely
Rickard's assessment: "We have maybe 36 hours before Dragon Army 
realizes this convoy is gone and starts searching seriously. Need to be well 
away from here by then."
 
TANIS'S REPORT
He descends from overwatch position.
"All clear. No patrols, no scouts, no movement within visual 
range."
"Road northwest to the first safe house is open. Estimate 8 hours 
march with this many people-we'll arrive after dark but that's 
acceptable."
"Recommend we move within the hour. Longer we stay here, 
higher the risk."
 
SIGNAL TO HAVEN
Garrett holds up the signal flares. "Should I signal success to Haven? Let 
them know we're coming with 50 freed prisoners?"
 
FINAL DECISIONS BEFORE DEPARTURE
You need to decide:
1.	Signal Haven now? (Confirms success, alerts support teams)
2.	What to do with captured guards?
*	Take them as prisoners (slow us down)
*	Release them (they'll report back to Dragon Army)
*	Execute them (harsh but prevents intelligence leak)
*	Leave them bound here (they'll eventually free themselves)
3.	Destroy evidence?
*	Burn the wagons we're not taking
*	Scatter bodies
*	Make it look like different attackers
*	Leave it as-is (sends message to Dragon Army)
4.	Arm the prisoners?
*	Distribute captured weapons to those who can fight (20 swords, 15 
spears)
*	Keep weapons for Haven's armory
*	Mixed approach
5.	March order and security?
*	Who leads, who guards flanks, who brings up rear
*	How to organize 50+ civilians plus team
What are your orders?
Who's in command with Verminaard away?
Dec 7
INTERROGATION FOLLOW-UP
PRESSING FOR DETAILS
You call Rickard over. "The guards-did they say who's commanding Pax 
Tharkas while Verminaard is away?"
Rickard nods. "Let me get specifics."
He returns to the bound guards, crouches down. You follow to listen directly.
 
THE CAPTURED GUARD'S ANSWER
Guard #6 (the most talkative, eager to cooperate):
"C-Commander Blacksteel. Karthak Blacksteel-he's Verminaard's 
second-in-command at Pax Tharkas."
The guard swallows nervously. "He's... he's a hobgoblin. Big one. Veteran of a 
dozen campaigns. Brutal, smart, loyal to Verminaard absolutely."
Rickard presses: "His capabilities? How does he command?"
Guard #7 (the quieter one, but confirming): "Blacksteel runs the fortress like 
a prison. Strict schedules, harsh punishments, no tolerance for weakness. The 
soldiers fear him. The prisoners... they call him the Iron Torturer."
Guard #6 continues: "But he's not a field commander. He's good 
at holding territory, running operations, managing logistics. Verminaard 
does the conquering-Blacksteel holds what's conquered."
 
ADDITIONAL DETAILS
Rickard asks about numbers:
"How many officers report to Blacksteel at the fortress?"
Guard #6: "Maybe... eight or ten sub-commanders? Each runs a section-
mine operations, prisoner management, supply depot, garrison defense, the 
dragon roost..."
Guard #8 (the previously silent one, now speaking): "And the dark clerics. 
Verminaard's priests of Takhisis. Maybe five of them. They answer to 
Blacksteel when Verminaard's gone, but they've got their own authority. 
Divine magic, dark rituals. They keep the prisoners scared and the soldiers 
obedient."
 
RICKARD'S ASSESSMENT
He stands, moves aside with you.
"So in summary:
Commander Karthak Blacksteel:
*	Hobgoblin veteran
*	Verminaard's garrison commander
*	Specialty: holding territory, not conquering
*	Brutal disciplinarian
*	Competent but not brilliant
Supporting Structure:
*	8-10 sub-commanders (various specialties)
*	~5 dark clerics of Takhisis (divine support)
*	600 soldiers (reduced from normal 800+ when Verminaard is present)
*	Routine operations, not combat alert
Weaknesses:
*	Blacksteel is administrative, not inspirational
*	Without Verminaard and Ember, morale is lower
*	Clerics are powerful but few in number
*	Fortress is designed to hold, not to respond to external threats
Opportunity:
*	If we're going to hit Pax Tharkas, now is the time-Verminaard 
absent, dragon absent, reduced garrison, routine operations."
He looks at you seriously. "But even with those advantages, it's still 600 
soldiers, a fortified position, dark clerics, and a hobgoblin 
commander who's held that fortress for years."
"Not impossible. But not something ten of us can do alone."
 
THE STRATEGIC PICTURE
This intelligence is valuable.
If passed to Laurana:
*	Haven could plan a coordinated assault on Pax Tharkas
*	Timing it while Verminaard is absent
*	Assembling enough force to actually succeed
*	Liberating 700+ prisoners instead of 50
But that's a spring/summer operation requiring:
*	200+ fighters minimum
*	Siege equipment or infiltration plan
*	Coordination with internal prisoner leadership
*	Multiple diversions and support operations
Not today. Not this team. But soon, potentially.
 
BACK TO IMMEDIATE DECISIONS
Rickard asks: "So what do we do with these three? They've given us good 
intel, cooperated fully. But if we let them go, they report everything-our 
numbers, capabilities, direction of escape."
He's waiting for your call on the five questions:
1.	Signal Haven?
2.	Captured guards' fate?
3.	Destroy evidence?
4.	Arm the prisoners?
5.	March organization?
What are your orders, Commander?
Let kessa resolve it
Dec 7
KESSA'S JUDGMENT
CALLING HER OVER
You gesture for Kessa to join you and Rickard near the captured guards.
"Keys, I need your assessment. Three captured guards, cooperated fully, gave 
us valuable intelligence. What do we do with them?"
 
KESSA'S EVALUATION
She studies the three bound men for a long moment-professional assessment, 
no emotion.
Then she crouches down in front of them, meeting their eyes.
"You three. Names."
Guard #6: "Perin." 
Guard #7: "Jorik." 
Guard #8: "Matthis."
"Conscripts or volunteers?"
Perin: "Conscripted. All of us. From villages near Westgate."
Jorik nods. "Dragon Army came through. Said join or die. We joined."
Matthis: "We're not... we're not like the veterans. We didn't want this."
 
KESSA'S QUESTIONS
"Did you hurt the prisoners? Beat them, abuse them, worse?"
All three shake their heads frantically.
Perin: "We walked alongside the wagon. Didn't touch them. That was the 
veterans' job-they enjoyed it. We just... did what we were told to stay alive."
Kessa's eyes narrow. "So you stood by while others did the hurting. That's 
still complicity."
Jorik: "We know. We're not asking for forgiveness. We're just... we have 
families. We didn't choose this."
 
KESSA'S DECISION
She stands, turns to you and Rickard, voice low so the guards can't hear 
clearly:
"Here's what I think:
Option 1 - Execute them: Clean, prevents intelligence leak, sends message. 
But they cooperated, they're conscripts not fanatics, and killing prisoners who 
surrendered sits wrong.
Option 2 - Take them with us: Burden on the march, slows us down, we'd 
have to guard them constantly. Not practical.
Option 3 - Leave them bound: They'll free themselves eventually or be 
found. Delays their report by hours, gives us lead time. Middle ground.
Option 4 - Recruit them: Offer them a choice-come to Haven, join the 
resistance, fight against the Dragon Army that conscripted them. Long shot, 
but..." She glances back at them. "They're terrified of going back. Might 
actually work."
 
HER RECOMMENDATION
"I say Option 4 with a fallback to Option 3."
She explains: "We tell them: You have a choice. Come to Haven with us. Join 
the resistance. Use your knowledge of Dragon Army operations to help us 
free more people like those 50 in the wagon. Or we leave you here, bound, 
and you can explain to Commander Blacksteel how you survived when 
everyone else died."
"If they choose Haven, we gain three people with inside knowledge of Dragon 
Army protocols, bases, supply routes. And we turn Verminaard's conscripts 
into our fighters-that's a win."
"If they refuse, we leave them bound but alive. Not our problem after that."
She looks at you. "But it's your call, Commander. I can make the offer, or 
we can go another direction entirely."
 
RICKARD'S OPINION
"For what it's worth, I agree with Kessa. These aren't the bastards 
who deserve killing-those are already dead. These are scared kids 
who got pressed into service."
"And turning Dragon Army conscripts? That's psychological warfare. Every 
deserter weakens them and strengthens us."
 
THE THREE GUARDS
They're watching you now, understanding that their fate is being decided.
Perin speaks up, voice shaking: "Please. Whatever you decide... just don't 
send us back. They'll execute us for losing the convoy. Torture us first to find 
out what happened, then execute us."
Matthis: "We'd rather take our chances with you than go back there."
 
YOUR DECISION
Do you:
1.	Accept Kessa's recommendation (offer them the choice: Haven or 
leave them bound)
2.	Execute them (harsh but certain)
3.	Leave them bound, no offer (let fate decide)
4.	Something else
What's your call?
1
Dec 7
THE OFFER
KESSA'S PITCH
You nod to Kessa. "Make the offer."
She crouches back down in front of the three bound guards, her voice clear 
and direct:
 
"Here's your situation: Your sergeant is dead. Your veterans are 
dead. Half your unit is dead. This convoy is gone. When 
Commander Blacksteel finds out, he'll want someone to blame."
"You three survived. That makes you suspects. They'll interrogate 
you-painfully. They'll assume you helped us, or fled, or were 
cowards. Best case? You're executed quickly. Worst case? You're 
tortured for information, then executed slowly as an example."
She lets that sink in.
"Or, you come with us to Haven. You join the resistance. You use 
everything you know about Dragon Army-patrol routes, supply 
schedules, base layouts, weak points-to help us free more people. 
To fight the army that conscripted you against your will."
"Haven feeds you. Arms you. Trains you. Gives you a purpose 
beyond 'follow orders or die.' You become part of something that's 
actually fighting back."
She stands. "So choose. Now. Haven with us, or we leave you here 
bound for Blacksteel's men to find. You have ten seconds."
 
THE RESPONSE
Immediate. Unanimous. Desperate.
Perin: "Haven. We'll come to Haven."
Jorik: "Yes. Please. We'll fight with you. We'll help however we can."
Matthis, tears in his eyes: "I never wanted to serve them. Never. If you'll 
have us, we'll prove ourselves. I swear it."
 
KESSA'S CONDITION
"Understand this clearly: You try to run, you betray us, you give 
intelligence back to the Dragon Army-we will hunt you down. And 
I personally will make sure your death is memorable."
"But if you're loyal, if you fight with us, if you help free people like 
those fifty in that wagon? You'll have a home. A purpose. A chance 
to make up for the time you spent marching for Verminaard."
"Agree?"
All three nod frantically. "We agree. We swear."
 
CUTTING THEM LOOSE
Kessa cuts their bonds. They stand slowly, rubbing their wrists, looking 
around at the carnage-their former comrades dead, the freed prisoners, your 
team organizing the evacuation.
Rickard steps forward. "I'm Rickard. Former Dragon Army, just like you. 
Defected months ago. Fought at Saltmere, killed Commander Gharash, and 
now I'm here liberating convoys."
He grips Perin's shoulder. "You made the right choice. Stick with us, follow 
orders, and you'll be fine."
The three look at each other, then back at Rickard with something 
like hope.
 
GOLDMOON'S BLESSING
She approaches the three former guards, staff glowing softly.
"You've chosen the path of redemption. Mishakal sees your hearts. 
She knows you were forced into service, that you did not choose 
cruelty."
She touches each of their foreheads. "Welcome to the resistance. May 
you find purpose in protecting those who cannot protect 
themselves."
The three look stunned-a cleric of Mishakal just blessed them. Former 
Dragon Army conscripts receiving divine grace.
Matthis actually starts crying quietly.
 
IMMEDIATE ASSIGNMENTS
Rickard takes charge of the three: "You'll march with me. Help move 
supplies, assist prisoners who need support, prove yourselves useful. Do that, 
and when we get to Haven, Commander Brightblade will find proper roles for 
you."
To you: "I'll keep them close. Watch them. But I think they're genuine, 
Commander. They've got the same look I had when I defected-relief mixed 
with terror."
 
FINAL PRE-DEPARTURE DECISIONS
With the guard situation resolved, you still need to decide:
1.	Signal Haven now? (Alert support teams we're coming)
2.	Destroy evidence?
*	Burn abandoned equipment
*	Leave bodies as-is
*	Make it ambiguous who attacked
3.	Arm the prisoners?
*	Distribute captured weapons (20 swords, 15 spears, 10 crossbows)
*	Keep everything for Haven's armory
*	Mixed approach
4.	March organization:
*	Who leads, who guards flanks, who brings up rear
*	How to organize 50 prisoners + 3 defectors + 10 team members
Tanis calls out: "Commander, we should move soon. Every minute here 
increases risk."
What are your final orders before departure?
Move out
Dec 7
OPERATION WESTGATE - 
EVACUATION
FINAL ORDERS
"Signal Haven. We're moving out in five minutes."
 
THE SIGNAL
Garrett fires three green flares into the sky.
The signal arcs high above the mountain pass, visible for miles.
Message to Haven's support teams: Mission success. Prisoners 
liberated. En route to Rally Point Alpha (first safe house).
 
MARCH ORGANIZATION
You organize the column efficiently:
 
VANGUARD (Advance scouts)
*	Tanis - ranging 200 yards ahead, watching for threats
LEAD ELEMENT
*	Johannes & Goldmoon - command presence, divine protection
*	Wagon #1 (Supply wagon) - food and medical supplies
*	5 strongest freed prisoners - walking alongside, helping navigate
MAIN BODY
*	33 able-bodied prisoners - organized into groups of 10-12
*	12 assisted prisoners - paired with helpers
*	Kessa - moving through column, keeping order, managing morale
*	Perin, Jorik, Matthis (defectors) - under Rickard's supervision, 
helping carry supplies
CENTER (Protected)
*	Prison wagon (now transport) - carrying 5 weakest prisoners
*	Wagon #2 (Weapons/armor) - Dragon Army equipment
*	Garrett, Finn, Cole - guarding valuable cargo
REAR GUARD
*	Rickard, Tomms, Olev - watching for pursuit
*	Screening force, ready to delay any followers
 
DEPARTURE
The column begins moving northwest.
Sixty-three people total:
*	50 freed prisoners
*	10 strike team members
*	3 Dragon Army defectors
Three wagons loaded with:
*	Food for weeks
*	Medical supplies
*	Weapons and armor (20 swords, 15 spears, 10 crossbows, ammunition)
*	150 gold in Dragon Army payroll
*	Intelligence documents
 
LEAVING THE KILL ZONE
Behind you:
*	10 Dragon Army corpses (Sergeant Krell, 4 veterans, 5 regulars)
*	Abandoned equipment
*	Blood-stained mountain pass
*	Evidence of total ambush victory
You don't burn or hide anything-let the Dragon Army find it. Let 
them fear what happened here.
 
THE MARCH - FIRST HOURS
Perception Check (Tanis - scouting ahead): 20 + 5 = 25
All clear. No patrols, no scouts, no pursuit yet.
The prisoners walk with purpose-exhausted but free. Some help 
each other. Some pray quietly. Some simply cry in relief.
Theron, the village elder, walks beside you:
"Thank you. I don't know who you are, where you came from, or how you 
knew we needed saving. But thank you."
He looks back at the column. "These people-we're from a dozen different 
villages. Taken over the past two weeks. Families torn apart, homes burned. 
We thought we'd die in Pax Tharkas mines."
"Now we're going to Haven. We're going to live. Because of you."
 
PROGRESS REPORT - 4 HOURS IN
Tanis returns from scouting:
"Four hours to first safe house. Pace is good-slower than combat march, but 
these people are doing better than expected. No pursuit visible."
Goldmoon's assessment:
"The five in the wagon are stable. I've been rotating healing among the 
weakest. Everyone's had water and food. We'll make it to the safe house 
without casualties."
Kessa's morale report:
"Spirits are high despite exhaustion. People are talking, sharing stories, 
making plans for Haven. The three defectors are working hard-Rickard has 
them carrying supplies, helping the elderly. They're trying to prove 
themselves."
 
ARRIVAL AT SAFE HOUSE - AFTER DARK
Eight hours after departure, you reach Rally Point Alpha.
A fortified farmstead in a valley, away from main roads. Haven's support team 
waited here with:
*	Hot food (stew, bread, fresh water)
*	Medical team (two healers)
*	Fresh supplies
*	Beds and blankets for 60+ people
*	Guard posts established
The Haven liaison-a middle-aged human woman named Serra-
greets you:
"Commander Constantinius. We received your signal. Fifty prisoners plus 
three defectors-incredible work." She surveys your column. "Everyone looks 
better than expected. Goldmoon's work, I assume?"
The cleric nods tiredly. "Mishakal's grace. And they're stronger than they 
look."
 
THAT EVENING - SAFE HOUSE
The freed prisoners eat hot food, receive medical care, rest in real 
beds for the first time in weeks.
Your strike team gathers for debrief:

GARRETT'S TOAST
That evening, around the fire:
"To Commander Constantinius and Kessa-who planned perfectly and 
executed flawlessly."
"To Goldmoon-whose healing kept everyone alive."
"To Tanis-who saw everything coming before it arrived."
"To the team-who trusted each other and worked as one."
"And to the fifty people sleeping safely tonight because we chose to fight."
Everyone raises cups. "To freedom!"
 
LAURANA'S MESSAGE (via Sending Stone - from 
Garrett)
Late that night, Garrett activates his sending stone. Laurana's voice comes 
through:
"Received signal. Fifty freed confirmed. Zero casualties remarkable. 
Intelligence valuable. Return when able. Full debriefing. Well done, all of 
you. Haven celebrates tonight. Brightblade out."
 
THE JOURNEY CONTINUES
Timeline:
*	Day 1: Ambush success, march to Safe House Alpha (complete)
*	Day 2-3: Continue northwest to Safe House Bravo
*	Day 4-5: Final push to Haven
*	Day 6: Arrival at Haven
You have 4-5 more days of escorting the freed prisoners home.
 
THAT NIGHT
Kessa finds you on watch:
"Flawless execution. Delegation worked perfectly-everyone knew their job, 
did it well, no confusion."
She sits beside you. "Fifty people freed. Three more converted to our cause. 
Verminaard's convoy obliterated. Intelligence on Pax Tharkas. And we didn't 
lose anyone."
"This is what the resistance looks like when it's working."
She pauses, looking at the safe house where freed prisoners sleep 
safely.
"And tomorrow we do it again. And again. Until there's no one left in chains."
 
READY TO CONTINUE?
Or do you want to:
1.	Timeskip to Haven arrival (Day 6)
2.	Play out the journey (potential encounters, character moments)
3.	Address something specific (the Disks, the defectors, planning next 
operations)
What's your preference?
Timeskip
Dec 7
RETURN TO HAVEN - DAY 6
THE ARRIVAL
Five days of steady marching bring the column to Haven's gates at midday.
Word has spread. The entire settlement has turned out.
 
THE WELCOME
As your column approaches, Haven's gates open wide.
Hundreds of people line the walls and streets-cheering, waving, calling out 
names of loved ones they thought lost.
Among the freed prisoners, recognition sparks:
*	A young woman screams "FATHER!" and breaks from the column, 
running toward an elderly man in the crowd
*	Two brothers find their mother waiting at the gate, all three collapsing 
into each other sobbing
*	Families reunite, lovers embrace, friends thought dead are found alive
It's chaos. Beautiful, joyful chaos.
 
LAURANA'S GREETING
Commander Brightblade stands at the gate, flanked by Captain Morna and 
Thoric Ironforge.
As you approach, she steps forward and salutes-crisp, military, respectful.
"Commander Constantinius. Welcome home."
She looks past you at the column: fifty freed prisoners, three wagons of 
supplies, zero casualties.
"Mission success doesn't begin to describe this. You've given Haven 
fifty new lives, vital supplies, and proof that coordinated resistance 
operations work."
She clasps your hand firmly. "Well done. All of you."
 
THE DEBRIEFING - LATER THAT AFTERNOON
Command Center. Full leadership present:
*	Laurana Brightblade (Commander)
*	Captain Morna (Defense)
*	Thoric Ironforge (Logistics)
*	Your strike team
*	New addition: Theron (freed prisoner elder, representing the rescued)
 
MISSION REPORT
Laurana reviews the results:
"Operational Success:
*	50 prisoners liberated (all alive, all arriving safely)
*	10 Dragon Army soldiers eliminated (including 1 sergeant, 4 veterans)
*	3 conscripts defected to our cause
*	Zero friendly casualties
*	Significant supply capture
Resources Acquired:
*	Food: 2 weeks for 100 people (extends our reserves significantly)
*	Weapons: 20 swords, 15 spears, 10 crossbows + ammunition
*	Gold: 150 pieces (operational funding)
*	Intelligence: Command structure, supply schedules, Pax Tharkas status
*	Morale: Immeasurable boost to Haven's population
Strategic Impact:
*	Dragon Army loses weekly convoy (disrupts Pax Tharkas supply chain)
*	Verminaard's forces realize convoys are vulnerable
*	Resistance demonstrates coordinated operation capability
*	Freed prisoners become residents, potential recruits, intelligence 
sources"
She looks at you. "This was textbook. Flawless planning, perfect 
execution, strategic thinking."
 
THE INTELLIGENCE - PAX THARKAS
Laurana spreads maps on the table:
"Your intelligence on Pax Tharkas is invaluable:
Current Status:
*	Commander Karthak Blacksteel (hobgoblin) in charge
*	~600 soldiers (reduced garrison)
*	~5 dark clerics of Takhisis
*	Verminaard and Ember absent (campaign in the north)
*	700+ prisoners in mines
*	Routine operations, not combat alert
Window of Opportunity:
*	Verminaard absent = weaker leadership, lower morale
*	No dragon = no aerial threat/terror weapon
*	Reduced garrison = fewer defenders
*	Spring weather = mountain passes opening, mobility improving
Challenges:
*	Still 600 trained soldiers vs. our ~350 fighters
*	Fortified position with defensive advantages
*	Dark clerics provide magical support
*	Blacksteel is competent, experienced commander
*	700 prisoners to evacuate under combat conditions
*	Supply lines for prolonged operation"
 
THORIC'S LOGISTICAL ASSESSMENT
The dwarf commander weighs in:
"If we're seriously considering Pax Tharkas liberation, here's what 
we need:
Military:
*	300+ combat-ready fighters (we have ~200 now, need +100)
*	Siege equipment or infiltration plan (can't storm walls directly)
*	Coordination with prisoners inside (internal uprising)
*	Multiple diversions (split defender attention)
*	Medical support for mass casualties
Logistics:
*	Supply caches along escape routes (700 people need food/water)
*	Transportation for wounded and weak prisoners
*	Safe houses to absorb 700+ refugees post-liberation
*	Weapons to arm freed prisoners who can fight
*	Weather window (avoid winter, avoid peak summer heat)
Timeline:
*	Minimum 2 months preparation (recruitment, training, supply 
gathering)
*	Ideal window: Late spring/early summer (next 2-3 months)
*	Before Verminaard returns to Pax Tharkas permanently
Estimate: Late spring, 2-3 months from now, is our window."
 
CAPTAIN MORNA'S STRATEGIC PROPOSAL
"Here's what I recommend:
Phase 1 (Next 2 months):
*	Continue hit-and-run operations (convoys, outposts, patrols)
*	Build combat experience for recruits
*	Gather intelligence on Pax Tharkas defenses
*	Establish contact with prisoner leadership inside
*	Stockpile supplies and equipment
Phase 2 (Month 3):
*	Finalize Pax Tharkas assault plan
*	Coordinate with allied resistance cells (if any)
*	Position forces and supplies
*	Execute operation when conditions optimal
Phase 3 (Post-liberation):
*	Mass evacuation of 700+ prisoners
*	Integrate them into resistance network
*	Prepare for Verminaard's inevitable retaliation
*	Use momentum to inspire wider rebellion"
She looks around the table. "This isn't just freeing prisoners. This is 
lighting the spark that could ignite regional resistance."
 
THERON'S PERSPECTIVE
The freed prisoner elder speaks:
"I was in Pax Tharkas for three weeks before this convoy. I know people 
inside-good people, strong people, people who would fight if given the 
chance."
"There's a man named Elistan-former cleric, lost his faith when the Dragon 
Army came. But he leads the prisoners, keeps them organized, keeps them 
alive. If you could contact him, coordinate with him..."
He leans forward. "700 prisoners armed and organized from inside while you 
attack from outside? That changes the math significantly."
 
LAURANA'S DECISION
"Here's what we're doing:
Immediate (Next 2 weeks):
*	Integrate the 50 freed prisoners into Haven (housing, food, medical 
care)
*	Debrief the 3 defectors (Perin, Jorik, Matthis) for detailed Dragon Army 
intel
*	Analyze captured correspondence for actionable intelligence
*	Rest and resupply strike teams
Short-term (Weeks 3-8):
*	Continue smaller operations (convoys, patrols, outposts)
*	Build combat experience and confidence
*	Recruit and train additional fighters (goal: 300+ combat-ready)
*	Gather specific intelligence on Pax Tharkas
*	Attempt contact with prisoner leadership (Elistan)
Long-term (Months 3-4):
*	Finalize Pax Tharkas liberation plan
*	Execute when conditions optimal
*	Change the war"
She stands. "This is ambitious. Dangerous. But possible. And your 
success at Westgate Pass proves we can execute complex 
operations."
 
RECOGNITION AND REWARDS
Laurana addresses your team specifically:
"Johannes, Kessa-you led this operation with tactical brilliance. 
Zero casualties, perfect execution, strategic success. Haven owes 
you a debt."
"Garrett and your crew-you've proven yourselves as capable 
fighters and leaders. I'm promoting you to strike team leadership. 
You'll train new teams using what you've learned."
"Tanis, Goldmoon-your skills were essential. Thank you for 
lending your expertise."
"Rickard, Tomms, Olev-solid work as always."
She turns to the three defectors standing nervously at the back: "Perin, 
Jorik, Matthis-you chose the right side. You'll be integrated into 
Haven's forces, your knowledge of Dragon Army will be invaluable. 
Welcome to the resistance."
 
THAT EVENING - CELEBRATION
Haven throws a feast.
The freed prisoners are the guests of honor. Food, ale, music, joy-rare 
commodities in these dark times, but tonight, Haven celebrates.
Families reunited. 
Lives saved. 
Hope renewed.
 
KESSA FINDS YOU
Away from the celebration, on Haven's walls:
"Big victory today. Fifty lives. Proof of concept. Path forward to Pax Tharkas."
She looks out at the valley. "We're building something real here, Johannes. 
Not just survival-actual resistance. Coordinated, strategic, effective."
A pause. "Goldmoon's watching you, you know. Waiting to see if you'll make a 
decision about the Disks. Laurana's watching too, though she doesn't know 
what she's watching for."
She doesn't push, just observes. "Whatever you decide, whenever you decide-
I'm with you. But eventually, you'll have to choose."
 
THE QUESTION
You've completed Operation Westgate. Fifty lives saved. Zero 
casualties. Perfect execution.
Haven is growing stronger. Pax Tharkas liberation is possible in 2-
3 months.
The Disks of Mishakal still rest in your Bag of Holding, waiting for 
your judgment.
What do you want to do?
1.	Address the Disks situation (make a decision about Laurana, 
Goldmoon, or wait longer)
2.	Plan next operations (what missions between now and Pax 
Tharkas?)
3.	Personal development (training, research, character growth)
4.	Timeskip to Pax Tharkas preparation (2-3 months)
5.	Something else
What's your priority?
I'm giving them to Goldmoon, but i want to RP that interaction.
Dec 7
THE DECISION
FINDING GOLDMOON
The celebration continues below, but you seek out the cleric. You find her in 
the temple, tending to the last of the freed prisoners' lingering ailments-
exhaustion, malnutrition, emotional trauma that healing magic can only 
partially address.
She looks up as you enter, reading something in your expression.
"Johannes." She sets down her staff. "You've made a decision."
It's not a question.
 
THE CONVERSATION
You gesture to the garden outside-the same place you spoke before the 
mission. Private. Quiet.
She follows without hesitation.
The evening air is cool, spring flowers blooming in the fading light. 
Haven's celebration echoes distantly.
You reach into your Bag of Holding and draw them out for the first time in her 
presence.
 
THE DISKS OF MISHAKAL
Two platinum disks, each the size of a dinner plate, inscribed with 
ancient runes that glow faintly blue.
The symbol of Mishakal-the healer, the protector, the goddess of mercy and 
compassion-etched into metal that seems to pulse with divine light.
Goldmoon's breath catches. She's seen representations, heard legends, 
but these-these are real. Ancient. Powerful.
"The true Disks," she whispers. "I thought they were lost. Destroyed 
in the Cataclysm or hidden so deep they'd never be found."
She doesn't reach for them. Doesn't presume. Just stares with reverence and 
wonder.
 
YOUR WORDS
What do you say to Goldmoon as you offer her the Disks?
This is your moment to explain:
*	Why her, specifically
*	What you hope she'll do with them
*	What this means for you
*	How Khisanth's trust led to this moment
*	Anything else you want to express
The cleric waits, listening with complete attention.
What does Johannes say?
She needs them because she has no need for them. Lausanne would use them 
in a good cause, but they would be a tool for her purpose. Goldmine would 
use them as Mishakal wants, not with an agenda of her own. She can tell 
Lauranna if she wants, that is up to her, or slow the Disks to lift the hearts of 
the Faithful on its own time and in its own ways.
Dec 7
THE GIFT
JOHANNES'S EXPLANATION
You hold the Disks carefully, meeting Goldmoon's eyes.
"I'm giving these to you. Not to Laurana, not to Haven's cause, not 
to the resistance. To you, Goldmoon."
You pause, organizing thoughts you've carried for months.
"Laurana would use them well-she's worthy, no question. She'd 
wield them to protect her people, to fight Verminaard, to build 
something meaningful. The Disks would become a tool for her 
purpose, and that purpose is good."
"But that's exactly why they shouldn't go to her."
You look down at the divine artifacts, their soft blue glow illuminating your 
hands.
"You need them because you have no need for them. You don't 
want them for a campaign, or a strategy, or to win battles. You 
serve Mishakal. You'll use them as she wants-not with an agenda 
of your own, but as an instrument of divine will."
"Laurana would use the Disks to serve her cause. You'll let the 
Disks serve their cause-healing, protecting, showing mercy. The 
difference matters."
 
THE TRUST
You extend them toward her.
"An ancient black dragon trusted me to find someone worthy. Not 
the most powerful person. Not the best tactician. Not even the most 
noble leader."
"Someone who would use them right. Who would let divine 
purpose guide their use rather than bending divine power to 
mortal purpose."
"That's you, Goldmoon. You're a cleric who channels Mishakal's 
will, not someone who uses Mishakal's power for their own plans-
even good plans."
 
THE FREEDOM
"What you do with them after this moment is entirely your choice. 
Tell Laurana if you want-she should know, she'll understand. Or 
don't tell her. Keep them private, let them work quietly."
"Use them in battle if that's what Mishakal guides you to do. Or use 
them to heal the sick, comfort the dying, protect refugees. Let them 
lift the hearts of the faithful in their own time, in their own ways."
"I'm not giving them to the resistance's cause. I'm giving them to 
Mishakal's servant. What that means, what that becomes-that's 
between you and your goddess."
 
THE WEIGHT LIFTED
You place the Disks in her hands.
"For months I've carried them. Protected them. Agonized over who 
deserved them. But the answer was simpler than I thought:"
"Not who deserves them. Who will serve them rather than being 
served by them."
"Khisanth trusted my judgment. I'm trusting yours."
 
GOLDMOON'S REACTION
She holds the Disks with trembling hands, tears streaming down her face.
The moment she touches them, they flare brilliantly-blue light 
exploding outward, warm and healing, filling the garden with 
radiance.
The light isn't blinding-it's welcoming. Like coming home. Like being 
embraced by something infinitely good and infinitely patient.
Goldmoon gasps, staggering slightly. You see her eyes go distant-
communing with something beyond mortal perception.
The light fades slowly, settling into a gentle glow around the Disks.
 
HER WORDS
When she speaks, her voice is thick with emotion:
"She's here. Mishakal. I feel her presence so clearly. The Disks 
are... they're not just artifacts. They're a connection. Direct, 
unfiltered divine grace."
She looks at you with wonder and gratitude.
**"You're right. These aren't tools for my purpose. They're conduits 
for her purpose. And she..." Goldmoon closes her eyes, listening to something 
you can't hear.
"She says you chose well. That you understood what the dragon 
meant. That your curse does not define you-your choices do. And 
your choice here was made with wisdom and selflessness."
She opens her eyes, looking at you with profound respect.
"Thank you, Johannes. For trusting me. For understanding the 
difference between using power and serving power."
 
THE PROMISE
Goldmoon cradles the Disks reverently.
"I will use these as Mishakal guides. I won't announce them-not 
yet. The faithful will feel their presence, draw strength from 
knowing divine power hasn't abandoned us. But I won't make them 
a spectacle or a weapon."
"When Mishakal wills them to be revealed, to be used openly-I'll 
know. Until then, they'll work quietly. Healing. Protecting. 
Reminding people that hope remains."
She steps forward and embraces you-brief, warm, sisterly.
"You carried a burden you didn't choose. Now you've passed it to 
someone who did choose. That's freedom, Johannes. For both of 
us."
 
THE LIGHTNESS
As you walk back toward the celebration, you feel it:
The weight is gone.
Not just the physical weight of the Disks (though your Bag of Holding is 
lighter). The burden of decision, of worthiness, of wondering if you'd choose 
correctly.
Khisanth's trust has been honored. 
The Disks are with someone who will serve them well. 
Your promise is fulfilled.
 
KESSA'S OBSERVATION
She finds you later, notices something different in your bearing.
"You gave them to Goldmoon." She says it with certainty, not asking.
When you nod, she grins. "Good choice. Laurana would've been good. 
But Goldmoon is right."
She bumps your shoulder companionably. "One less thing you're 
carrying. How does it feel?"
 
THE RING OF MIND SHIELDING
You still wear it-your mental protection remains. The patron can't read your 
thoughts, can't scry your location.
You're protected. The Disks are with someone worthy. The promise 
is kept.
 
FREEDOM AND PURPOSE
For the first time in months, you're not carrying divine artifacts or 
the weight of deciding their fate.
You're just Johannes Constantinius-warlock, resistance fighter, 
tactical commander-with a year before your next tribute payment 
and a war to fight.
 
WHAT NOW?
The Disks are given. Westgate Pass is won. Pax Tharkas looms 2-3 
months away.
What do you want to do?
1.	Rest and prepare (downtime before next operation)
2.	Plan intermediate missions (convoys, outposts, intelligence 
gathering)
3.	Research your curse (try to find ways to break the pact)
4.	Train and develop (improve capabilities before Pax Tharkas)
5.	Timeskip to Pax Tharkas preparation (2-3 months forward)
6.	Something else
Where does your story go from here?
Use Khisanths scale to inform her that the task is done, if she wants to 
communicate with you...
Dec 7
HONORING THE DRAGON
THE SCALE
You'd almost forgotten-tucked deep in your gear, wrapped carefully in cloth.
Khisanth's scale. Black as midnight, iridescent in certain light, warm to the 
touch despite being metallic. She gave it to you in Xak Tsaroth with specific 
instructions:
"If you need to contact me, or when the Disks find their rightful bearer, use 
this. Speak my name while holding it, and I will know."
 
FINDING PRIVACY
You wait until late that night, when Haven sleeps and the celebration has 
faded to embers.
You climb to the highest point of Haven's walls-alone, under stars, with the 
valley spread below in darkness.
You unwrap the scale carefully.
It feels heavier than it should, as if it carries more than just physical weight. 
The presence of an ancient creature's will, perhaps. Or simply your awareness 
of what it represents-a connection to something vast, old, and fundamentally 
alien to human understanding.
 
THE CONTACT
You hold the scale in both hands, speaking clearly into the night:
"Khisanth. Ancient of Xak Tsaroth. I invoke your attention."
The scale grows warm-not painfully hot, but noticeably, deliberately warm. 
Acknowledging.
"The task you gave me is complete. The Disks of Mishakal have 
found their rightful bearer. A cleric named Goldmoon who serves 
the goddess with pure devotion, who will use them as instruments 
of divine will rather than tools of mortal purpose."
"Your trust was not misplaced. Your judgment of my character was 
sound. The promise is kept."
You pause, then add honestly:
"Thank you for believing I could make this choice wisely. For 
trusting someone cursed and bound to darkness to carry 
something of light and healing. It... mattered."
 
THE RESPONSE
The scale flares hot for just a moment-almost painful-then settles back to 
warmth.
And then you hear her voice-not with your ears, but in your mind. Deep, 
resonant, ancient, carrying the weight of centuries:
 
KHISANTH'S WORDS
"Johannes Constantinius. Warlock of dubious pacts and 
considerable capability. You have honored our agreement."
There's something in her mental voice-not quite approval (dragons don't give 
approval lightly), but satisfaction. Recognition of competence.
"I knew you would choose well. Not because you are good-
goodness is unreliable, subject to mood and circumstance. But 
because you understand obligation. Because your word, once 
given, becomes binding in ways most mortals cannot 
comprehend."
"You gave your word to find a worthy bearer. You fulfilled that 
word not from righteousness, but from integrity. From the 
fundamental understanding that agreements matter, that trust 
must be honored, that chaos serves no one."
A pause-you can almost sense her amusement, dark and draconic.
"Ironic, is it not? A fiend-bound warlock teaching lessons of honor 
to a world that has largely forgotten what honor means. But 
dragons understand: alignment matters less than reliability. Your 
demon patron chose well when it bound you. And I chose well 
when I trusted you."
 
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
"The cleric you chose-Goldmoon, you called her-is indeed 
suitable. I have... observed, from distance. She will serve the Disks 
as they should be served. She will channel Mishakal's will without 
corruption or self-interest. Your judgment was sound."
"Our bargain is complete. You owe me nothing further. I owe you 
nothing further. We are balanced."
Then, unexpectedly:
"But understand this, warlock: You have proven yourself capable 
of wisdom despite your curse. Of making choices that serve greater 
purpose even when bound to darkness. That is rare. That 
is valuable."
"Should you ever find yourself in Xak Tsaroth's territory again-
should circumstances bring you to my domain 
with honest purpose-you will be received as one who has earned 
measured respect. Not friendship. Dragons do not befriend 
mortals. But acknowledgment. Recognition. A place at the 
negotiating table."
 
THE PARTING
"You walk a difficult path, Johannes Constantinius. Bound to a 
fiend, fighting against tyranny, seeking freedom from chains you 
forged in ignorance. I do not pity you-pity is weakness. But I 
recognize the struggle. I acknowledge the effort."
"May your curse break cleanly when the time comes. May your 
choices continue to define you more than your binding does. And 
may you find that freedom, when achieved, was worth the cost of 
earning it."
The warmth in the scale fades slowly.
"Go. Continue your war. Honor more agreements. Prove that 
morality is not about what you are, but what you choose to be."
"Our business is concluded."
The mental voice withdraws like tide receding from shore.
 
THE SILENCE AFTER
You stand alone on the wall, holding a now-cool dragon scale.
The connection is severed. The dragon has spoken. The 
acknowledgment is given.
 
WHAT IT MEANS
An ancient black dragon-inherently evil by nature-has declared 
you worthy of respect.
Not love. Not friendship. Not alliance.
But acknowledgment. Recognition that you keep your word, that you make 
wise choices, that you understand honor in ways many "good" people don't.
From a creature of law and darkness, that's perhaps the highest 
compliment possible.
 
THE SCALE'S FUTURE
The scale is now simply a scale-a memento, a reminder, a trophy of sorts.
You could:
*	Keep it as a reminder of the agreement honored
*	Mount it as decoration (symbol of achievement)
*	Save it for future emergency contact (unclear if it still functions)
*	Give it to someone (symbolic gift)
*	Something else
But its primary purpose is fulfilled. The dragon has been informed. 
The circle is closed.
 
KESSA'S VOICE
She's climbed up to the wall, found you standing alone.
"Talking to ancient dragons in the middle of the night?" She says it 
lightly, but there's genuine curiosity.
"Everything okay?"
 
THE MOMENT
You've fulfilled your promise to Khisanth. 
You've given the Disks to Goldmoon. 
You've successfully completed Operation Westgate. 
You've earned the measured respect of an ancient evil dragon.
You're free of several burdens you've carried for months.
What now?
Do you:
1.	Share the dragon conversation with Kessa
2.	Keep it private
3.	Discuss what comes next (Pax Tharkas, the resistance, your curse)
4.	Simply enjoy the moment of closure
What does Johannes do?
Actually, I was going to ask Khisanth if she would want to help with Pax 
Tharkas. If we can win there, it is too large a target to be left alone. 
Verminaard could never leave it alone. But if a black dragon were to assert 
claim, well, then an army would have to t take on an ancient black dragon in 
full power. We would do the liberating, she would just assist in the keeping. 
And serve as a means to keep Ember in check should the dragon decide to get 
involved?
I know I'm asking this before talking to Laurana and she won't like the 
spontaneous offer, by it is a valuable asset and makes strategic sense. We 
don't want to leave Haven and we would have to if we wanted to hold Pax 
Tharkas.
Dec 7
THE DRACONIC PROPOSITION
RECONSIDERING
Wait-before the connection fully fades, you feel the warmth in the scale 
flickering. Still there. Still active.
"Khisanth. One more matter. A proposal."
The warmth intensifies-attention returning, curious but wary.
"Speak, warlock. Quickly. My patience for extended negotiations is 
limited."
 
YOUR OFFER
You organize your thoughts, speaking with the same directness she 
appreciates:
"Pax Tharkas. The fortress in the mountain pass. Currently held by 
Dragon Highlord Verminaard and his red dragon Ember. 
Approximately 700 prisoners enslaved there for mining 
operations."
"The resistance plans to liberate it within 2-3 months-while 
Verminaard and Ember are campaigning elsewhere. We free the 
prisoners, we destroy Dragon Army control."
"But here's the strategic problem: The fortress is too valuable to 
abandon. Too strategically positioned. Verminaard will return with 
armies to retake it. We can't hold it-Haven lacks the numbers, and 
holding Pax Tharkas would expose our main base."
You pause, then deliver the proposition:
"What if an ancient black dragon asserted territorial claim 
instead?"
 
THE LOGIC
"We do the liberating-free the prisoners, clear out Dragon Army 
forces, eliminate their infrastructure. That's our work, our risk, 
our purpose."
"But when Verminaard returns and finds it empty? He finds it 
claimed by Khisanth of Xak Tsaroth. An ancient black dragon in 
full power, asserting rightful territorial dominance over a 
strategically valuable mountain fortress."
"Verminaard would face a choice: Send armies against an ancient 
dragon to reclaim a fortress-costly, risky, potentially losing both 
armies AND Ember if she engages you. Or... accept the territorial 
claim, redirect resources elsewhere, avoid a dragon war he can't 
guarantee winning."
"You gain Pax Tharkas-prime real estate, mountain stronghold, 
mining resources, strategic position. We gain freedom for 700 
prisoners and Verminaard permanently denied a key asset."
"And if Ember decides to contest your claim? You're ancient, 
experienced, defending fortified position. She's younger, 
aggressive, but not stupid. Dragons don't fight territorial wars 
lightly."
 
THE MUTUAL BENEFIT
"You get:
*	Pax Tharkas fortress (valuable territory)
*	Mining operations (economic resources)
*	Strategic position (control of mountain pass)
*	Minimal effort (we do the hard work of liberation)
*	Strengthened territorial claim (demonstrating power projection)
We get:
*	700 prisoners freed
*	Verminaard denied a major stronghold permanently
*	No need to garrison or defend it ourselves
*	Dragon deterrent against Verminaard's retaliation
*	Ember potentially checked by your presence
Verminaard loses:
*	Key fortress
*	700 slave laborers
*	Strategic position
*	Resources to fight a dragon war he can't afford while campaigning 
elsewhere"
 
THE HONESTY
"I'm making this offer without consulting resistance leadership 
first. That's tactically questionable, admittedly. But Commander 
Brightblade will understand the strategic value even if she dislikes 
the spontaneity."
"And you respect directness. You respect bold proposals made with 
clear mutual benefit. So I'm proposing now, while we're in contact, 
rather than going through diplomatic channels that would waste 
your time."
"This is pragmatism. This is law triumphing over chaos. This is two 
parties with aligned interests making an agreement that serves 
both."
A pause.
"Interested?"
 
THE LONG SILENCE
The warmth in the scale fluctuates-not fading, but... processing. Considering.
You can almost feel the ancient mind working through implications, 
calculating advantages, weighing risks.
Finally:
 
KHISANTH'S RESPONSE
"Bold. Audacious. Strategically sound. And precisely the kind of 
proposal that demonstrates why I judged you capable."
There's something in her mental voice-not quite laughter, but dark 
amusement.
"You propose I become territorial claimant to a fortress currently 
held by a Dragon Highlord and a red dragon. You offer me a war 
with Verminaard, wrapped in the language of 'mutual benefit' and 
'strategic opportunity.'"
"And yet... you are not wrong."
 
HER ANALYSIS
"Pax Tharkas is indeed valuable. Mountain stronghold, strategic 
pass, economic resources. I have never claimed it because 
Verminaard's presence made it... inconvenient. Too much effort 
for uncertain gain."
"But if you eliminate Dragon Army forces, free the prisoners, leave 
the fortress empty? Then my claim becomes fait accompli. 
Possession through opportunity rather than conquest."
"Verminaard returns to find not an enemy force to fight, but a 
territorial dragon to negotiate with. Blacks are lawful. We honor 
agreements, respect borders, engage in diplomacy. Reds are 
chaotic-aggressive, passionate, unreliable."
"He might actually prefer dealing with me over dealing with 
continued resistance occupation. I'm predictable. I can be 
bargained with. I don't care about his tyranny-only about my 
territory."
A pause-considering more.
 
THE CONDITIONS
"Here is my counteroffer, warlock:"
"I will support your liberation of Pax Tharkas-but not through 
direct combat. I am not your army. I am not your weapon. I do not 
fight your battles."
"What I offer instead:"
1. Territorial Claim: "The moment your forces control the fortress and 
evacuate prisoners, I arrive and assert formal territorial dominance. I occupy 
Pax Tharkas openly, visibly, undeniably."
2. Diplomatic Shield: "When Verminaard returns, he negotiates with me-
an ancient dragon with legitimate territorial claim-rather than chasing 
scattered resistance forces. I become the problem he must solve, not you."
3. Ember Deterrent: "If Ember attempts to reclaim Pax Tharkas by force, 
she faces me in fortified position with territorial right. That's a fight she 
cannot win. Even red arrogance has limits. Her pride might compel challenge, 
but Verminaard's pragmatism will likely restrain her."
4. Intelligence Sharing: "I will inform you of any Dragon Army movements 
toward my new territory-they threaten you as much as me. Limited 
cooperation, mutual benefit."
 
THE PRICE
"What I require in return:"
"First: The fortress must be substantially intact. I will not claim 
ruins. Your liberation must preserve structure, defenses, value. 
Destroy the Dragon Army-not the fortress."
"Second: Complete prisoner evacuation. I will not tolerate slaves in 
my territory. Free them all, remove them all. I claim land and 
stone, not people."
"Third: Mining operations cease. The resources are mine to exploit 
or ignore as I choose. You gain no economic benefit beyond the 
liberation itself."
"Fourth: Formal acknowledgment. Your resistance leadership 
recognizes my territorial claim. I am not ally-I am neutral 
sovereign power claiming rightful domain. No future attempts to 
'liberate' my fortress."
 
THE WARNING
"Understand the risks, warlock:"
"If your liberation fails-if Verminaard returns before you've 
cleared the fortress, if prisoners remain inside, if your forces are 
trapped when Dragon Army reinforcements arrive-I do not 
intervene. You bear the consequences of tactical failure."
"If Ember attacks before you've evacuated, I do not defend your 
retreat. I defend my claimed territory only after it becomes my 
territory."
"If Verminaard decides to pay the cost of a dragon war despite 
strategic irrationality, I fight for myself-not for you. Our interests 
align only insofar as Pax Tharkas remains mine."
 
THE OFFER
"But if you succeed? If you free 700 prisoners, deny Verminaard a 
key fortress, and hand me prime territorial claim with minimal 
effort on my part?"
"Then yes. I accept this proposition."
"Pax Tharkas becomes mine. Verminaard's problem becomes 
negotiating with an ancient dragon rather than chasing resistance 
forces. Ember faces a peer competitor who holds advantageous 
position."
"And you, Johannes Constantinius, will have orchestrated a victory 
that costs your resistance nothing except the battle itself-while 
permanently denying your enemy a strategic asset."
 
THE CONFIRMATION
"Do these terms satisfy your strategic vision? Or will you return 
with counterproposals after consulting your commander who will, 
as you said, dislike your spontaneity?"
There's definite amusement now.
"I suspect she will accept despite her displeasure. The mathematics 
are too compelling. But I am curious whether you possess 
authority to agree on her behalf-or if you must negotiate twice: 
once with me, once with your own leadership."
 
YOUR DECISION
Khisanth has made a counteroffer:
She provides:
*	Territorial claim (immediate after liberation)
*	Diplomatic shield (becomes Verminaard's problem)
*	Ember deterrent (peer dragon in fortified position)
*	Intelligence sharing (limited cooperation)
She requires:
*	Fortress substantially intact
*	All prisoners evacuated
*	Mining operations cease (resources are hers)
*	Formal recognition of territorial claim
She will NOT:
*	Fight during the liberation
*	Defend retreat if operation fails
*	Act as ally beyond territorial self-interest
 
Do you:
1.	Accept on behalf of the resistance (trust Laurana will agree)
2.	Negotiate modifications (change terms before accepting)
3.	Request time to consult (bring to Laurana first)
4.	Decline the counteroffer (too risky/not enough benefit)
What's your call, Commander?
I agree on my own behalf, but a you say, my integrity demands honoring my 
obligations. I have accepted Lauren's leadership; i cannot bargain in her behalf 
without her permission to do so. Therefore, accept this agreement on my 
honor with the understanding that should Lauranna not agree, you are free 
from any bargain?
Dec 7
THE BINDING AGREEMENT
YOUR RESPONSE
You speak carefully, precisely-the language of oaths and obligations that 
dragons understand:
"Khisanth of Xak Tsaroth. I accept your terms on my own behalf, 
with full understanding and intent to fulfill them."
"However, my integrity demands honoring my obligations. I have 
accepted Commander Brightblade's leadership. I cannot bargain 
on her behalf without her permission to do so."
"Therefore: I accept this agreement on my honor, with the explicit 
understanding that should Commander Brightblade refuse to ratify 
these terms, you are released from any bargain. No obligation 
remains. No dishonor accrues to either party."
"I believe she will accept-the strategic mathematics are too 
compelling. But if she does not, you are free. The agreement 
becomes void, as if never made."
You pause, then add:
"This is proper. This is lawful. This honors both your sovereignty 
and my commander's authority. An agreement made in good faith, 
conditional on appropriate authorization."
 
KHISANTH'S SATISFACTION
The warmth in the scale pulses-approval, genuine and unmistakable.
"Perfect. Absolutely perfect."
There's something like respect in her mental voice now.
"You understand the architecture of obligation. You recognize that 
personal honor cannot override legitimate authority. You structure 
agreements with precision and acknowledge limitations honestly."
"This is why I chose correctly when I trusted you with the Disks. 
This is why you will succeed where others-more powerful, more 
'good'-would fail."
"Because you comprehend that law is not rigidity. Law is structure. 
Framework. The bones upon which functional society is built. And 
you navigate that framework with clarity and honesty."
 
THE CONDITIONAL AGREEMENT
"Very well. Our agreement stands as follows:"
**"Johannes Constantinius binds himself on his personal honor to:"
*	Liberate Pax Tharkas (fortress substantially intact)
*	Evacuate all prisoners (complete removal)
*	Cede territorial claim to Khisanth (no resistance occupation)
*	Recognize draconic sovereignty (neutral power, not ally)
**"Khisanth of Xak Tsaroth binds herself to:"
*	Assert territorial claim (upon successful liberation)
*	Serve as diplomatic shield (Verminaard's problem)
*	Deter Ember (peer dragon in fortified position)
*	Share relevant intelligence (limited cooperation)
**"Conditional upon:"
*	Commander Laurana Brightblade's ratification (within reasonable 
timeframe)
*	If refused, agreement becomes void (no dishonor, no obligation)
"Time limit for ratification: One month. Sufficient for you to 
present terms, debate merits, secure approval or denial. After one 
month without confirmation, I consider agreement declined and 
move forward with other territorial interests."
 
THE SEAL
"This bargain is witnessed by the laws of dragonkind and the honor 
of those who make oaths knowing their weight."
The scale flares HOT-searing for just an instant, then cool.
"Marked. Recorded. Binding upon both parties pending 
ratification."
 
THE PARTING - SECOND ATTEMPT
"Now, warlock, I truly depart. You have honored one agreement 
and proposed another with proper structure and understanding. 
That is sufficient business for one night."
"Present this to your commander. She will be displeased by your 
initiative, I suspect. But she will accept because she is strategic, not 
merely emotional."
"And when Pax Tharkas falls to your forces, when prisoners walk 
free and fortress stands empty-send word via the scale. I will 
come. I will claim. And Verminaard will learn that even Dragon 
Highlords must respect territorial law."
A final pulse of warmth.
"Fight well, Johannes Constantinius. Honor your obligations. 
Break your curse when you can. And remember: evil is a 
description of nature, not a judgment of worth. Law matters more 
than alignment. Actions matter more than origins."
"Farewell."
The connection severs cleanly. The scale goes cold and inert.
 
THE SILENCE
You stand alone on Haven's wall, holding a dragon scale that has just 
witnessed a conditional agreement between a cursed warlock and an ancient 
black dragon.
You've committed yourself personally to terms you believe Laurana 
will accept.
You've structured it properly-honorable, conditional, respecting 
authority.
But you've also just made a unilateral diplomatic overture to an evil 
dragon without consulting resistance leadership first.
 
KESSA'S VOICE - STILL WAITING
She's been standing nearby, watching you talk to apparently empty air while 
holding a glowing scale.
"So... how did the dragon take the news about the Disks?"
She pauses, reading your expression.
"And what the hell else did you just agree to?"
 
THE MOMENT OF TRUTH
You need to:
1.	Explain to Kessa what just happened
2.	Prepare to present this to Laurana (who will NOT be happy about 
spontaneous dragon diplomacy)
3.	Make the case for why this is strategically sound
4.	Accept responsibility for making the offer without authorization
How do you want to handle this?
Do you:
*	Tell Kessa everything now
*	Wait and present to Laurana first
*	Something else
And what's your approach for presenting this to Laurana?
(This is going to be an interesting conversation...)
Tell less ectopic, then go find Lauranna, things just got clearer, if not a lot 
more complicated.
Dec 7
THE EXPLANATION
TELLING KESSA
You turn to her, still holding the now-cold scale.
"The dragon conversation went well beyond just informing her 
about the Disks."
Kessa's eyebrows rise. "Oh?"
"I proposed an alliance. Conditional. For Pax Tharkas."
"You what."
"I offered Khisanth territorial claim to the fortress after we 
liberate it. She becomes the occupying power, not us. Verminaard's 
problem becomes negotiating with an ancient dragon instead of 
chasing resistance forces. Ember gets deterred by peer competition 
in fortified position."
Kessa stares at you for a long moment.
"That's... actually brilliant strategically. We can't hold Pax Tharkas 
ourselves-it would expose Haven and tie down our entire force. 
But a dragon claiming it as territory?" She processes 
rapidly. "Verminaard can't ignore it, can't easily retake it, and we 
walk away having freed 700 people without the burden of 
occupation."
Then her expression shifts. "Laurana is going to kill you for negotiating 
with ancient evil dragons without authorization."
"I structured it conditionally. She has to ratify it. If she refuses, the 
agreement is void-no dishonor to either party."
Kessa laughs despite herself. "You made a conditional diplomatic 
agreement with a black dragon based on your personal honor while 
explicitly acknowledging you lack authority to bind the resistance."
"Yes."
"That's either the smartest thing you've ever done or the most 
diplomatically catastrophic." She grins. "Probably both. Come on. 
Let's go wake up Laurana and find out which."
 
FINDING LAURANA
It's past midnight, but you find her still awake in the command center, 
reviewing intelligence reports by lamplight.
She looks up as you enter, immediately reading urgency in your bearing.
"Johannes. Kessa. It's late for a social call." Her tone is wary. "What's 
happened?"
 
YOUR PRESENTATION
How do you explain to Laurana that you just:
1.	Contacted an ancient black dragon
2.	Proposed territorial agreement for Pax Tharkas
3.	Made conditional commitment on your personal honor
4.	Did all this without consulting her first
Do you lead with:
*	The strategic benefits (emphasize why it's smart)
*	The apology (acknowledge overstepping authority)
*	The conditions (stress it requires her approval)
*	The timeline (one month to decide)
*	Something else
What's your approach?
Tell her everything, leading with the conditions and the honor and law 
underlying the proposal.
Dec 7
THE MIDNIGHT BRIEFING
LAYING IT OUT
You sit across from Laurana, meeting her eyes directly.
"Commander, I've just made a conditional diplomatic proposal to 
an ancient black dragon regarding Pax Tharkas. It requires your 
ratification within one month, or it becomes void with no dishonor 
to either party."
Her expression freezes. "You did what."
"Let me explain the structure first, then the substance."
You speak precisely, the language of oaths and obligations:
 
THE FRAMEWORK
"I contacted Khisanth of Xak Tsaroth-the ancient black dragon 
who gave me the Disks of Mishakal-to inform her that task was 
complete. During that conversation, I proposed an agreement 
regarding our planned liberation of Pax Tharkas."
"I bound myself on my personal honor to specific terms. However, 
I explicitly structured the agreement as conditional upon your 
ratification, acknowledging that I lack authority to commit the 
resistance without your approval."
"The dragon accepted this structure. She understands law, respects 
proper authority, and recognizes that personal honor cannot 
override legitimate command hierarchy."
"If you refuse to ratify within one month, the agreement becomes 
void. No obligation remains on either side. No dishonor accrues. 
It's as if the proposal was never made."
Laurana's hands are flat on the table, her expression 
unreadable. "Continue."
 
THE SUBSTANCE
"The proposal addresses our fundamental strategic problem with 
Pax Tharkas:"
"We can liberate it-free 700 prisoners, eliminate Dragon Army 
presence. But we cannot hold it. Occupying the fortress would 
require most of our fighters, expose Haven's location, and make us 
a static target for Verminaard's retaliation."
"If we abandon it after liberation, Verminaard simply reoccupies 
and we've gained nothing permanent except freed prisoners."
"The dragon offers a third option: territorial claim."
 
THE TERMS - WHAT KHISANTH PROVIDES
"Upon successful liberation, Khisanth asserts formal territorial 
dominance over Pax Tharkas. She becomes the occupying power-
an ancient black dragon claiming rightful sovereignty over 
strategically valuable territory."
"This provides us:
1. Diplomatic Shield: "Verminaard's problem becomes negotiating with a 
territorial dragon, not chasing resistance forces. We disappear. She becomes 
his obstacle."
2. Ember Deterrent: "If Ember attempts to reclaim the fortress, she faces a 
peer ancient dragon in fortified position. That's a fight she cannot guarantee 
winning. Even red arrogance has limits when facing defensive advantage."
3. Permanent Denial: "Verminaard loses Pax Tharkas permanently-not to 
resistance he can crush, but to a sovereign dragon he must treat with 
diplomatically or fight at great cost."
4. Intelligence Sharing: "Limited cooperation. She informs us of Dragon 
Army movements toward her territory, as they threaten both her claim and 
our operations."
5. No Occupation Burden: "We free 700 people without the responsibility 
of holding territory we cannot defend."
 
THE TERMS - WHAT KHISANTH REQUIRES
"In exchange:
1. Fortress Substantially Intact: "We destroy Dragon Army forces, not the 
fortress itself. She claims valuable territory, not ruins."
2. Complete Prisoner Evacuation: "All 700 prisoners removed. She will 
not tolerate slaves in her territory-she wants land and stone, not people."
3. Mining Ceases: "The resources become hers to exploit or ignore. We gain 
no economic benefit beyond the liberation."
4. Formal Recognition: "We acknowledge her territorial sovereignty. She is 
neutral power, not ally. We make no future attempts to 'liberate' her fortress."
 
THE LIMITATIONS - WHAT KHISANTH WILL 
NOT DO
"She is clear about what she does NOT provide:
"She will not fight during our liberation. She's not our army or 
weapon. She claims the fortress only after we've successfully 
cleared it and evacuated prisoners."
"If our liberation fails-if Verminaard returns before we're done, if 
we're trapped, if the operation goes wrong-she does not intervene. 
We bear the full risk of tactical failure."
"If Ember attacks before evacuation is complete, she doesn't 
defend our retreat. She defends only her claimed territory, only 
after it becomes hers."
"She fights for herself, not for us. Our interests align only insofar 
as Pax Tharkas remains hers."
 
THE STRATEGIC LOGIC
"Commander, the mathematics are compelling:
Without this agreement:
*	We free 700 prisoners (good)
*	We cannot hold Pax Tharkas (strategic problem)
*	Verminaard reoccupies within weeks (temporary victory)
*	We've gained freed people but no territorial denial
With this agreement:
*	We free 700 prisoners (same good)
*	Dragon claims territory (no burden on us)
*	Verminaard faces dragon negotiation or dragon war (permanent denial)
*	We achieve liberation without occupation cost
The cost to us:
*	Acknowledging dragon's sovereignty (easy-she's not our enemy)
*	Keeping fortress intact (we wanted that anyway for prisoner safety)
*	Giving up economic exploitation (we couldn't hold it for that anyway)
*	Accepting we don't control Pax Tharkas post-liberation (we couldn't 
anyway)
What we gain:
*	700 freed prisoners
*	Permanent denial of key enemy asset
*	Ember deterred by peer competitor
*	Verminaard's resources diverted to dragon diplomacy/war
*	Haven remains hidden and secure
*	No occupation burden"
 
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
You lean back, meeting her eyes directly.
"I made this proposal without consulting you first. That was 
tactically questionable and I acknowledge it."
"But I had an open channel to an ancient dragon who respects 
directness and decisive action. Dragons don't wait for committee 
deliberations. They negotiate in the moment or not at all."
"So I structured it to protect your authority: conditional 
agreement, explicit requirement for your ratification, one-month 
timeline for decision, void if you refuse."
"I bound my personal honor because that's what dragons 
understand and respect. But I explicitly stated I cannot commit the 
resistance without your approval."
"The decision is yours, Commander. Accept and gain permanent 
territorial denial of Pax Tharkas at no occupation cost. Refuse and 
we proceed with original liberation plans, accepting that we cannot 
hold what we free."
You spread your hands. "I believe the strategic value justifies the 
diplomatic irregularity. But I serve under your command. The 
choice is yours."
 
LAURANA'S REACTION
She's been silent throughout, listening with absolute focus.
Now she stands, paces to the map table, studies Pax Tharkas's position.
Long silence.
Finally, she turns back.
"You negotiated with an ancient evil dragon. Without 
authorization. Based on personal honor and conditional terms."
Her voice is carefully controlled.
"And you're right. Strategically, it's brilliant."
She returns to the table, sits heavily.
"We've been wrestling with exactly this problem-how to liberate 
without the burden of holding. Every scenario ended with either 
abandoning Pax Tharkas back to Verminaard or tying down our 
entire force in static defense."
"A dragon claiming territorial sovereignty solves that completely. 
She becomes Verminaard's problem. We walk away clean."
She looks at you, expression complex-frustration, respect, calculation.
"I should be furious with you for this diplomatic initiative. Chain of 
command exists for reasons."
A pause.
"But you structured it properly. You acknowledged your limits. 
You made it conditional. And most importantly..." She taps the 
map. "You found a solution to an unsolvable problem."
 
HER QUESTIONS
"Before I decide, I need clarifications:"
"One: Can we trust her? She's lawful evil-will she honor the 
agreement, or is this a trap?"
"Two: What stops her from claiming the fortress with prisoners 
still inside, trapping them under dragon rule instead of Dragon 
Army rule?"
"Three: If Verminaard decides to pay the cost of dragon war 
anyway, does that endanger Haven by association?"
"Four: What does Captain Morna think? Thoric? Goldmoon? This 
affects the entire resistance, not just our tactical plans."
"Five: One month timeline-is that enough to plan the liberation 
operation properly, or are we being rushed?"
 
How do you answer her questions?
Innit the Disks, that's goldmines story to reveal.
Dec 7
ANSWERING LAURANA'S 
QUESTIONS
YOUR RESPONSES
You address each concern methodically:
 
QUESTION ONE: TRUST
"Can we trust her? Yes-within the bounds of what we're actually 
asking."
"Khisanth is lawful evil. That 'lawful' part is critical. She honors 
agreements, respects territorial law, understands that reputation 
matters. Breaking oaths damages her standing among dragonkind 
and makes future negotiations impossible."
"She's not asking us to trust her altruism or goodness-we're 
trusting her self-interest. Pax Tharkas is valuable territory. She 
wants it. We're offering it to her with minimal effort on her part. 
Why would she sabotage an arrangement that benefits her 
directly?"
"The agreement is structured around mutual benefit, not morality. 
That's exactly the kind of bargain lawful evil creatures honor-
because breaking it costs them more than keeping it."
"I've dealt with her before, in Xak Tsaroth. She negotiated fairly, 
kept her word, and we both walked away satisfied. She's reliable 
precisely because she's lawful."
 
QUESTION TWO: PRISONER PROTECTION
"What stops her claiming the fortress with prisoners inside?"
"The agreement explicitly requires complete prisoner evacuation 
before her claim activates. That's a hard condition-non-
negotiable, stated clearly in our terms."
"More importantly, she doesn't want slaves in her territory. She 
said it directly: 'I will not tolerate slaves in my territory. Free them 
all, remove them all. I claim land and stone, not people.'"
"Why? Because governing enslaved populations is complicated, 
messy, requires infrastructure she doesn't want to build. She wants 
valuable, defensible territory-not administrative headaches."
"Dragons are territorial sovereigns, not slavers. She gains nothing 
from prisoners and loses nothing from their liberation."
"If we fail to evacuate before she arrives, she won't claim-the 
conditions aren't met, the agreement is void. She has no incentive 
to break terms that work perfectly in her favor when followed."
 
QUESTION THREE: HAVEN'S SAFETY
"If Verminaard fights her anyway, does Haven face danger by 
association?"
"No-that's the brilliance of this structure."
"We liberate the fortress. We evacuate prisoners. We leave. When 
Khisanth arrives and claims territory, we're already gone-back to 
Haven, absorbed into our hidden base, untraceable."
"Verminaard returns to find a dragon claiming sovereignty. He 
doesn't know who freed the prisoners. He doesn't know where they 
went. He only knows an ancient black dragon now occupies his 
fortress and demands recognition as territorial sovereign."
"If he chooses dragon war, that's between him and Khisanth. We're 
not parties to their conflict. We're not allied with her-she's 
explicitly neutral power, not resistance ally."
"The only connection is the liberation itself-which we'd do 
regardless. Her claiming the fortress afterward doesn't tie us to her 
any more than freeing prisoners ties us to whoever they settle 
near."
"Haven remains hidden. We maintain operational security. The 
dragon deal is separate from resistance identity."
 
QUESTION FOUR: COMMAND COUNSEL
"What do the other leaders think?"
"I came to you first, Commander. You have authority to convene 
command council and present this for debate."
"Captain Morna will assess tactical implications. Thoric will 
calculate logistical costs versus benefits. Others will weigh strategic 
value."
"But there's one person whose counsel matters particularly: 
Goldmoon."
You pause deliberately. "She has... perspective on dealing with 
powerful entities and understanding when pragmatic alliances 
serve higher purposes, even with those whose nature differs from 
ours."
"I recommend consulting her specifically. Not because she has 
military expertise, but because she understands the difference 
between alliance and arrangement, between moral compromise 
and strategic necessity."
You don't reveal the Disks-that's Goldmoon's story to tell when and how she 
chooses. But you signal clearly that her spiritual wisdom is relevant here.
 
QUESTION FIVE: TIMELINE
"One month-is that enough time?"
"More than enough. We were already planning Pax Tharkas 
liberation for 2-3 months out-late spring/early summer window 
while Verminaard is absent."
"This doesn't rush that timeline. The one-month deadline is for 
your decision to ratify or refuse the agreement-not for executing 
the operation."
"If you ratify now, we still have 2-3 months to plan, prepare, 
recruit, gather intelligence, coordinate with prisoner leadership 
inside, position supplies along escape routes-everything we'd do 
anyway."
"The dragon doesn't require immediate action. She requires 
confirmation that when we DO liberate Pax Tharkas-on our 
timeline, when we're ready-she'll be the one to claim it 
afterward."
"If anything, having this settled early gives us more clarity for 
planning. We know we don't need to prepare for occupation. We 
can focus entirely on liberation and evacuation-simplifying our 
operational requirements significantly."
 
YOUR CONCLUSION
"Commander, I don't ask you to decide tonight. Convene command 
council. Consult Captain Morna, Thoric, Goldmoon, others whose 
wisdom you trust."
"Debate the merits. Challenge the assumptions. Identify risks I 
haven't considered."
"But understand: this solves our core strategic problem. We gain 
everything we wanted from Pax Tharkas liberation-700 freed 
prisoners, permanent denial of enemy asset, strategic victory-
without the impossible burden of long-term occupation."
"And we have a month to decide. No rush. No pressure. Just careful 
consideration of whether the strategic mathematics justify the 
diplomatic irregularity."
You meet her eyes. "I believe they do. But I serve your command. The 
decision is yours."
 
LAURANA'S RESPONSE
She's silent again, processing.
Finally: "I'll convene command council tomorrow morning. Full 
briefing, open debate. We decide as leadership, not as individuals."
"But Johannes?" She looks at you seriously. "If we ratify this, if we 
agree to your dragon arrangement-you own it. If it goes wrong, if 
she betrays terms, if there are consequences we didn't foresee-
that's on you."
"Not as punishment. As responsibility. You negotiated it. You'll 
answer for it."
A pause, then something almost like a smile.
"But if it works? If we free 700 people and permanently deny 
Verminaard a fortress through dragon diplomacy no one else 
would have thought to attempt?"
"Then you'll have proven that sometimes the most unexpected 
solutions are the right ones."
She stands. "Get some rest. Tomorrow we debate whether the 
resistance makes deals with ancient evil dragons."
 
DISMISSED
Kessa waits outside.
"How'd it go?"
What do you tell her?
Everything, then go to bed, it's been a very long night
Dec 7
THE AFTERMATH
DEBRIEFING KESSA
You walk together through Haven's quiet streets, everyone else asleep.
"She's convening command council tomorrow morning. Full 
briefing, open debate. She'll present it to Captain Morna, Thoric, 
Goldmoon, and the other leaders."
"And?" Kessa prompts.
"She understands the strategic value. Called it brilliant, actually. 
But she's rightfully concerned about trust, prisoner safety, Haven's 
exposure, and whether we're being rushed."
"I answered what I could. Emphasized that Khisanth is lawful evil-
reliable because of self-interest and reputation, not morality. That 
the agreement protects prisoners through hard conditions. That 
Haven remains hidden regardless. That we have plenty of time to 
plan."
Kessa nods slowly. "She's going to approve it. The math is too good. 
But she needed to make sure you'd thought it through-and that 
you'd take responsibility if it goes sideways."
"Which I will."
"I know." She bumps your shoulder. "You made a deal with a dragon 
based on personal honor to solve an impossible strategic problem. 
That's either going to be legendary or catastrophic."
A slight grin. "Probably both."
 
REACHING YOUR QUARTERS
The small room Haven provided-simple, clean, safe. A real bed, not a bedroll 
on stone or dirt.
"Get some sleep," Kessa says from the doorway. "Tomorrow you get to 
explain dragon diplomacy to a room full of military commanders 
who are going to have opinions."
"Can't wait."
She laughs. "For what it's worth? I think you did the right thing. 
Spontaneous, unauthorized, diplomatically irregular-but right. 
Sometimes the best solutions come from people willing to make 
bold moves without waiting for permission."
"Just don't make it a habit. Laurana's patience has limits."
She heads to her own quarters, leaving you alone with your thoughts.
 
THE WEIGHT OF THE DAY
You sit on the bed, finally processing everything that's happened:
This morning: Arrived at Haven with 50 freed prisoners, zero casualties, 
perfect operation
This afternoon: Debriefing, celebration, recognition from leadership
This evening: Made the decision about the Disks, gave them to Goldmoon
Tonight: Contacted Khisanth, informed her of task completion, proposed 
dragon diplomacy for Pax Tharkas, made conditional agreement on personal 
honor, briefed Laurana
Tomorrow: Defend the proposal to command council
 
THE CHANGES
Burdens lifted:
*	The Disks are with someone worthy (Goldmoon)
*	Khisanth's task is complete (promise fulfilled)
*	The dragon respects you (measured acknowledgment)
New responsibilities:
*	Dragon agreement (conditional, pending ratification)
*	Personal accountability (you own the consequences)
*	Command council tomorrow (defend the proposal)
Strategic position:
*	Pax Tharkas solution (potentially solved)
*	700 prisoners (liberation planned)
*	Haven's growth (resistance strengthening)
 
SLEEP
You lie down, exhausted but satisfied.
The Ring of Mind Shielding protects your thoughts. 
The Amulet of Health strengthens your body. 
Your patron is silent, distant, unaware of your machinations.
You have nearly a year before next tribute payment. 
You have a resistance to lead. 
You have a war to fight. 
You have a curse to eventually break.
But tonight, you sleep.
 
MORNING - COMMAND COUNCIL
Dawn breaks over Haven.
You wake to find a messenger at your door: "Commander Brightblade 
requests your presence. Command council convenes in one hour."
 
THE COUNCIL CHAMBER
Assembled leadership:
*	Laurana Brightblade (Commander, presiding)
*	Captain Morna (Defense, tactical assessment)
*	Thoric Ironforge (Logistics, practical considerations)
*	Goldmoon (Spiritual counsel, moral guidance)
*	Garrett (Strike team leader, operational perspective)
*	Tanis (Scout/ranger, intelligence insights)
*	You and Kessa (proposing party)
Laurana opens formally:
"Johannes Constantinius has negotiated a conditional agreement 
with an ancient black dragon regarding our planned Pax Tharkas 
liberation. I've reviewed the terms. Now command council will 
debate merits, risks, and whether to ratify."
She gestures to you. "Present the proposal. Then we discuss."
 
YOUR PRESENTATION
You lay it out again-clearly, completely:
*	The strategic problem (can't hold Pax Tharkas after liberation)
*	The dragon solution (territorial claim by neutral sovereign)
*	The terms (what she provides, what she requires, what she won't do)
*	The structure (conditional on Laurana's ratification)
*	The timeline (one month to decide, 2-3 months to execute)
Then you open the floor for questions and debate.
 
THE DEBATE BEGINS
Do you want to:
1.	Play out the full council debate (various leaders raise concerns, you 
address them)
2.	Summarize the key objections and resolutions (faster, hits 
highlights)
3.	Skip to the vote (trust that you've made your case)
What's your preference?
(We can absolutely roleplay the full council session if you want-could be 
interesting to see different perspectives react to dragon diplomacy!)
Summarize the debate
Dec 7
COMMAND COUNCIL DEBATE - 
SUMMARY
THE DISCUSSION
Over two hours, the council debates vigorously:
 
THORIC IRONFORGE - LOGISTICAL CONCERNS
"The practical question: What if evacuation takes longer than 
expected? 700 prisoners, many weak, some sick. Mountain terrain. 
Dragon Army potentially responding. We need time we might not 
have."
Your response: "That's why we plan for 2-3 months of preparation. We 
establish supply caches, coordinate with prisoner leadership inside, time it 
when Verminaard is absent. We control the operation timeline-the dragon 
only arrives after we signal success."
Thoric's conclusion: "If we plan it right, logistics are manageable. And not 
having to prepare for occupation afterward actually simplifies our supply 
requirements significantly. I support it."
 
CAPTAIN MORNA - TACTICAL RISKS
"My concern is Ember. Young red dragons are aggressive, 
territorial, proud. What if she attacks before we've evacuated? The 
dragon won't defend us-we'd be caught between Dragon Army 
reinforcements and an angry red dragon."
Your response: "We time the operation when Ember is absent with 
Verminaard. Intelligence from the captured guards confirms they're 
campaigning together. We don't strike when she's present. And if she returns 
unexpectedly, our evacuation plan includes contingencies for rapid 
withdrawal-we've done it before at Saltmere."
Tanis adds: "I can scout dragon movements. If Ember returns to the region, 
we get advance warning. We don't commit until conditions are optimal."
Morna's conclusion: "Risk exists, but it's manageable with proper 
intelligence and timing. The strategic benefit of permanent denial outweighs 
the tactical complication. I support it."
 
GARRETT - OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE
"We trust a lawful evil dragon because it serves her self-interest. 
But what if Verminaard offers her something better? Bribes her, 
makes a counter-deal, buys her cooperation in returning Pax 
Tharkas to Dragon Army control?"
Your response: "Dragons value reputation and territorial sovereignty above 
temporary wealth. If Khisanth accepts Verminaard's bribe after claiming Pax 
Tharkas, she broadcasts to all dragonkind that her territorial claims are 
negotiable, her oaths unreliable. That costs her far more than any bribe 
Verminaard could offer. Her long-term power depends on other dragons 
respecting her territorial rights-breaking that for short-term gain would be 
strategically idiotic."
Garrett's conclusion: "Fair point. Dragons think in centuries, not quarters. 
Her reputation matters more than Verminaard's gold. I support it."
 
GOLDMOON - MORAL CONSIDERATIONS
The cleric speaks carefully:
"We're making an arrangement with an evil creature to serve a 
good purpose. That troubles some here-I can see it in your faces. 
The question isn't whether Khisanth is good-she's not. The 
question is whether this arrangement compromises our 
principles."
"I believe it doesn't. We're not allying with her. We're not 
endorsing her nature. We're not asking her to harm innocents on 
our behalf. We're simply acknowledging that territorial 
sovereignty exists independent of moral alignment, and that a 
dragon claiming empty territory serves our purpose without 
requiring moral compromise."
"We free the prisoners-that's righteous. We deny Verminaard a 
fortress-that's strategic. What happens to the empty fortress 
afterward is between Verminaard and Khisanth. We're not 
responsible for their conflict any more than we're responsible for 
weather that delays Dragon Army movements."
"This is pragmatism, not corruption. Sometimes serving good 
requires recognizing that not all who oppose our enemies are our 
friends-but their opposition can still serve our cause."
She looks directly at Laurana. "I support this proposal."
(You notice she doesn't mention the Disks-keeping that revelation private 
for now, as is her right.)
 
TANIS - INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE
"The intelligence sharing provision interests me. If Khisanth 
reports Dragon Army movements toward Pax Tharkas, that gives 
us advance warning of Verminaard's strategic intentions. Limited 
cooperation, but valuable nonetheless."
"And frankly, having a territorial dragon between us and Dragon 
Army northern operations creates a buffer. They have to navigate 
dragon diplomacy, account for her presence, potentially divert 
resources. That's friction we didn't create but benefit from."
Tanis's conclusion: "From intelligence and strategic positioning 
standpoint, this is advantageous. I support it."
 
LAURANA - FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
She's listened to everything, saying little.
Now she speaks:
"The strategic case is compelling. The tactical risks are 
manageable. The moral concerns are addressed. The logistical 
challenges are solvable."
"My remaining concern is precedent. If we make deals with evil 
dragons, what does that say about the resistance? Where do we 
draw lines? When does pragmatism become compromise?"
Goldmoon responds: "We draw lines at harming innocents, betraying our 
values, becoming what we fight against. This agreement does none of those 
things. It uses existing power structures-territorial sovereignty, draconic 
law-to achieve liberation without occupation. That's wisdom, not corruption."
Laurana nods slowly. "And if this works-if we successfully negotiate with 
a lawful evil dragon to achieve strategic victory-we demonstrate that 
resistance doesn't mean rigid ideology. It means finding every possible 
advantage, even unexpected ones."
She looks around the table. "All in favor of ratifying Johannes's 
conditional agreement with Khisanth of Xak Tsaroth?"
 
THE VOTE
Captain Morna: "Aye." 
Thoric Ironforge: "Aye." 
Goldmoon: "Aye." 
Garrett: "Aye." 
Tanis: "Aye." 
Kessa: "Aye." 
Laurana: "Aye."
Unanimous.
 
THE RATIFICATION
Laurana stands formally:
"By authority of Haven's command council, I ratify the conditional 
agreement between Johannes Constantinius and Khisanth of Xak 
Tsaroth, subject to the terms as presented:
*	Pax Tharkas liberation executed by resistance forces
*	Complete prisoner evacuation (700 individuals)
*	Fortress substantially intact
*	Khisanth claims territorial sovereignty post-liberation
*	Resistance recognizes her neutral sovereignty
*	No future attempts to occupy or reclaim her territory
*	Limited intelligence cooperation on mutual threats
This agreement is now binding pending successful execution of 
terms."
She looks at you directly. "Inform the dragon. Haven accepts the 
arrangement."
 
IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS
Laurana continues:
"Now we plan Pax Tharkas liberation properly. Captain Morna, 
begin detailed tactical planning. Thoric, logistics for 700-person 
evacuation. Tanis, intelligence gathering on current fortress status. 
Garrett, strike team preparation."
"Johannes, coordinate with Khisanth-confirm ratification, 
establish communication protocol for when we're ready to 
execute."
"Target timeline: 8-10 weeks from now. Late spring, optimal 
weather, Verminaard confirmed absent."
"Dismissed. We have work to do."
 
AFTER THE COUNCIL
Kessa grins at you as you leave. "Unanimous vote. Your spontaneous 
dragon diplomacy just became official resistance strategy."
Goldmoon catches your eye, nods approvingly-supporting you 
without revealing the deeper connection.
Laurana stops you at the door: "Johannes. Well done. Unorthodox, but 
effective. You've solved a problem that's plagued resistance strategy for 
months."
A pause. "Don't make a habit of it. But... good work."
 
CONTACTING KHISANTH
You have the scale. Time to inform her:
Do you:
1.	Contact her immediately (confirm ratification)
2.	Wait until evening (private moment)
3.	Something else
And what do you say?
Privately.
Dec 7
THE CONFIRMATION
EVENING - HAVEN'S WALLS
You wait until after dark, returning to the same spot where you made the 
original contact.
The scale rests in your palm, familiar now. Warm with potential.
"Khisanth. Ancient of Xak Tsaroth. I invoke your attention."
The scale flares warm immediately-she was expecting this.
Her mental voice, amused: "Warlock. I wondered how long your 
commander would deliberate. One day? Impressive efficiency. She is decisive."
 
YOUR REPORT
"Commander Laurana Brightblade has convened command 
council. Full debate, open discussion, consideration of all strategic, 
tactical, logistical, and moral implications."
"The vote was unanimous. Seven leaders, seven votes in favor."
"Haven's resistance formally ratifies the conditional agreement. All 
terms accepted as proposed-fortress substantially intact, 
complete prisoner evacuation, territorial sovereignty recognized, 
limited intelligence cooperation, no future occupation attempts."
"The agreement is now binding, pending successful execution of 
liberation operations."
You pause, then add:
"Target timeline: 8-10 weeks from now. Late spring. We're using 
the time to prepare properly-gather intelligence on current 
fortress status, coordinate with prisoner leadership inside, 
position supplies along evacuation routes, confirm Verminaard 
and Ember remain absent."
"When we're ready to execute, I'll contact you via the scale with 48 
hours notice. You arrive after we signal evacuation complete and 
fortress secured. You claim territorial sovereignty. We withdraw. 
Verminaard finds you in possession."
 
KHISANTH'S SATISFACTION
"Excellent. Your commander is both strategic and practical-rare 
combination among mortals who lead resistance movements. 
Many would have rejected on principle, unable to separate 
effectiveness from ideology."
"8-10 weeks provides adequate preparation time. I will monitor the 
region, ensure I'm positioned to respond when you signal. Pax 
Tharkas is valuable enough that I will prioritize claim-
establishment over other territorial interests during that window."
A thoughtful pause.
"You have orchestrated something unusual here, warlock. A lawful 
evil dragon, a resistance movement fighting tyranny, and a Dragon 
Highlord's fortress-all aligned in arrangement that serves each 
party's interests without requiring any to compromise their 
fundamental nature."
"This is the architecture of functional society. Not friendship. Not 
alliance. Not shared morality. Simply recognition that different 
powers can coexist and even cooperate when agreements serve 
mutual benefit."
 
HER FINAL INSTRUCTIONS
"When you're ready to execute:
Contact me 48 hours before liberation begins. Provide:
*	Exact timing (when you breach the fortress)
*	Expected duration (how long until evacuation complete)
*	Signal protocol (how I'll know you're clear and fortress is mine)
I will position myself within rapid response distance. When you 
signal completion, I arrive visibly, dramatically, and undeniably. 
Verminaard's scouts will witness an ancient black dragon taking 
territorial possession."
"The psychological impact matters. He must understand 
immediately that reclaiming Pax Tharkas means dragon war, not 
resistance suppression."
 
THE ACKNOWLEDGMENT
"You have proven yourself twice now, Johannes Constantinius:"
"First, you honored the trust placed in you regarding the Disks. 
You found a worthy bearer who will serve divine purpose without 
corruption."
"Second, you structured an agreement between fundamentally 
different powers with precision, respect for authority, and 
understanding of obligation."
"These are not common qualities. Most mortals are either too rigid 
in principle or too flexible in honor. You navigate the space 
between-lawful enough to be reliable, pragmatic enough to be 
effective."
A pause, and something that might almost be approval:
"Your patron bound you in darkness, expecting you to serve chaos 
and destruction. Instead, you've become an architect of order-
building alliances, honoring agreements, serving causes greater 
than yourself despite your curse."
"That is ironic. That is admirable. That is why I trust agreements 
made with you."
 
THE PARTING
"Prepare well, warlock. 700 lives depend on your tactical 
execution. My territorial claim depends on your success. 
Verminaard's denial of Pax Tharkas depends on both."
"When you're ready-signal. I will come. And the war changes."
"Until then: fight well, honor your obligations, and remember that 
alignment describes nature, not destiny. You are what you choose 
to be, not what you were bound to become."
The warmth fades from the scale, connection severing cleanly.
 
ALONE AGAIN
You stand on Haven's walls, holding an inert dragon scale that has just 
witnessed the formal ratification of an unprecedented agreement.
In 8-10 weeks:
*	You liberate Pax Tharkas
*	You free 700 prisoners
*	An ancient black dragon claims territorial sovereignty
*	Verminaard loses a key fortress permanently
*	The resistance achieves strategic victory without occupation burden
But first:
*	Intelligence gathering
*	Strike force preparation
*	Prisoner coordination
*	Supply staging
*	Tactical planning
 
KESSA'S VOICE
She finds you again-seems to have a talent for that.
"Dragon satisfied?"
"Agreement confirmed. She'll position herself for rapid response 
when we signal. 48 hours notice, then she claims territory after we 
evacuate."
Kessa leans on the wall beside you. "So now we actually have to pull it 
off. Liberate the most fortified Dragon Army position in the region, 
evacuate 700 prisoners through mountain terrain, keep casualties 
minimal, and leave the fortress intact enough for a dragon to want 
it."
"No pressure."
She grins. "Just another impossible mission. We're getting good at 
those."
 
THE NEXT PHASE
You have 8-10 weeks to prepare for Pax Tharkas.
What do you want to focus on during this time?
1.	Intelligence gathering (detailed fortress layout, guard rotations, 
prisoner leadership contact)
2.	Strike force training (preparing teams for coordinated large-scale 
operation)
3.	Personal development (improving capabilities before the mission)
4.	Strategic planning (working with Laurana on detailed operational 
plan)
5.	Timeskip to mission eve (assume preparation happens, jump to 
deployment)
Where does your focus go?
Time skip.
Dec 7
EIGHT WEEKS LATER - EVE OF 
LIBERATION
LATE SPRING - HAVEN COMMAND CENTER
The war room is transformed.
Maps of Pax Tharkas cover every surface-detailed layouts drawn from:
*	Freed prisoners' memories (including Theron's three-week experience)
*	Defector intelligence (Perin, Jorik, Matthis proving their worth)
*	Scout reconnaissance (Tanis and ranger teams mapping approaches)
*	Captured Dragon Army correspondence (guard rotations, supply 
schedules)
The plan is complete. The forces are ready. The moment has come.
 
HAVEN'S TRANSFORMATION - 8 WEEKS OF 
GROWTH
Population: 1,100 ? 1,400 (continued refugee influx)
Combat Forces:
*	450 trained fighters (up from 350)
*	12 strike teams (including yours, Garrett's, and 10 new teams)
*	50 scouts/rangers (Tanis trained them personally)
*	Medical corps (Goldmoon leading 20 trained healers)
Equipment:
*	Weapons for 500+ fighters (captured, forged, purchased)
*	Supply caches positioned along Pax Tharkas escape routes
*	Medical stations established at safe houses
*	Communication system (signal mirrors, runners, limited sending 
stones)
Morale: High. Word of Westgate Pass success spread. People believe victory 
is possible.
 
YOUR PERSONAL GROWTH - 8 WEEKS
During preparation, you've:
Tactical Leadership:
*	Trained strike team commanders (12 teams now understand your 
methods)
*	Developed coordinated assault doctrine (small units working together)
*	Practiced large-scale evacuation protocols (moving hundreds under 
pressure)
Intelligence Work:
*	Established contact with Elistan (prisoner leader inside Pax Tharkas 
via smuggled messages)
*	Confirmed current garrison strength (620 soldiers, Commander 
Blacksteel present)
*	Verified Verminaard and Ember still absent (northern campaign 
continues)
*	Identified weak points in fortress defenses (prisoner intelligence 
invaluable)
Magical Development:
*	Mastered Shadow of Moil in various terrain (practiced extensively)
*	Refined Hex curse transfer timing (instant targeting)
*	Coordinated Eldritch Blast fire patterns with other ranged attackers
Strategic Planning:
*	Worked with Laurana on overall operational plan
*	Coordinated with Thoric on logistics (food, medical, transport for 700)
*	Established dragon communication protocol (48-hour notice system)
 
THE FINAL BRIEFING - TONIGHT
Full command council plus all 12 strike team leaders.
Laurana presides, maps illuminated by lamplight:
 
OPERATION OVERVIEW
"Operation Liberation. Objective: Free 700 prisoners from Pax 
Tharkas, deny the fortress to Dragon Army permanently."
"Timeline:
*	H-Hour (Dawn, Day 1): Assault begins
*	H+6 hours: Fortress secured, prisoners liberated
*	H+12 hours: Evacuation begins (first wave: 200 able-bodied)
*	Day 2: Continued evacuation (second wave: 300 assisted)
*	Day 3: Final evacuation (third wave: 200 weakest, plus wounded)
*	Day 3 Evening: Dragon claim established, resistance withdraws
"Forces committed:
*	300 fighters (assault and security)
*	50 scouts (intelligence and guidance)
*	20 healers (medical support)
*	100 support personnel (logistics, evacuation coordination)
"Haven maintains 150 fighters for defense. We're not leaving our 
base unprotected."
 
ASSAULT PLAN - PHASE 1: BREACH
Captain Morna presents:
"The fortress has one main gate, heavily defended. We don't attack 
there."
"Instead: The mines."
She points to the map. "Prisoners work in mines that connect to 
fortress interior. Elistan and prisoner leadership will create a 
'collapse' in one tunnel at dawn-staged accident that draws guards 
away from other sections."
"Strike teams 1-4 (including Johannes and Garrett's teams) 
infiltrate through secondary mine entrance during distraction. 40 
elite fighters inside fortress walls before Dragon Army realizes 
we're not a riot, we're an invasion."
"Teams 5-8 assault the main gate from outside-full frontal attack, 
drawing garrison attention. They don't expect to breach quickly; 
they're the distraction."
"Teams 9-12 scale the walls on the south side using ropes and 
grapples-fortress garrison will be focused on gate and mine crisis. 
40 more fighters inside from unexpected direction."
"Total: 120 fighters inside fortress walls within 30 minutes. Dragon 
Army garrison of 620 soldiers will be divided, confused, 
responding to three simultaneous threats."
 
ASSAULT PLAN - PHASE 2: PRISONER LIBERATION
Thoric explains:
"Once inside, strike teams proceed to prisoner barracks and work 
areas. Elistan and prisoner leaders have been organizing for 
weeks-they know who can fight, who needs immediate medical 
attention, who can help with evacuation."
"We distribute weapons to able-bodied prisoners (approximately 
150 can fight). Former soldiers, hunters, anyone with combat 
capability. Suddenly Dragon Army faces not 120 resistance fighters 
but 270+ armed opponents inside their own fortress."
"Goldmoon's medical teams establish triage stations in secured 
areas. Critical cases treated immediately. Walking wounded 
stabilized for evacuation."
"Tanis's scouts secure escape routes-ensure mine tunnels, 
southern gates, and mountain passes are clear for evacuation."
 
ASSAULT PLAN - PHASE 3: FORTRESS CONTROL
Laurana continues:
"Our objective is not to hold Pax Tharkas long-term-it's to control 
it long enough to evacuate everyone safely."
"Key targets:
*	Commander Blacksteel (eliminate or neutralize leadership)
*	Barracks (secure or destroy Dragon Army reinforcement points)
*	Gate mechanisms (open southern gates for evacuation routes)
*	Supply depots (deny Dragon Army resources, acquire for evacuation)
*	Communication towers (prevent signals for reinforcements)
"Johannes, your strike team takes Blacksteel. He's the command 
center. Eliminate him, and garrison coordination collapses."
You nod. That's your mission.
 
EVACUATION PLAN
Thoric details:
"Three waves over three days:
Wave 1 (Day 1, 200 people): Able-bodied prisoners who can march 
immediately. They move fastest, establish first safe house positions, prepare 
for later waves.
Wave 2 (Day 2, 300 people): Those needing assistance-elderly, 
malnourished, sick but mobile. Paired with helpers, transported via wagons 
where possible.
Wave 3 (Day 3, 200 people): Weakest prisoners, critically injured, plus 
any resistance wounded. Requires most medical support and transport assets.
"Safe houses positioned every 8-10 miles along escape route. Food, 
water, medical supplies pre-staged. Transport wagons waiting at 
each station."
"Final destination: Haven and three satellite settlements. We're 
not concentrating all 700 in one location-spreads risk, spreads 
resources, spreads opportunity."
 
THE DRAGON PROTOCOL
Laurana looks at you:
"Johannes, you signal Khisanth when?"
"48 hours from now-dawn, Day 1, when assault begins. That gives 
her time to position."
"And she arrives when?"
"Evening, Day 3, after we've evacuated and withdrawn. We'll leave 
signal markers showing evacuation complete. She makes her 
territorial claim, we're already gone."
Laurana nods. "And if things go wrong? If evacuation takes longer, if 
Dragon Army reinforcements arrive early, if Ember returns 
unexpectedly?"
"We signal abort. Dragon doesn't come. We extract what forces we 
can and accept partial victory rather than total catastrophe."
 
TEAM ASSIGNMENTS - YOUR STRIKE TEAM
Strike Team 1 (Your command):
*	Johannes (team leader, heavy firepower)
*	Kessa (second-in-command, assassination specialist)
*	Rickard (veteran fighter, knows Dragon Army tactics)
*	Goldmoon (healer, divine support) - temporarily attached for 
Blacksteel elimination
*	Perin, Jorik, Matthis (defectors, Dragon Army knowledge)
*	4 Haven fighters (trained, loyal, capable)
Total: 10 fighters
Mission: Eliminate Commander Blacksteel, seize command center, 
disrupt garrison coordination.
 
THE MOMENT BEFORE
Laurana addresses the assembled leaders:
"Tomorrow, we attempt something unprecedented. We're 
attacking the second-most fortified Dragon Army position in the 
region with 300 fighters against 620 soldiers in a fortress designed 
to resist armies."
"We're liberating 700 prisoners who've been enslaved, brutalized, 
and worked nearly to death."
"We're denying Verminaard a strategic asset he's held for years."
"And we're doing it in coordination with an ancient black dragon 
who will claim what we cannot hold."
"This is audacious. This is dangerous. This is exactly what 
resistance means."
She raises her cup. "To freedom. To courage. To the 700 lives we're 
bringing home."
Everyone echoes: "To freedom!"
 
THAT NIGHT - BEFORE DAWN
You stand on Haven's walls one final time before departure.
Kessa finds you. Always does.
"Big day tomorrow. Biggest yet."
"Yeah."
"You ready?"
You consider-the months of preparation, the training, the planning, the 
coordination with a dragon, the weight of 700 lives depending on success.
"As ready as we'll ever be."
She grins. "That'll have to be enough. Get some sleep. Dawn comes 
early."
 
DAWN - DEPARTURE
300 fighters march from Haven toward Pax Tharkas.
12 strike teams, moving in coordinated columns.
Scouts ranging ahead, medical teams in support, logistics 
personnel managing supplies.
This is not a raid. This is not an assassination. This is an army-
small, but real-marching to war.
 
48 HOURS TO ASSAULT
During the march, you activate the dragon scale:
"Khisanth. We execute at dawn, two days from now. Expected 
fortress control within 6 hours. Evacuation over 3 days. Signal you 
on evening of Day 3 when clear. Position for rapid response."
Her reply is immediate: "Confirmed. I will be ready. Execute with 
precision, warlock. 700 lives and territorial claim depend on it. Do 
not fail."
The scale goes cold.
 
EVE OF BATTLE - STAGING AREA
Five miles from Pax Tharkas, hidden in mountain valley.
The fortress is visible in the distance-massive stone walls, guard towers, the 
symbol of Dragon Army power and prisoner suffering.
Tomorrow at dawn, you attack.
 
FINAL PREPARATIONS
Do you want to:
1.	Speak with anyone (Kessa, Goldmoon, Garrett, Laurana, your team)
2.	Final equipment check (loadout verification)
3.	Timeskip to assault beginning (dawn, H-Hour)
Or anything else before the battle begins?
And we have to anticipate evil clerics, so the disks will be welcome... though 
Lauranna still doesn't know
Dec 7
THE REVELATION
TACTICAL BRIEFING - EVENING BEFORE 
ASSAULT
Your strike team gathers for final mission prep.
You're reviewing the Blacksteel elimination plan when Goldmoon speaks up:
"Commander, there's something the council should know before 
we breach that fortress."
She's been quiet all evening, but now her voice carries weight.
"The dark clerics of Takhisis inside Pax Tharkas-approximately 
five, according to intelligence. They'll use divine magic against us. 
Fear spells, curses, dark healing for Dragon Army forces, possibly 
worse."
Laurana nods grimly. "We've accounted for that. Goldmoon, your healing 
and protection spells will counter what you can, but you're one cleric against 
five."
Goldmoon stands, her expression serene but purposeful.
"Not exactly."
 
THE DISKS REVEALED
She reaches into her pack and withdraws them-carefully wrapped, but now 
she lets the cloth fall away.
The Disks of Mishakal blaze with blue-white light.
The immediate area around your strike team floods with divine radiance-
warm, protective, unmistakably powerful.
Gasps. Stunned silence.
Laurana stares. "Those are... are those..."
"The Disks of Mishakal," Goldmoon confirms. "The ancient artifacts 
of my goddess. Lost since the Cataclysm. Found in Xak Tsaroth. 
Entrusted to Johannes by the dragon Khisanth with instruction to 
find a worthy bearer."
She looks at you with gratitude. "He chose me. Eight weeks ago, after 
Operation Westgate. He gave them to me because I would serve 
them, not use them for my own purposes."
 
LAURANA'S REACTION
The Commander's expression cycles through shock, confusion, 
then understanding.
"You've had these for eight weeks. Divine artifacts of immense 
power. And you didn't tell me."
It's not quite accusation-more bewilderment.
Goldmoon responds calmly: "It was not mine to announce. The decision 
was Johannes's to make-who received them and when to reveal them. I have 
been... preparing. Learning their capabilities. Ensuring I could wield them 
properly when the moment demanded it."
She looks at Laurana directly. "Tomorrow, we face five dark clerics 
channeling Takhisis's power in a fortress they've consecrated to 
their goddess. They'll have divine advantage, ritual preparations, 
unholy ground empowering their magic."
"The Disks equalize that. Mishakal's power channels through me-
healing becomes more potent, protection spells stronger, divine 
radiance that literally repels darkness. I become a counter to their 
entire dark clerical presence."
 
THE TACTICAL IMPACT
Captain Morna, present for the briefing, assesses immediately:
"Five dark clerics were our biggest unknown. They could break 
morale with fear spells, sustain Dragon Army fighters with dark 
healing, possibly raise undead from casualties. We had no effective 
counter."
"Now we do." She looks at the Disks with something like awe. "One cleric 
with the Disks of Mishakal versus five Takhisis cultists. That 
changes the entire divine battlefield."
 
GOLDMOON'S EXPLANATION
"Here's what the Disks provide in tomorrow's battle:
1. Mass Healing: "I can channel healing across dozens at once. Wounded 
fighters stay in the fight. Dying prisoners stabilized instantly."
2. Protection from Evil: "Aura that makes it harder for dark magic to affect 
those near me. Fear spells weakened. Curses resisted."
3. Turn Undead - Enhanced: "If they raise corpses as undead soldiers, I 
can destroy them with radiance, not just repel them."
4. Divine Smite: "My weapon strikes carry holy power. Against unholy 
enemies-dark clerics, fiends, corrupted creatures-devastating."
5. Consecration: "I can sanctify ground, creating zones where darkness 
struggles to manifest. Their ritual spaces become contested."
6. Beacon of Hope: "Visible symbol that divine power opposes tyranny. 
Psychological impact on prisoners-they see Mishakal's light and know the 
gods haven't abandoned them."
 
LAURANA PROCESSES
She's silent for a long moment.
Then: "Johannes. You gave away artifacts of immense power. To 
Goldmoon, not to resistance command, not to military advantage, 
not to political leverage."
"Because you understood they weren't tools. They were sacred 
objects that needed a servant, not a wielder."
She nods slowly. "And you, Goldmoon, kept them private until the 
moment their revelation would serve the mission rather than 
become a distraction."
"Both of you made decisions I would not have made. Both decisions 
were... correct."
She stands, approaches Goldmoon. "Tomorrow, when you face those 
dark clerics, Mishakal's light will shine through you. And 700 
prisoners will see divine power stands against darkness."
To you: "You've made two dragon bargains now-one with Khisanth 
for the Disks' delivery, one for Pax Tharkas territorial claim. Both 
serve the resistance better than any conventional strategy I could 
have designed."
"I'm beginning to think your curse is offset by uncanny judgment."
 
KESSA'S WHISPERED COMMENT
She leans close: "Laurana just complimented your judgment while 
learning you've been hiding legendary divine artifacts and making 
dragon deals. That's either very good or she's too stunned to be 
angry yet."
 
THE TEAM'S MORALE
Your strike team-the ones who'll face Blacksteel and the dark 
clerics-looks at the Disks with renewed confidence.
Rickard: "We're assaulting a fortress with a warlock, a cleric carrying divine 
artifacts, and three Dragon Army defectors who know every protocol. This 
might actually work."
Perin: "I was terrified of those dark clerics. They make Dragon Army soldiers 
do terrible things with fear magic. Now..." He looks at Goldmoon. "Now we 
have a chance."
 
GOLDMOON'S FINAL WORDS
"The Disks don't make me invincible. I can still fall. The dark 
clerics are experienced, powerful, and fighting on consecrated 
ground."
"But tomorrow, when we breach that fortress, prisoners will see 
blue light blazing against their captors' darkness. They'll know 
divine power hasn't abandoned them."
"And the dark clerics will learn that Takhisis's tyranny is opposed 
by Mishakal's mercy-and mercy is not weakness. Mercy is the 
strength to fight for those who cannot fight for themselves."
The Disks pulse with warm light as if approving her words.
 
LAURANA'S FINAL ORDERS
"Then our plan is complete:
*	Strike teams breach at dawn
*	Johannes eliminates Blacksteel
*	Goldmoon counters dark clerics
*	We liberate 700 prisoners
*	We evacuate over three days
*	Dragon claims the fortress
*	Verminaard loses Pax Tharkas permanently
All forces, all capabilities, all advantages deployed. Tomorrow, we 
win."
She looks around at the assembled fighters. "Rest. Pray if you're inclined. 
Prepare your souls as well as your weapons. Dawn brings the 
largest battle Haven has ever fought."
"Dismissed."
 
THAT NIGHT
The Disks' revelation has changed everything-and nothing.
The plan remains the same. But now everyone knows that when your strike 
team faces Commander Blacksteel and his dark clerics, you'll have divine 
power on your side.
Do you:
1.	Speak with Goldmoon privately (about the Disks, the battle, trust)
2.	Talk to your strike team (final coordination before dawn)
3.	Find Laurana (address the revelation, ensure understanding)
4.	Rest (sleep before battle)
5.	Something else
What's your final action before H-Hour?
Rest. 
This next phase is going to t take a bit, so let's create a summary of 
everything, with a good character bio for Kessa and I, updated inventories and 
key points affecting future storyline that I can copy paste
Dec 7

KEY RELATIONSHIPS
Kessa "Keys" Darrow: Partner, closest confidant, knows everything about 
the curse. Only person who's stayed close long-term without dying (travels 
together, never settles).
Laurana Brightblade: Resistance commander. Respects Johannes's tactical 
brilliance but concerned about his unorthodox methods (dragon diplomacy). 
Relationship is professional, mutual respect.
Goldmoon: Cleric of Mishakal, bearer of the Disks. Johannes chose her as 
worthy recipient. She understands his burden, provides spiritual counsel 
without judgment.
Khisanth: Ancient black dragon. Unlikely mutual respect based on both 
being lawful and keeping their word. Two agreements: (1) Deliver Disks to 
worthy bearer (complete), (2) Pax Tharkas territorial claim (in progress).
Garrett & Crew: Former guards he recruited/redeemed. Now loyal strike 
team leaders. Prove that redemption is possible.
 
CHARACTER: KESSA "KEYS" DARROW

Personality:
*	Pragmatic and direct
*	Fierce loyalty to Johannes (knows about curse, chooses to stay anyway)
*	Dark humor, especially in tense situations
*	Strategic thinker who complements Johannes's planning
*	No patience for unnecessary moralism-results matter
*	Protective of those she considers "hers"
 
ABILITIES & COMBAT STYLE

Sneak Attack: 3d6 
Uncanny Dodge (reaction to halve damage)
Expertise Skills:
*	Stealth +7
*	Thieves' Tools +7
*	Deception +7

ROLE IN THE PARTNERSHIP
Tactical: Handles stealth reconnaissance, infiltration, precision elimination 
of key targets. Complements Johannes's ranged magical firepower with 
physical precision.
Social: Better at gathering intelligence through conversation, reading people, 
managing interpersonal dynamics. Johannes focuses on big-picture strategy; 
Kessa handles ground-level details.
Emotional: Provides grounding for Johannes. Reminds him he's not alone, 
that his curse doesn't define him, that his choices matter more than his 
binding.
Strategic: Questions his plans constructively, identifies flaws, suggests 
alternatives. Not a yes-woman-genuine partner in decision-making.
 
HER STORY WITH JOHANNES
How long they've known each other: Years (exact timeline unclear)
Why she stays despite the curse: Choice and loyalty. She knows the risk. 
She knows people die near him. She chooses to stay anyway because she 
believes in who he is, not what he's bound to.
Their dynamic:
*	Deep trust (she knows everything)
*	Professional respect (both tactically capable)
*	Genuine friendship (rare for both of them)
*	No romantic overtones-partnership of choice, not attraction
*	She calls him out when he's wrong
*	He trusts her judgment implicitly

*	Winter in Solace for recovery/planning
6. DISKS OF MISHAKAL DECISION
*	Chose Goldmoon as worthy bearer (after 8 weeks consideration)
*	Reasoning: She needs them because she has no need for them-will 
serve the Disks rather than use them for personal agenda
*	Revealed to Khisanth that task was complete
7. PAX THARKAS DRAGON DIPLOMACY
*	Proposed territorial agreement with Khisanth
*	Resistance liberates fortress + evacuates prisoners
*	Dragon claims territorial sovereignty afterward

*	Mining operations cease (resources become hers)
What Khisanth Provides:
*	Territorial claim (becomes Verminaard's diplomatic problem)
*	Ember deterrent (peer dragon in fortified position)
*	Intelligence sharing (limited cooperation on mutual threats)
What Khisanth Will NOT Do:
*	Fight during liberation
*	Defend retreat if operation fails
*	Act as ally beyond territorial self-interest
Communication Protocol:

*	Signal when evacuation complete (she arrives and claims)
*	Positioned for rapid response (ready when called)
Status: Agreement ratified. Khisanth notified. Assault begins in hours.
 
PAX THARKAS ASSAULT PLAN (H-HOUR: 
DAWN)
PHASE 1: BREACH (H+0 to H+30 minutes)
Three Simultaneous Attacks:
1.	Mine Infiltration (Strike Teams 1-4, 40 fighters)
*	Elistan creates staged "collapse" distraction
*	Teams infiltrate through secondary mine entrance
*	Johannes's team (Strike Team 1) targets Commander Blacksteel
*	Inside fortress walls before garrison realizes scale of attack
2.	Main Gate Assault (Strike Teams 5-8, 40 fighters)
*	Frontal attack, draws garrison attention
*	Not expected to breach quickly-they're the distraction
*	Pins Dragon Army forces while infiltration happens
3.	South Wall Scaling (Strike Teams 9-12, 40 fighters)
*	Ropes and grappling hooks
*	Garrison focused on gate and mines
*	40 more fighters inside from unexpected direction
Result: 120 elite fighters inside fortress within 30 minutes, Dragon Army 
divided and confused.
 
PHASE 2: LIBERATION (H+30 minutes to H+6 hours)
Key Objectives:
1.	Eliminate Commander Blacksteel (Strike Team 1 - Johannes, 
Kessa, Goldmoon, Rickard, +6)
*	Remove command leadership
*	Collapse garrison coordination
*	Goldmoon counters dark clerics with Disks of Mishakal
2.	Free Prisoners (Multiple teams)
*	Elistan and prisoner leadership organize from inside
*	Distribute weapons to ~150 able-bodied prisoners
*	Suddenly 270+ armed fighters vs. 620 Dragon Army
3.	Secure Key Positions
*	Barracks (prevent reinforcement)
*	Gate mechanisms (open for evacuation)
*	Supply depots (acquire resources, deny to enemy)
*	Communication towers (prevent calls for help)
4.	Medical Triage (Goldmoon's teams)
*	Establish treatment stations
*	Critical cases stabilized
*	Walking wounded prepared for evacuation
 
PHASE 3: EVACUATION (Days 1-3)

PHASE 4: DRAGON CLAIM (Day 3 Evening)
Sequence:
1.	Final evacuation complete
2.	Resistance withdraws from fortress
3.	Signal markers left showing empty
4.	Khisanth arrives (dramatic, visible, undeniable)
5.	Claims territorial sovereignty

STRIKE TEAM 1 - BLACKSTEEL ELIMINATION
Commander: Johannes Constantinius 
Second: Kessa Darrow 
Special Attachment: Goldmoon (counter to dark clerics)
Team Members:
*	Rickard (veteran, Dragon Army tactics knowledge)
*	Perin, Jorik, Matthis (defectors, inside knowledge)
*	4 Haven trained fighters
Total: 10 fighters
Mission: Eliminate Commander Blacksteel, neutralize dark clerics, seize 
command center, disrupt garrison coordination.
Expected Opposition:
*	Blacksteel himself (hobgoblin veteran, experienced commander)
*	Personal guard (elite soldiers)
*	5 dark clerics of Takhisis (divine magic, fear spells, dark healing)
*	Command center garrison
Key Assets:
*	Johannes: Heavy magical firepower, tactical leadership
*	Kessa: Precision assassination, stealth capability
*	Goldmoon: Disks of Mishakal (counter to dark clerics, mass healing, 
divine power)
*	Team: Combat-tested, coordinated, motivated
 
DISKS OF MISHAKAL (REVEALED)
Current Bearer: Goldmoon 
Given by: Johannes (8 weeks ago, after Operation Westgate) 
Revealed: Eve of Pax Tharkas assault
Capabilities in Battle:
1.	Mass Healing (dozens at once)
2.	Protection from Evil (aura weakens dark magic)
3.	Enhanced Turn Undead (destroy, not just repel)
4.	Divine Smite (holy damage vs. unholy enemies)
5.	Consecration (sanctify ground, contest dark ritual spaces)
6.	Beacon of Hope (visible symbol, psychological impact)
Tactical Impact: Equalizes divine battlefield. One cleric with Disks vs. five 
dark clerics becomes manageable fight instead of overwhelming disadvantage.
Laurana's Reaction: Surprised but understanding. Acknowledged 
Johannes made correct decision (servant not wielder), Goldmoon made 
correct decision (revealed when mission needed it, not for attention).

THEMES & CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT
JOHANNES
*	Curse vs. Choice: Bound to demon but defined by decisions, not 
binding
*	Law over Alignment: Understands structure, honor, obligation 
matter more than good/evil labels
*	Pragmatic Morality: Willing to work with evil entities (Khisanth) to 
serve good purposes without moral compromise
*	Leadership: Leads through competence, delegation, trust-not 
authority or charisma
*	Burden of Command: Responsible for lives, decisions, consequences
*	Seeking Freedom: Long-term goal to break pact, reclaim soul
KESSA
*	Loyalty by Choice: Stays with Johannes despite curse danger
*	Pragmatic Partnership: Results matter, methods are tools
*	Competence Respect: Values capability over morality
*	Protective Instincts: Fiercely guards those she considers "hers"
*	Mystery: Her past largely unexplored-potential for future 
development
RESISTANCE
*	Hope through Action: Proving resistance can win, not just survive
*	Unconventional Strategies: Dragon diplomacy, defector 
recruitment, precision strikes over conventional warfare
*	Growing Movement: From desperate refugees to organized military 
force
*	Moral Complexity: Working with evil dragons, accepting reformed 
enemies, pragmatic decisions
 
POWER PROGRESSION
Level 7 Current Status
Next Level (8) Potential:
*	Additional spell slots
*	New invocation
*	Increased power
Future Considerations:
*	Curse breaking might require significant power/resources
*	Pact alternatives if curse broken
*	Magical item acquisition continuing
*	Dragon relationships developing
 
CRITICAL RELATIONSHIPS GOING FORWARD
Laurana: Trust but concern over unconventional methods. Will she continue 
supporting Johannes's bold strategies, or will there be friction?
Goldmoon: Deep spiritual connection through Disks decision. She 
understands his burden, provides counsel without judgment.
Khisanth: Unprecedented lawful evil ally. Relationship based on mutual 
respect for keeping word. Future cooperation possible if interests align.
Kessa: Unshakable partnership. Only person who truly knows everything and 
chooses to stay.
 
UPCOMING: PAX THARKAS LIBERATION
Stakes:
*	700 lives
*	Largest resistance operation ever attempted
*	Dragon agreement depends on success
*	Potential for heavy casualties
*	Verminaard's permanent loss of key fortress
*	Proof resistance can win major victories
Challenges:
*	620 Dragon Army soldiers
*	Commander Blacksteel (experienced garrison commander)
*	5 dark clerics with divine magic
*	Fortified position
*	Mass evacuation under potential pursuit
*	Timing (must complete before reinforcements arrive)
Advantages:
*	Surprise (attack at dawn)
*	Three-pronged assault
*	Inside coordination (Elistan and prisoners)
*	Goldmoon with Disks (counter to dark clerics)
*	Elite strike teams (battle-tested)
*	Verminaard and Ember absent
Success Criteria:
*	All or most prisoners evacuated alive
*	Fortress secured long enough for evacuation
*	Acceptable casualties (resistance can afford losses but not catastrophic)
*	Khisanth's claim established without complications

If I add this to the library for this project, it becomes immediately and 
persistently available, right?
Dec 7
Yes, exactly! If you upload this document to the project's knowledge base, it 
will:
1.	Be immediately available - I can reference it in our current 
conversation and all future conversations in this project
2.	Persist permanently - It stays in the project knowledge until you 
remove it
3.	Be searchable - I can search through it to find specific details when 
needed
4.	Work across sessions - Even if we start a completely new chat in this 
project, I'll still have access to it
This is perfect for a campaign like this where we need to maintain continuity 
across multiple sessions. You can update it as the campaign progresses too - 
just upload a revised version.
