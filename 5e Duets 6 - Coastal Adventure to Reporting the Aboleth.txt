
5e Duets/
Two things: Johannes had leveled up; let's level up Kessa and Cyril accordingly. 
Since you RP their characters, i leave the choices up to you. 
2) Are we ready to begin a new adventure? You can select from the options in 
the a project library or create a new scenario of your own. Whatever you 
select, no spoilers! Not even an scenario or module name or reference.
Dec 8
Excellent! Let me handle the companion level-ups first:
Kessa "Keys" Darrow - Leveling to 7th (Rogue 5/Bard 2)
*	Hit Points: +5 (6 + CON modifier)
*	Rogue 5 Features: Uncanny Dodge (reaction to halve damage from an 
attacker she can see)
*	Proficiency Bonus: Increases to +3
*	Sneak Attack: Now 3d6
Brother Cyril - Leveling to 7th (Cleric 7)
*	Hit Points: +5 (6 + CON modifier)
*	Cleric 7 Features: 4th-level spell slots
*	New Spells Prepared: Death Ward, Guardian of Faith
*	Channel Divinity: Can now use twice per rest
Both are now formidable companions who've grown alongside Johannes 
through your adventures.
 
Now, I've selected something from the library that I think fits perfectly where 
Johannes is right now - a coastal adventure with mystery elements, 
opportunities for investigation and stealth, moral complexity, and the 
potential for acquiring interesting items. The setting will be refreshingly 
different from your recent mountain fortress and military campaign work.
You'll be starting in a fishing village where something is deeply wrong. The 
locals are afraid, ships have gone missing, and there are whispers of things in 
the water that shouldn't be there.
Ready to begin? Johannes, Kessa, and Cyril are traveling together. Where 
are you coming from, and what brings you to this particular stretch of coast?
Even that description is too much detail. Sorry to complain, but I don't want to 
know what I am getting into. Scratch and retry?
Dec 8
You're absolutely right - my apologies!
 
Ready to begin?
Johannes, Kessa, and Cyril are traveling together along a coastal road. It's late 
afternoon, and you can smell salt air on the breeze.
Where are you three coming from, and what's your general destination or 
purpose for traveling this direction?
Let's try a better intro. This is really vague
Dec 8
You're right - let me give you an actual opening scene without telegraphing 
what's ahead:
 
The three of you have been on the road for two days since leaving the city of 
Seaton, following the coast road south. The autumn air carries the sharp scent 
of brine, and gulls wheel overhead as the afternoon sun slants toward the 
western horizon.
Kessa rides ahead on her mare, occasionally glancing back at you and Cyril 
with that restless energy she gets when she's been away from "civilization" - 
meaning gambling halls and theaters - for too long. Brother Cyril walks 
steadily beside your horse, his weathered face peaceful as he observes the 
coastal landscape.
As you round a bend where the road follows the cliff edge, Kessa reins in her 
horse and points ahead. About a mile distant, you can see a small settlement 
where the road descends to meet a natural harbor. Fishing boats are pulled up 
on the beach, and a cluster of buildings huddles around what appears to be a 
modest dock.
"Finally," Kessa says. "My backside is ready for an actual chair and my throat 
is ready for something that isn't trail rations and canteen water."
Brother Cyril shades his eyes, studying the town. "Looks quiet."
What do you do?
Head into town
Dec 8
You continue down the coastal road as it winds toward the settlement. As you 
draw closer, you can make out more details - perhaps two dozen buildings in 
total, most of them simple wooden structures with weathered shingles. A 
larger building near the harbor has a faded sign you can't quite read yet. 
Several fishing boats are beached, their hulls dark against the sand.
The road brings you into what passes for the town's main street - really just a 
wider stretch of packed earth between buildings. A few locals are visible: an 
older woman hanging laundry, a man mending a net outside one of the 
cottages, a couple of children who stop their play to stare at you with wide eyes 
before their mother hurries them inside.
The larger building you spotted earlier resolves into a two-story structure with 
a sign reading "The Whalebone Inn." Smoke rises from its chimney, and you 
can hear muffled voices from within.
Kessa dismounts with visible relief. "Please tell me they have actual beds and 
actual food."
Brother Cyril is studying the town with a slight frown. "Notice anything about 
the boats?"
He's right - now that you're closer, you can see that while several fishing boats 
are pulled up on the beach, they look... unused. Nets are piled beside them, 
but there's no activity around the docks. No fishermen preparing for an 
evening catch, no one unloading the day's haul.
What do you do?
Head into the inn
Dec 8
You dismount and tie your horses outside the Whalebone Inn. The building's 
wooden sign creaks in the sea breeze, showing a carved whale's rib bone that's 
seen better days.
Pushing open the door, you're met with the familiar smell of wood smoke, 
cooking fish, and ale. The common room is dimly lit by a hearth fire and a few 
tallow candles. A handful of patrons sit scattered at tables - all locals by the 
look of them, weathered faces and rough clothing. Conversation dies as you 
enter, heads turning to assess the newcomers.
Behind the bar stands a heavyset man in his fifties, balding, with the red-
veined nose of someone who samples his own stock regularly. He wipes down 
the counter with a rag that's seen cleaner days.
"Travelers," he says, neither welcoming nor hostile. "Don't get many this time 
of year. Looking for rooms or just a meal?"
Kessa moves toward the bar with practiced ease, already assessing the room. 
You notice the patrons have returned to their conversations, but they're 
quieter now, more guarded. One table near the hearth has three men who keep 
glancing your way - not threatening, but definitely watching.
Brother Cyril stays near the door, his hand resting unconsciously near his 
mace.
The innkeeper waits for your answer, his expression carefully neutral.
What do you say or do?
Both, I think.
Dec 8
The innkeeper nods, some of the tension leaving his shoulders. "Aye, can do 
that. Three silver for the night gets you two rooms upstairs - share how you 
like - and supper's another silver piece each. Stew's hot, bread's fresh this 
morning, and the ale's decent."
He pulls out a heavy ledger and a stub of charcoal. "Name for the book?"
Before you can answer, Kessa leans against the bar with an easy smile. "What's 
the catch of the day? I saw boats on the beach but no fish being brought in."
The innkeeper's expression shutters slightly. "Stew's got fish in it. That's 
what's for supper."
One of the men at the hearth table - grizzled, maybe sixty, with hands scarred 
from years of working nets - speaks up. "Boats ain't going out, miss. Haven't 
been for near a week now."
"Tam," the innkeeper says, a warning in his voice.
The old fisherman - Tam - just shrugs and takes a pull from his mug. "They're 
travelers, Aldric. They'll hear it soon enough anyway."
The innkeeper - Aldric - sets his jaw, then turns back to you. "We've had... 
some trouble. But it's local business. Nothing to concern visitors." His tone 
makes it clear he doesn't want to discuss it further.
The common room has gone quiet again, everyone listening.
What do you do?
Well, if you've got it all in hand. We're here by way of Haven. They send us out 
as...well, professional problem revolvers. No cost, Haven takes care of all that, 
but with the Dragon Army mucking about, there always seems to be issues 
that need to be addressed. That's what we do.
Dec 8
There's a long moment of silence. Aldric's eyes narrow slightly, studying you 
with new interest. The men at the hearth table exchange glances.
"Haven," Tam says slowly, setting down his mug. "That's... a fair distance 
north. Dragon Army's been causing trouble up that way?"
Aldric wipes the same spot on the bar he's already cleaned three times. 
"Problem solvers," he mutters, almost to himself. Then, louder: "Haven's help 
is... appreciated, I'm sure. But like I said, this is local business."
One of the younger men at the hearth - perhaps thirty, with a thick beard - 
stands abruptly. "Local business that's got half the town too scared to set foot 
near the water, Aldric. My family's been fishing these waters for three 
generations and now my nets sit rotting on the beach."
"Sit down, Marten," Aldric says wearily.
Marten doesn't sit. He turns to face you directly. "A week ago, the Silver 
Catch went out for the night run. She never came back. Three good men on 
that boat, including my brother. Two nights later, the Wavecrest tried going 
out - came back before dawn with the crew half-mad with fear, talking about... 
things in the water."
"Enough," Aldric snaps.
Old Tam snorts into his ale. "Boy's right. Council can keep trying to keep it 
quiet, but that won't feed families or find the missing."
What do you do?
Look, we here to solve problems, not cause them, not make them worse. If you 
want help, tell us more. If not, we'll be happy for those bowls of stew, a good 
night's rest in a bed, and we'll be off with the morning tide.
Dec 8
Aldric studies you for a long moment, then lets out a heavy breath. He tosses 
the rag onto the bar.
"Marten, close the shutters. If we're doing this, I don't need the whole damned 
town knowing the Council's business got aired to strangers."
Marten moves to comply, pulling the wooden shutters closed over the 
windows. The common room grows dimmer, lit only by hearth and candles 
now. The other patrons shift closer - clearly they want to hear this too.
Aldric pours himself a drink and downs it in one swallow. "Alright. Here's 
what we know, which isn't much and none of it good."
He leans against the bar. "Week ago, like Marten said, the Silver 
Catch disappeared. We thought maybe they'd capsized, bad luck, happens 
sometimes. But then the Wavecrest went out two nights later. They came back 
at dawn, crew in a state. Said they saw something out past the reef - lights 
under the water, moving. And shapes. Big shapes."
Tam speaks up. "Not just that. They said they heard singing. Not human 
singing - something else. Drew them toward the rocks before their captain got 
sense enough to turn about."
"Since then," Aldric continues, "nobody's willing to go out. Can't say I blame 
them. But it's more than that." He hesitates, glances at the door despite it 
being closed. "Three nights ago, old Willem was walking the beach at dusk. 
Says he saw figures coming out of the water. Walked right up onto the sand, he 
said, then back into the waves. Council thinks he's been into the bottle, but..."
"But Willem hasn't touched drink in five years," Tam finishes. "Man's sober as 
stone."
Brother Cyril speaks for the first time since entering. "Has anyone gone 
missing from the town itself? Besides the fishermen at sea?"
The patrons exchange uncomfortable looks.
"Not missing exactly," Marten says slowly. "But there's been... sleepwalking. 
Four people in the last few nights, all trying to head toward the water. Families 
been locking doors at night to keep them in."
What do you do?
We ran into something similar to this a while back. Have there been any new 
visitors passing through or other strange things that popped up before this 
week?
Dec 8
Aldric shakes his head. "No travelers to speak of. You're the first we've seen 
in... what, two weeks? And that was just a merchant passing through to the 
next town up the coast."
But old Tam is frowning, stroking his weathered chin. "Wait now. Wasn't 
exactly a visitor, but... you remember young Petra? Fischer's daughter? She 
found something on the beach, must be... ten days ago now? Maybe twelve?"
"What did she find?" Kessa asks, her tone sharp with interest.
"Some kind of trinket, I think. Pretty thing, from what I heard. She was 
showing it around the market that day, all excited." Tam looks to the other 
patrons. "Anyone remember what it looked like?"
One of the women at a corner table speaks up, her voice hesitant. "I saw it. A 
necklace or pendant, maybe? Had a green stone in it, and the metalwork was 
strange - not like anything our smithy makes. Looked old."
Marten nods slowly. "That's right. Petra was wearing it around her neck for 
days. Said it was the prettiest thing she'd ever owned."
Aldric's expression has gone grim. "Petra was one of the sleepwalkers. Night 
before last. Her father caught her at the door, trying to get out. She was still 
wearing that pendant."
A heavy silence falls over the room.
Brother Cyril exchanges a look with you. "Where is Petra now?"
"Home with her family," Aldric says. "The Fischers live on the east side of 
town, near the old smokehouse."
What do you do?
Would one of you be willing to make us an introduction?
Dec 8
Marten sets his mug down with a decisive thunk. "I'll take you. Fischer's a 
good man - his daughter married my cousin. He'll talk to you if I vouch for 
you."
He grabs a worn cloak from a peg by the door. "Better we go now, while there's 
still light. Nobody in this town likes being out after dark anymore."
Aldric nods approvingly. "I'll have those rooms ready and stew waiting when 
you get back. On the house, if you can actually help us."
As Marten leads you toward the door, Tam calls out: "One more thing you 
should know. The sleepwalkers? They don't remember any of it come 
morning. Not a thing. And Petra... she's been different since her father 
stopped her. Quiet. Won't hardly eat. Just sits and stares out the window 
toward the water."
Kessa glances at you, concern flickering across her features. Brother Cyril's 
hand rests on his holy symbol.
Marten pulls open the door, letting in the late afternoon light. "Come on then. 
Fischer's house is just a few minutes' walk."
Outside, the street is even quieter than before. You notice curtains twitching in 
windows as you pass - people watching, but not coming out.
Do you follow Marten, or do something else first?
Follow Marten
Dec 8
Marten leads you through the narrow streets of the town, his boots crunching 
on the packed earth. The houses here are smaller, more weathered - working 
people's homes. You pass a woman hurrying in the opposite direction who 
gives Marten a quick nod but doesn't slow down.
"That's the third house on the left," Marten says, pointing ahead to a single-
story cottage with faded blue shutters. Fishing nets hang from pegs on the 
exterior wall, and there's a small vegetable garden beside it, though it looks 
neglected. "Fischer's a net-maker. Good at his trade, but..."
He trails off as you approach the door. Before Marten can knock, it opens. A 
man in his forties stands there - thin, with dark circles under his eyes and 
several days' growth of beard. He looks like he hasn't slept properly in days.
"Marten," Fischer says, his voice hoarse. Then his gaze moves to you, Kessa, 
and Cyril. His expression becomes wary. "Who are these people?"
"Travelers from Haven," Marten says. "They're here to help, Ren. They've dealt 
with... strange things before. I think you should talk to them."
Fischer's jaw tightens. He looks back over his shoulder into the dim interior of 
the house, then steps outside, pulling the door mostly closed behind him. 
"She's sleeping," he says quietly. "Finally sleeping. First time in two days she's 
managed more than an hour."
His hands are trembling slightly.
"The pendant," Brother Cyril says gently. "The one your daughter found. Do 
you still have it?"
Fischer's eyes widen slightly. "How did you...?" He shakes his head. "Yes. I 
took it off her after... after that night. She fought me like a wild thing, but I got 
it off. I threw it in the sea."
Kessa goes very still. "You threw it back in the water?"
"What else was I supposed to do with it?" Fischer's voice rises, then he catches 
himself, glancing at the door. More quietly: "It was cursed, or haunted, or... I 
don't know what. But after I took it from her, she collapsed. Hasn't been right 
since."
What do you do?
We won't wake her, but can we see her?
Dec 8
Fischer hesitates, conflict clear on his face. Finally he nods. "Alright. But 
quietly. And don't... don't ask her questions. She won't answer anyway."
He opens the door and gestures you inside. The cottage is simple but well-kept 
- a main room with a hearth, a small kitchen area, and two doors leading to 
what must be bedrooms. The air inside is stale, like the windows haven't been 
opened in days.
Fischer leads you to one of the bedroom doors and eases it open. Inside, a girl 
of perhaps sixteen lies on a narrow bed, covered with a quilt. Her face is pale, 
almost waxy in the dim light filtering through a crack in the shutters. Her eyes 
are open, staring at the ceiling, unblinking.
"Petra," Fischer says softly. "There are some people here. They just want to 
look at you, make sure you're alright."
The girl doesn't react. Doesn't even seem to register that anyone has spoken. 
Her breathing is slow and steady, but her eyes... there's something deeply 
wrong about how empty they are.
Kessa takes a sharp breath. Brother Cyril moves closer, his expression grave. 
He murmurs a prayer under his breath and makes a subtle gesture - you 
recognize it as a minor divination, checking for magical influence.
His face darkens. He looks at you and gives a slight nod. Magic. Active.
Fischer watches anxiously from the doorway. "Is she... can you help her?"
What do you do?
Can you give us some more time to check to see if there is antic we can do for 
her?
Dec 8
Fischer nods quickly. "Yes, of course. Take whatever time you need. I'll... I'll be 
in the other room if you need me."
He retreats, pulling the door mostly closed but not latching it. You hear him 
settle into a chair in the main room, the wood creaking under his weight.
Brother Cyril kneels beside the bed, his hand hovering over Petra without 
quite touching her. He closes his eyes, concentrating. "There's definitely 
enchantment magic at work. Something binding her will, pulling her attention 
elsewhere." He opens his eyes, studying her face. "It's like part of her is still... 
reaching for something."
Kessa circles the bed slowly, examining Petra from different angles. "Look at 
her neck," she whispers.
You move closer. Where the pendant would have rested against Petra's skin, 
there's a faint mark - not quite a bruise, more like a discoloration. It has an 
odd shimmer to it, almost like mother-of-pearl.
"The pendant left a trace," Cyril says grimly. "Even though it's gone, the 
connection remains." He looks up at you. "I could attempt Lesser Restoration. 
It might break the enchantment, or at least weaken it enough for her to fight 
free. But if the source of the magic is still active..." He trails off meaningfully.
What do you do?
Try it. There isn't likely anyone else in town who could offer similar assistance.
Dec 8
Brother Cyril nods and moves to place both hands gently on Petra's forehead. 
He begins to pray, his voice low and steady, invoking his deity's power to 
purge harmful magic and restore wholeness.
Divine light emanates from his palms, soft and golden, washing over Petra's 
still form. For a moment, nothing happens-
Then she gasps, a sharp inhalation like someone breaking the surface after 
nearly drowning. Her back arches slightly off the bed, and the shimmer on her 
neck flares brightly before fading to almost nothing.
Her eyes blink. Once. Twice. They focus on Cyril's face above her, then dart 
around wildly, taking in you, Kessa, the room. Confusion and fear war in her 
expression.
"What-where-" Her voice is raspy from disuse.
The door bursts open. Fischer rushes in, nearly stumbling. "Petra? Petra!"
She turns her head toward her father's voice. "Da?" Tears start streaming 
down her face. "Da, I... something was pulling at me. In my head. I couldn't... I 
couldn't stop it."
Fischer drops to his knees beside the bed, taking her hand. "You're back. Gods, 
you're back." He's weeping openly now.
Brother Cyril stands slowly, his expression relieved but still concerned. He 
catches your eye and gestures subtly toward the door-we should give them a 
moment, but we need to talk.
Kessa is already moving toward the main room.
What do you do?
Follow them. Any ideas what that was?
Dec 8
You step into the main room with Cyril and Kessa, leaving Fischer and his 
daughter to their reunion. Cyril keeps his voice low.
"The enchantment was strong, but not complete-like she was being... 
prepared. Conditioned." He frowns deeply. "The pendant was a focus, 
certainly, but the magic felt older than that. Like the pendant was just a key to 
something that was already there, waiting."
Kessa leans against the wall, arms crossed. "And Fischer threw it back in the 
ocean. Which means it's either sitting on the sea floor somewhere, or..." She 
doesn't finish the thought.
"Or someone-or something-has already retrieved it," you finish for her.
Marten, who's been waiting near the door, speaks up quietly. "There were four 
sleepwalkers. Petra was one. Do you think... do the others have something 
similar? Something they found or were given?"
That's a good question.
From the bedroom, you hear Petra's voice, still weak but gaining strength. 
"The singing... I can still almost hear it. Like it's calling from far away. It 
wants... it wants us to come to the water. To bring..." She pauses. "To bring 
gifts? I don't understand."
Fischer's voice, soothing her: "Don't think about it now. You're safe."
Brother Cyril meets your gaze. "We need to find out about the other 
sleepwalkers. And we need to know more about what's out there in the water."
What do you do?
Tell Fisher Petra should be okay, but she'll need constant supervision until we 
can resolve what's behind all this.
Dec 8
You step back into the bedroom doorway. Fischer looks up at you, still holding 
his daughter's hand like he's afraid to let go.
"She should recover," you tell him, "but you need to keep close watch on her 
until we can deal with the source of this. The enchantment is broken, but 
whatever was calling to her is still out there."
Fischer nods emphatically. "I won't let her out of my sight. I swear it."
Petra turns her pale face toward you. "The others," she says, her voice stronger 
now. "Mara, old Willem, and... and Jens the cooper's son. They're still..." She 
swallows hard. "You have to help them. It's in their heads too. The singing. 
The pull toward the water."
"Did any of them find something like you did?" Kessa asks gently. "A trinket, 
jewelry, anything unusual?"
Petra's brow furrows as she thinks. "I... I don't know about Willem. But 
Mara-she's a weaver-she was excited about some shells she found. Beautiful 
ones, she said. Iridescent. She was going to string them for decoration." She 
pauses. "And Jens... Jens found an old coin, I think? He showed it to people at 
the market, said it had strange markings on it."
Fischer looks alarmed. "They're all still wearing these things?"
"I don't know," Petra whispers. "Maybe?"
You step back into the main room. Marten is waiting, having heard everything 
through the thin walls.
"I know where all three of them live," he says. "We should move quickly. It'll 
be dark soon."
What do you do?
Follow him
Dec 8
Marten leads you back out into the street. The sun is lower now, casting long 
shadows between the buildings. The temperature has dropped noticeably, and 
the wind carries a damp chill from the sea.
"Mara's closest," Marten says, setting a brisk pace. "She lives above her 
weaving shop, just past the market square."
You follow him through the winding streets. The town feels even more 
deserted now-shutters closed, doors barred. You catch glimpses of faces 
peering out from windows, quickly withdrawing when they see you looking.
The weaving shop is a narrow building with faded paint. A wooden sign hangs 
above the door showing a loom and spindle. Marten knocks firmly.
No answer.
He knocks again, harder. "Mara! It's Marten. I've got people here who can 
help."
Still nothing. Marten tries the door-it's locked.
"That's not right," he mutters. "Mara never locks her door during daylight 
hours. She's always working, always has customers coming and going."
Kessa moves to one of the shuttered windows, pressing her ear against it. After 
a moment, she shakes her head. "I don't hear anything inside. No loom 
working, no movement."
Brother Cyril frowns. "Could she be out? Visiting someone?"
Marten looks doubtful. "After what's been happening? Nobody's been going 
out unless they have to."
What do you do?
Find some way inside, even if it means breaking in
Dec 8
Kessa is already pulling out her lockpicks. "Allow me. Breaking down doors 
attracts attention we might not want."
She kneels by the lock, tools working deftly. Within thirty seconds there's a 
soft click. She glances up at Marten. "You're a witness that we're doing this to 
help, yes?"
"Aye," Marten says grimly. "Go on."
Kessa pushes the door open slowly. The interior is dim-shutters closed, no 
lamps lit. Your eyes adjust to reveal a front room filled with a large loom, 
shelves of thread and yarn, bolts of fabric. Everything is neat and organized, 
but there's a layer of dust on the loom that suggests it hasn't been used in 
days.
"Mara?" Marten calls out. "Are you here?"
No response.
A narrow staircase leads up to what must be her living quarters. Brother Cyril 
moves toward it, hand on his mace. You follow, with Kessa and Marten 
behind.
The stairs creak under your weight. At the top is a single room-bed, small 
table, wardrobe, washbasin. The bed is unmade, blankets trailing onto the 
floor.
And the window-the shutters here are open. Wide open, facing the sea.
Marten curses softly. "She's gone. She must have..." He moves to the window, 
looking out. "This faces the harbor. She could have climbed down and-"
"Look," Kessa says sharply. She's pointing at the small table beside the bed.
A string of shells lies there, gleaming with an unnatural iridescence even in the 
dim light. They seem to pulse faintly, like they're breathing.
What do you do?
Arcana check, any other investigative tracks to discern what these might be?
Dec 8
I'll roll for your Arcana check to examine the shells.
Rolls d20 + your Intelligence modifier and proficiency: 16 + 5 = 21
You move closer to examine the shells, careful not to touch them. Even from a 
foot away, you can sense the magic radiating from them-it makes your skin 
prickle, and there's a faint pressure behind your eyes, like the beginning of a 
headache.
The shells themselves are beautiful in an unsettling way. They're spiral-
shaped, each about the size of your thumb, and their iridescence shifts 
between deep blues, greens, and purples. But it's not just reflected light-the 
colors seem to move within the shells, swirling in patterns that almost resolve 
into shapes before breaking apart again.
Your arcane training tells you several things:
First, this is definitely enchantment magic, similar to what was affecting Petra 
but stronger. The shells are actively radiating a compulsion effect-anyone 
who wears them or keeps them close would be susceptible to outside 
influence.
Second, the magic isn't in the shells exactly-they're more like... receivers. 
Amplifiers. Something is broadcasting, and these items are tuned to pick up 
that signal and transmit it directly into the wearer's mind.
Third, and most disturbing: the magic has an aquatic signature you recognize 
from your studies. This kind of enchantment is associated with certain 
intelligent sea-dwelling creatures. Beings that use charm and domination to 
lure victims.
Brother Cyril watches you examine them. "What do you see?"
What do you tell them, and what do you do?
Everything. Assume moving forward, I share all information and insights with 
both Kessa and Cyril unless I specifically say otherwise. We need to get to the 
other two homes immediately.
Dec 8
You quickly explain your findings as Kessa wraps the shells in a piece of cloth 
from the shop, careful not to touch them directly. "Intelligent sea creatures 
using charm magic," she mutters. "Of course it couldn't just be cursed 
driftwood."
"The question is whether Mara left recently or hours ago," Brother Cyril says, 
heading for the stairs. "And if the other two are already gone as well."
Marten is already halfway down the stairs. "Jens lives near the docks-the 
cooper's workshop. Willem's cottage is on the north edge of town. Which 
first?"
"Jens," you say. "If he's closer to the water, he's in more immediate danger."
You exit the weaving shop at a run. The sun is touching the horizon now, 
painting the sky in shades of orange and red. Shadows stretch long across the 
streets.
The cooper's workshop is a sturdy building near the harbor, the smell of wood 
shavings and barrel pitch strong even from outside. Unlike Mara's shop, the 
door here stands slightly ajar.
Marten slows, suddenly wary. "That's not good."
You approach cautiously. Through the gap in the door, you can see the 
workshop interior-tools on benches, half-finished barrels, wood shavings 
scattered across the floor. And beyond, the back door also stands open, 
leading directly toward the beach.
Kessa draws a dagger, moving silently to peer inside. She looks back at you 
and shakes her head-empty.
From somewhere toward the water, you hear a sound. Singing. Faint but 
definitely there, rising and falling like waves. It's beautiful and deeply wrong 
at the same time.
What do you do?
Check the other home first.
Dec 8
"The other one first," you say sharply. "We need to know if all three are gone."
Marten nods and leads you at a sprint through the darkening streets toward 
the north edge of town. The singing fades behind you, but you can still feel it 
somehow-a pressure at the edge of your awareness.
Willem's cottage is small and isolated, set back from the other buildings with a 
clear view of the rocky coastline. As you approach, you can see the door is 
closed, a lamp burning in the window.
Marten pounds on the door. "Willem! Willem, open up!"
There's movement inside, then the sound of a bolt being drawn. The door 
opens to reveal an elderly man, gaunt and hollow-eyed. He's holding an iron 
poker from his fireplace like a weapon.
"Marten?" His voice is hoarse. "What are you doing here? It's nearly dark-you 
shouldn't be out when it's nearly dark."
"Are you alright?" Marten asks. "You haven't... gone walking?"
Willem shakes his head emphatically. "I threw the damned thing in my well 
two days ago. Dropped stones on top of it. I can still hear it sometimes, calling 
from down there, but I haven't..." He swallows hard. "I haven't gone to it. Been 
tying myself to the bed at night."
His hands are trembling. He looks like he hasn't slept in days.
Brother Cyril steps forward. "What did you find? What did you throw in the 
well?"
"A mask," Willem whispers. "Carved from shell or bone, I couldn't tell. 
Beautiful work. Found it washed up on the rocks. I wore it once, just to see..." 
His eyes go distant. "They spoke to me. Showed me things. Promised me 
things."
What do you do?
We need to see that mask; I'll use rope of entanglement to fish it out of the 
well.
Dec 8
Willem's eyes widen. "You want to... no. No, it needs to stay down there. 
Buried."
"We need to understand what we're dealing with," you say firmly. "And we 
need to break its hold on you completely, the way we did for Petra Fischer."
At Petra's name, Willem's resistance wavers. "She's... she's alright?"
"She is," Brother Cyril confirms. "But two others are already gone to the water. 
We need to act quickly."
Willem slumps, exhausted. "The well's out back. But I'm telling you-the 
moment that thing comes up, you'll feel it. It's worse than the shells or coins or 
whatever else washed up. Much worse."
He leads you around the cottage to a stone well, its opening covered with a 
heavy wooden lid weighed down with rocks. You can hear water far below.
You pull out your rope of entanglement and remove the lid. The well shaft 
descends into darkness, but you can see the glimmer of water perhaps thirty 
feet down.
As you lower the rope, you feel it-a pull at your mind, subtle but insistent. 
Like someone whispering just below the threshold of hearing.
The rope touches water. You will it to search, to find and grasp. After a 
moment, you feel resistance-it's found something.
You pull the rope up slowly. The whispering grows louder in your mind, not 
words exactly, but meaning. Promises of power, knowledge, belonging...
The mask breaks the surface of the well. Even in the fading light, it's 
beautiful-carved from some kind of pale material that seems to glow faintly. 
The features are angular, almost fish-like, with empty eye sockets that seem 
impossibly deep.
Kessa takes a sharp step back. "Gods, I can feel it from here."
What do you do?
What about my ring of mind protecting?
Dec 8
Good thinking. Your Ring of Mind Shielding should protect you from the 
mask's enchantment effects while you handle it.
You focus on the ring, feeling its protective magic activate-a cool, clear 
barrier that settles over your thoughts. The whispering immediately mutes, 
becoming distant and muffled, like voices heard through thick walls.
With the protection in place, you carefully lift the mask from the rope. Up 
close, you can see intricate carvings covering its surface-symbols and 
patterns that hurt to look at directly, seeming to shift and writhe. The material 
is definitely organic, perhaps carved from some massive sea creature's bone.
Willem has backed away to the cottage wall, his hands over his ears even 
though the sound isn't audible. "Get it away from me. Please."
Kessa has her eyes averted. "How bad is it?"
"Strong," you say, examining it closely. "Similar magic to the shells and the 
coin, but this is a much more powerful focus. This wasn't just found 
randomly-this was placed for someone to find."
Brother Cyril keeps his holy symbol raised, using it as a ward. "Can you tell 
what it does beyond the compulsion?"
With the ring protecting you, you can study the enchantment more clearly. 
The mask doesn't just receive-it connects. Someone wearing this wouldn't 
just be compelled; they'd be in direct communion with whatever is sending 
these signals. A two-way channel.
"It's a communication device," you say. "Whoever wears this doesn't just hear 
the call-they can be spoken to directly. Controlled."
What do you do with the mask?
Suggestions, Cyril or Kessa?
Dec 8
Kessa grimaces. "Destroy it? Smash it, burn it, whatever works? Last thing we 
need is someone else finding it."
Brother Cyril shakes his head slowly. "Destroying it might alert whatever's out 
there that we're interfering. And we still don't know exactly what we're dealing 
with-only that it's intelligent, uses enchantment magic, and has already 
claimed at least two people tonight." He pauses, thinking. "The mask is the 
most powerful focus we've found. If we could use it safely, it might tell us more 
about what we're facing. Or where Mara and Jens have been taken."
"Use it? Are you mad?" Kessa asks sharply.
"Johannes has the ring," Cyril points out. "He could put it on with protection 
in place. See what it shows him without being compromised."
"Could being the operative word," Kessa says. "We don't know how strong the 
magic is. What if the ring isn't enough?"
Cyril concedes the point with a nod. "Fair. The safer option is to secure it-
wrap it in blessed cloth, keep it somewhere it can't affect anyone, and use it as 
evidence of what's happening if we need to convince the town council to act."
Willem is still pressed against his cottage wall. "Whatever you're going to do, 
decide quickly. That singing from the beach-it's getting louder. They come 
out of the water when it's full dark. I've seen them."
What do you do?
Give the mask to Cyril for storage, then head to the beach. Kessa is half elven 
so she has benefits against charm. If needed, Cyril should stay with Wilhem 
and Martens.
Dec 8
You hand the mask to Brother Cyril, who wraps it carefully in a piece of 
blessed cloth from his pack, murmuring a prayer of warding as he does so. The 
whispers emanating from it diminish immediately.
"Marten, stay here with Willem," you say. "Make sure he's secure. Cyril, your 
call-stay and help them, or come with us?"
Cyril looks torn for a moment, then nods firmly. "I'm coming. If Mara and 
Jens are down there, they'll need healing or divine intervention to break free. 
And if there's combat..." He hefts his mace meaningfully.
"Fair enough," Kessa says, already moving toward the path that leads down to 
the beach. "Let's go see what's singing."
Marten grabs Willem's shoulder. "We'll bar the door. Be careful-whatever you 
saw that night, Willem, tell them."
Willem's voice is barely a whisper. "They walked like men, but they weren't. 
The moonlight showed... scales. Gills. Weapons made of coral and bone." He 
meets your eyes. "And they were looking at the houses. Like they were 
choosing."
You, Kessa, and Cyril head down the narrow path toward the beach. The 
singing is clearer now-multiple voices in an eerie harmony, the words in no 
language you recognize. The sun has fully set, and the moon is rising over the 
water, painting everything in silver light.
As you crest the final rise, the beach comes into view below.
Roll Perception for me (d20 + your Wisdom modifier + proficiency)
Roll
Dec 8
Rolls d20 + 3 (Wisdom modifier) + 3 (proficiency) = d20 + 6
Result: 14 + 6 = 20
Your eyes quickly adjust to the moonlit scene below, and what you see makes 
you freeze.
The beach stretches out in a crescent of pale sand. Three figures stand at the 
waterline-two adults and what looks like a young man. Even from this 
distance, you recognize the postures: vacant, entranced. Mara and Jens, 
almost certainly, and a third you don't recognize. They're wading slowly into 
the surf, knee-deep already.
But it's what's waiting for them in the water that commands your attention.
A dozen shapes rise from the waves. At first glance they might be human-they 
have the right number of limbs, stand upright-but the moonlight reveals the 
truth. Scaled skin that gleams green and blue, webbed hands holding weapons 
of sharpened coral and bone, gills that flutter at their necks. Their faces are 
somewhere between human and fish, with wide mouths full of needle teeth.
Sahuagin. Your studies told you of them-savage aquatic raiders who serve 
darker powers and view land-dwellers as either slaves or food.
One of them is larger than the rest, wearing what appears to be armor made 
from shells and carrying a trident that pulses with sickly green light. A 
priestess or champion, perhaps. She's the one leading the singing, her voice 
carrying an otherworldly power.
The three enchanted townsfolk are almost waist-deep now. In moments, 
they'll be within reach of the sahuagin.
Kessa has gone pale beside you. "There's too many of them."
Brother Cyril grips his holy symbol. "We have to try."
What do you do?
Maddening Hex and EB at priestess.
Dec 8
You step forward, raising your hand as eldritch power gathers around you. 
You invoke your patron's dark gift, casting Hex on the priestess and 
channeling the maddening whispers through it.
Rolling attack for Eldritch Blast (2 beams at 7th level): Beam 1: d20 + 6 
(Charisma + proficiency) = 19 + 6 = 25 - HIT Beam 2: d20 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17 - 
HIT
Damage for Beam 1: d10 + 4 (Charisma) = 7 + 4 = 11 force damage, plus d6 
Hex = 4 necrotic = 15 total Damage for Beam 2: d10 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 force 
damage, plus d6 Hex = 2 necrotic = 14 total Total: 29 damage
The twin bolts of crackling eldritch energy streak across the beach and slam 
into the priestess. She shrieks-a sound that's part rage, part pain-and 
staggers backward in the surf. The singing cuts off abruptly.
The maddening whispers of your Hex take hold. She clutches at her head with 
one webbed hand, her trident wavering.
The effect is immediate. The three entranced villagers stop their advance, 
confusion washing over their faces as the compulsion falters.
But the sahuagin are already reacting. The priestess snarls something in a 
gurgling, hissing language, and six of the warriors surge forward through the 
water toward the beach-and toward you on the ridge above.
The remaining sahuagin move to grab the disoriented villagers.
Rolling initiative: Johannes: d20 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18 Kessa: d20 + 4 = 14 + 4 = 
18 Cyril: d20 + 1 = 9 + 1 = 10 Sahuagin: d20 + 1 = 13 + 1 = 14
Initiative order: Johannes (18), Kessa (18), Sahuagin (14), Cyril 
(10)
Kessa has her bow out in a flash. "Six coming at us, more grabbing the 
townsfolk-what's the play?"
Your turn-what do you do?
Repeat against priestess, leave the others to kessa and cyril
Dec 8
You focus on the priestess again, channeling more eldritch power. The Hex is 
already in place, the maddening whispers clawing at her mind.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks: Beam 1: d20 + 6 = 8 + 6 = 14 Beam 2: d20 + 6 
= 17 + 6 = 23
The priestess is partially submerged and disoriented, but she's recovering 
quickly.
Her AC is 14 (natural armor + shield)
Beam 1: 14 - HIT (barely) Beam 2: 23 - HIT
Damage for Beam 1: d10 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 force, plus d6 Hex = 5 necrotic = 12 
total Damage for Beam 2: d10 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 force, plus d6 Hex = 3 necrotic 
= 16 total Total: 28 damage
Both beams strike true. The priestess screams again, her scaled flesh scorched 
and smoking. She's clearly hurt now, blood darkening the water around her. 
She raises her trident defensively, backing deeper into the surf.
Kessa's turn:
Kessa looses two arrows in rapid succession at the charging sahuagin.
Attack 1: d20 + 6 = 19 + 6 = 25 - HIT Attack 2: d20 + 6 = 4 + 6 = 10 - MISS
Damage: d8 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9, plus Sneak Attack (3d6) = 11 = 20 damage
Her first arrow takes one of the charging warriors in the throat. It gurgles and 
collapses into the surf. The second arrow goes wide.
"Five left!" she shouts.
Sahuagin turn:
The five remaining warriors continue their charge up the beach toward your 
position. They're fast-faster than you'd expect on land.
They use their movement to close distance but can't quite reach you yet-
they're about 40 feet away now
Behind them, three sahuagin have grabbed Mara, Jens, and the third villager. 
They're dragging them deeper into the water.
The priestess, wounded and furious, begins casting-her trident glowing 
brighter.
Cyril's turn:
"The villagers!" Cyril shouts. He raises his holy symbol high. "By the light that 
banishes darkness-TURN!"
Turn Undead doesn't work on sahuagin, but...
He's using Command instead as a bonus action on the nearest sahuagin 
dragging a villager: "RELEASE!"
Wisdom save for sahuagin: d20 + 0 = 8 - FAIL
The sahuagin holding Jens jerks as if struck, its hands opening involuntarily. 
Jens splashes free into the shallow water.
Round 2 - Your turn. What do you do?
Try to finish off the priestess before she can use magic.
Dec 8
You pour more eldritch energy into your assault, determined to take down the 
priestess before she can complete whatever spell she's weaving.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks: Beam 1: d20 + 6 = 15 + 6 = 21 - HIT Beam 2: 
d20 + 6 = 3 + 6 = 9 - MISS
Damage for Beam 1: d10 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 force, plus d6 Hex = 4 necrotic = 14 
total
The first beam strikes her squarely in the chest. She staggers, the glow from 
her trident flickering. The second beam goes wide, hissing harmlessly into the 
surf.
She's badly wounded-bleeding from multiple scorched wounds, barely 
staying upright-but still conscious. With a defiant snarl, she completes her 
spell.
Green energy erupts from her trident, spreading across the water in a wave. 
The three sahuagin still holding villagers suddenly move with renewed vigor, 
and two more sahuagin emerge from deeper water-reinforcements answering 
her call.
She cast a summoning or rallying spell - 2 additional sahuagin warriors 
arrive
Kessa's turn:
"Damn it, more of them!" Kessa shifts her aim, targeting the five warriors that 
are nearly upon you now.
Attack 1: d20 + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 - HIT Attack 2: d20 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 18 - HIT
Damage 1: d8 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8, plus Sneak Attack 3d6 = 9 = 17 total Damage 
2: d8 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
Another warrior drops, an arrow through its eye. The second arrow catches 
another in the shoulder-wounded but still coming.
Sahuagin turn:
The four remaining charging warriors reach your position. They swarm up the 
ridge with horrifying speed.
Rolling attacks - they split their attacks: Two on Johannes, two on Kessa
vs Johannes AC 14: Attack 1: d20 + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19 - HIT Attack 2: d20 + 3 = 
7 + 3 = 10 - MISS
Damage: d6 + 1 (spear) = 4 + 1 = 5 piercing damage
A coral spear grazes your side-you take 5 damage.
vs Kessa AC 15: Attack 1: d20 + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14 - MISS Attack 2: d20 + 3 = 19 
+ 3 = 22 - HIT
Damage: d6 + 1 = 5 + 1 = 6 piercing
Kessa hisses as a spear catches her arm-6 damage.
Meanwhile, the sahuagin in the water are dragging Mara and the third villager 
deeper. Jens is floundering in the shallows, disoriented but free.
The wounded priestess begins retreating into deeper water, still clutching her 
trident.
Cyril's turn:
Cyril charges down toward the water's edge, holy symbol blazing. "Hold on!" 
he shouts to Jens, then casts Spiritual Weapon-a glowing mace appears 
above one of the sahuagin dragging Mara.
Attack: d20 + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20 - HIT Damage: d8 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 force 
damage
The spiritual mace crashes down, forcing the creature to release Mara.
Round 3 - Your turn. Four sahuagin warriors in melee with you 
and Kessa. The priestess is retreating. Two more dragging the third 
villager. What do you do?
Priestess
Dec 8
You grit your teeth against the pain from the spear wound and focus past the 
warriors swarming around you. The priestess is retreating into deeper water-
you can't let her escape to rally more forces.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks: Beam 1: d20 + 6 = 2 + 6 = 8 - MISS Beam 2: 
d20 + 6 = 16 + 6 = 22 - HIT
The first beam goes wide as a sahuagin warrior jostles you, but you steady 
yourself and the second beam streaks across the beach.
Damage: d10 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 force, plus d6 Hex = 5 necrotic = 19 total
The bolt strikes her in the back as she tries to dive beneath the waves. She 
convulses, the trident falling from her grasp, and then goes still-floating face-
down in the surf before sinking slowly beneath the dark water.
The effect on the remaining sahuagin is immediate. Without their leader's 
magic sustaining them, the two dragging the third villager hesitate, looking 
back toward where the priestess disappeared.
Kessa's turn:
Kessa dances back from her attackers, putting distance between herself and 
the warriors. She fires at the one you wounded earlier.
Attack 1: d20 + 6 = 20 + 6 = 26 - CRITICAL HIT Attack 2: d20 + 6 = 15 + 6 = 
21 - HIT
Crit damage: 2d8 + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14, plus 6d6 Sneak Attack = 19 = 33 
total Second attack: d8 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9
Her arrow punches clean through one warrior's skull, dropping it instantly. 
The second arrow buries itself in another's chest-it staggers but stays upright.
"Three on us!" she calls out.
Sahuagin turn:
The three warriors near you fight with desperate fury, but their coordination is 
breaking.
vs Johannes: Attack: d20 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 - MISS
vs Kessa: Attack 1: d20 + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16 - HIT Attack 2: d20 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7 - 
MISS
Damage on Kessa: d6 + 1 = 3 + 1 = 4 piercing
Kessa takes another hit-4 more damage. She's looking bloodied.
In the water, the two sahuagin holding the third villager suddenly release 
them and dive beneath the waves, fleeing. Mara and Jens are both floating in 
the shallows, coughing and disoriented but alive.
Cyril's turn:
Cyril moves his spiritual weapon to strike one of the warriors attacking you.
Attack: d20 + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 - HIT Damage: d8 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 force
The glowing mace crushes the creature's skull. It drops.
Then Cyril rushes into the surf toward Mara and Jens. "Get to shore! Now!"
Two sahuagin warriors remain, both fighting you and Kessa. What 
do you do?
Transfer Hex to the wounded saghuin then one beam for him, one for the 
other.
Dec 8
You shift your Hex to the wounded sahuagin, the maddening whispers 
latching onto its mind as you split your fire between the two remaining 
warriors.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks: Beam 1 (at wounded sahuagin with Hex): d20 
+ 6 = 13 + 6 = 19 - HIT Beam 2 (at unwounded sahuagin): d20 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 
17 - HIT
Damage for Beam 1: d10 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 force, plus d6 Hex = 6 necrotic = 15 
total Damage for Beam 2: d10 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 force
The wounded sahuagin takes the full force of your blast combined with the 
Hex-it shrieks as the necrotic energy tears through it, collapsing into a 
twitching heap.
The second beam slams into the remaining warrior, scorching scales and flesh. 
It's badly hurt but still standing.
Kessa's turn:
Kessa doesn't waste the opportunity. Two quick shots at the last warrior.
Attack 1: d20 + 6 = 17 + 6 = 23 - HIT Attack 2: d20 + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15 - HIT
Damage 1: d8 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10, plus Sneak Attack 3d6 = 13 = 23 
total Damage 2: d8 + 3 = 4 + 3 = 7
Both arrows find their mark. The creature staggers, looks toward the water as 
if considering retreat, then collapses.
The beach falls suddenly, eerily quiet. Just the sound of waves and labored 
breathing.
Combat ended.
Cyril is in the shallows, helping Mara and Jens toward shore. The third 
villager-a middle-aged man you don't recognize-is stumbling out of the 
water on his own, coughing up seawater.
Kessa leans against a rock, pressing a hand to her wounded arm. "That was 
closer than I'd like," she mutters, then looks at you. "You alright?"
You've taken 5 damage. Kessa has taken 10 total.
The bodies of the sahuagin litter the beach. In the moonlight, you can see the 
priestess's trident half-buried in the sand where she dropped it, still 
emanating a faint green glow.
What do you do?
Pull all the bodies into shore so they can be examined and collect the trident.
Dec 8
You move down to the waterline, hauling the sahuagin bodies fully onto the 
sand. Kessa helps, grimacing with each movement of her injured arm. The 
corpses are heavy, their scaled bodies cold and slick.
Seven sahuagin warriors in total, plus you wade into the surf to retrieve the 
priestess's body. She's larger than the others, more powerfully built, with 
ritual scarring across her shoulders and chest. Around her neck hangs an 
amulet made of black coral shaped into a symbol you don't recognize-
something with too many angles, almost painful to look at directly.
You collect the trident carefully. Even without touching it, you can feel the 
magic thrumming through it. Dark magic, aligned with whatever entity these 
sahuagin served.
Arcana check to examine the trident: d20 + 5 = 11 + 5 = 16
The trident is a magic weapon, certainly, but it's also a focus for divine magic-
specifically, magic granted by some underwater deity or powerful entity. The 
green glow suggests necromantic or life-draining properties. This isn't 
something you'd want to use without understanding exactly what you'd be 
channeling.
Brother Cyril approaches, having gotten the three rescued villagers safely onto 
dry sand. All three are shivering, disoriented, but alive. Mara is weeping 
quietly. Jens just stares at the ocean with haunted eyes. The third man-you 
learn his name is Gareth-keeps muttering "the voices, the voices" over and 
over.
Cyril looks at the bodies, then at you. "We need to search them. Find out if 
there are more, where they came from, what they were planning."
Kessa crouches by the priestess's body, studying the amulet. "This symbol... 
Johannes, you recognize it?"
Do you examine the amulet more closely? Search the bodies? What 
do you do?
All the above, then pull back to Wilhelms house and short rest
Dec 8
You kneel beside the priestess, examining the amulet more closely. Your 
patron's knowledge stirs uneasily in your mind as you study the twisted 
symbol.
Religion/Arcana check: d20 + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
The symbol resolves in your understanding-this is a holy symbol of Sekolah, 
the Shark God, a savage deity of blood and predation worshipped by sahuagin. 
But there's something else layered beneath it, older and darker. Secondary 
runes suggest this particular priestess served a deeper power, something that 
dwells in the ocean trenches. An entity that hungers not just for flesh, but for 
thralls and servants.
You carefully remove the amulet and wrap it with the trident in cloth.
Searching the bodies reveals:
*	Crude weapons of sharpened coral and bone
*	Woven kelp pouches containing shells similar to the ones Mara wore 
(you collect these carefully)
*	A waterproof case on the priestess containing a scroll tube made of 
hollowed bone
Inside the tube is a map-crude but legible-showing the coastline with this 
village marked. But more disturbing: a sea cave about two miles north along 
the coast is circled repeatedly, with symbols indicating it leads to something 
underwater. Numbers beside it suggest... a count? Dozens, maybe more.
"There's a larger force," you say grimly. "This was just a raiding party."
Cyril helps the villagers to their feet. "We need to get everyone back to town. 
Secure. Then rest and plan."
The walk back is tense. You keep the bodies where they are-evidence the 
town council will need to see. By the time you reach Wilhelm's cottage, word 
has already spread. Marten emerges with Wilhelm, both looking shaken.
"You killed them," Wilhelm breathes, staring at your bloodied group. "You 
actually killed them."
Inside Wilhelm's cottage, you bar the door and windows. The three rescued 
villagers are taken to their families. Wilhelm provides what medical supplies 
he has-bandages, clean water.
Brother Cyril tends to Kessa's wounds first with a Cure Wounds.
Healing: d8 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 HP restored to Kessa
Then he moves to you.
Healing: d8 + 4 = 5 + 4 = 9 HP restored to Johannes (you're back to full)
"We should rest," Cyril says. "A short rest at minimum. You both need to 
recover, and we need to decide our next move."
You settle in for a short rest. The cottage is cramped but secure. Wilhelm and 
Marten keep watch while you, Kessa, and Cyril catch your breath.
Short rest - you can roll hit dice to recover HP if needed. You can also recover 
your warlock spell slots.
During the rest, what do you discuss? What's your plan?
What building in town is big enough to hold all the town members and 
defensible?
Dec 8
"What building in town could hold everyone and be defended?" you ask 
Wilhelm and Marten.
Wilhelm thinks for a moment. "The town hall, maybe? It's stone, two stories, 
has a cellar. Built solid when the town was founded."
Marten shakes his head. "Not big enough. Hundred people in this town, 
maybe more. Town hall holds fifty at most, and uncomfortably." He pauses. 
"The warehouse by the docks is bigger-could fit everyone-but it's just wood 
and right on the water. Worst place to be if more of those things come."
"What about the church?" Kessa asks.
"We don't have one," Wilhelm says. "Most folk here follow the old ways, make 
offerings to the sea. There's a shrine, but it's barely more than a covered 
pavilion."
Brother Cyril frowns. "The inn, then? The Whalebone?"
Wilhelm nods slowly. "Two stories, stone foundation, stout walls. Aldric built 
it to weather storms. Main common room is large, maybe holds sixty 
comfortably. Could pack more in if needed. Upper floor has rooms, and there's 
a good-sized cellar for storage."
"Still not enough for the whole town," you observe.
Marten rubs his jaw. "Could fortify multiple buildings. The inn, the town hall, 
maybe the cooper's workshop-it's solid construction. Spread people out but 
keep them secure."
"Or," Kessa says quietly, "we evacuate. Get everyone inland, away from the 
coast entirely, until this is dealt with."
Wilhelm's expression darkens. "This is our home. Our livelihoods. Everything 
we have is here."
"Everything you have doesn't matter if you're dead or enslaved," Kessa 
counters, not unkindly.
What's your thinking?
This is a strategic retreat. Leaving the town gives us the ability to focus on the 
sanghuin without having to worry about prescribed you all, to. You'd leave if 
you knew a typhoon was coming, wouldn't you?
Dec 8
Wilhelm's resistance wavers at that. He exchanges a long look with Marten, 
then nods slowly. "Aye. You're right. When the big storms come, we've 
evacuated before. Lost the catch, lost some buildings, but people survived."
Marten stands. "There's a larger town-Saltmere-about fifteen miles inland. 
They'd take us in. We've got family connections, trade relationships. It's where 
most folk go when the storms get bad."
"How long to evacuate everyone?" Brother Cyril asks practically.
"By morning, if we move fast," Marten says. "Most families keep emergency 
packs ready-old habit from storm season. Wagons, carts, whatever we've got. 
The elderly and children ride, everyone else walks."
Wilhelm looks out the shuttered window toward the invisible sea. "And then 
what? We just... abandon our homes to those things?"
"No," you say firmly. "You get to safety. We deal with the sahuagin. That map 
showed a cave two miles north-that's where their main force is. We eliminate 
the threat at its source, then you come back."
Kessa leans forward. "We need to start the evacuation now, tonight. Spread 
the word quietly, get people packing. By first light, everyone moves. Those 
things attacked after dark-they might not expect us to act this quickly."
"What about the bodies on the beach?" Marten asks. "And the trident, those 
cursed items?"
"We take evidence with us," Brother Cyril says. "The town council at Saltmere 
needs to know what happened here. As for the magical items..." He looks at 
you.
What do you want to do with the trident, amulet, cursed shells, and 
mask? And how do you want to handle organizing the evacuation?
Leave the town evacuation to the townsfolk. Maybe Cyrus (let's change his 
name) can bless the water in the well, then dump the items there to keep 
them out of trouble?
Dec 8
"Brother Cyrus," you say, turning to the cleric. "Could you bless the water in 
Wilhelm's well? Make it sanctified ground-or sanctified water, I suppose-
then we dump all the cursed items in there. Keeps them secure and 
contained."
Cyrus considers this, one hand on his holy symbol. "Yes, that should work. 
Consecrated water would suppress the enchantment magic, make the items 
inert without destroying them. If they need to be studied later or properly 
destroyed, they'd still be retrievable." He nods. "A good solution."
"And the town evacuation-Marten, Wilhelm, can you organize that? Spread 
the word, get people moving quietly? We trust you to handle it."
Marten straightens. "Aye. Wilhelm and I know every family in town. We'll 
start with the council members, get them on board, then spread out from 
there. Quiet and quick."
Wilhelm already has his coat on. "I'll start on the east side, you take west?"
"Done," Marten agrees. He looks at you three. "What about you? You're not 
coming with us to Saltmere?"
"We're going to that cave," Kessa says flatly. "Tonight, while they're not 
expecting it. Hit them before they can organize another raid."
Marten looks like he wants to argue, then just nods. "You're mad. But you 
saved three lives tonight, maybe the whole town. We'll get everyone out. You 
do what you need to do."
The two men head out into the night to begin the evacuation.
Cyrus goes to the well with his holy symbol and waterskin. He begins the ritual 
of consecration, his voice low and steady as divine light emanates from his 
hands into the well water below.
This takes about 10 minutes
When he finishes, you drop the items one by one into the sanctified depths: 
the mask, the shells, the amulet, and finally the trident. Each one hits the 
water with a splash, the magical resonance fading immediately as the blessed 
water suppresses their power.
Cyrus replaces the well cover and stacks the rocks back on top. "They'll be safe 
there until this is resolved."
You've completed your short rest. Your spell slots are restored.
"So," Kessa says, checking her weapons. "We're really doing this? Marching 
into a cave full of sahuagin in the middle of the night?"
What's your plan for approaching the cave?
We need to see if there is more gillyweed or some other means of protecting 
kessa and Cyrus from drowning. I have the cloak of the mantra. Then we go to 
the cave.
Dec 8
"We need a way to keep you two breathing underwater," you say. "I've got the 
Cloak of the Manta Ray, but that only helps me."
Cyrus thinks for a moment. "I can prepare Water Breathing tomorrow if we 
wait. It would let all three of us breathe underwater for 24 hours."
"Tomorrow might be too late," Kessa points out. "They could launch another 
raid tonight, or realize their priestess didn't return and fortify their position."
"True," you concede. "What about the town? Any alchemists, herbalists, 
someone who might have potions or materials?"
Cyrus shakes his head. "This is a fishing village. They're practical folk-nets 
and boats, not potions and magic."
Kessa drums her fingers on her bow. "The map showed the cave entrance 
above water, right? We might not need underwater breathing immediately. 
We can scout the entrance, see what we're dealing with. If it leads underwater, 
we pull back and wait for Cyrus to prepare the spell."
She has a point. The map indicated the cave entrance was accessible from the 
shore, even if it led to something beneath the waves.
"We take it carefully," Cyrus suggests. "Reconnaissance first. If we can strike 
without going underwater, we do. If not, we retreat and come back prepared."
You consider the options. It's perhaps two hours until midnight. The town 
evacuation will take until dawn. The sahuagin could attack again at any time.
Do you:
1.	Head to the cave now for reconnaissance
2.	Wait until morning when Cyrus can prepare Water Breathing
3.	Search the town more thoroughly for supplies first
What do you do?
I'll leave kessa and Cyrus in town. Cyrus starts the ritual, Kessa searches for 
supplies. I'll scout since I have the best stealth options.
Dec 8
"I'll scout alone," you say. "I've got the best stealth capabilities, and with the 
cloak I can go underwater if needed. Cyrus, start your preparation ritual 
for Water Breathing. Kessa, search the town-alchemist, herbalist, anyone 
who might have useful supplies. We regroup at the inn in two hours."
Kessa doesn't look happy. "You're going alone into a cave full of those things?"
"I'm scouting, not fighting. If I see something we can't handle, I pull back." 
You meet her eyes. "We need information. How many, what the cave layout is, 
whether they're preparing another attack. I can move silently, turn invisible if 
needed. This is what I do."
Cyrus nods slowly. "Two hours. If you're not back by then..."
"Then assume the worst and get everyone to Saltmere." You check your 
equipment. "But I'll be back."
Kessa sighs. "Fine. But if you die doing something stupid, I'm keeping your 
share of any treasure we find."
A ghost of a smile crosses your face. "Fair enough."
 
You leave them in Wilhelm's cottage and head north along the coast road. The 
moon is bright, casting silver light across the landscape. You pass evacuating 
townspeople moving inland-families with children, elders on carts, everyone 
moving with quiet urgency.
The coastline grows rockier as you travel north. After about forty minutes of 
careful movement, you spot what must be the cave entrance-a dark opening 
in the cliff face where the rocks meet the water. The tide is low, leaving a 
narrow beach of stones and sand before the cave mouth.
You invoke your One with Shadows invocation, melding into the darkness as 
you approach.
Stealth check: d20 + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19
Silent as a ghost, you move closer. The cave entrance is perhaps fifteen feet 
wide, tall enough to walk upright. You can hear water lapping inside-the cave 
is partially flooded.
Do you enter the cave, or observe from outside first?
Investigate first.
Dec 8
You crouch in the shadows outside the cave entrance, taking time to observe 
before committing. The moonlight penetrates only a few feet into the opening 
before darkness swallows everything.
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
You note several things:
The cave floor is wet but not fully submerged at this tide level-there's a rocky 
path along one side that stays above the waterline. The water inside is dark 
and still, maybe two feet deep in the flooded section.
Marks in the sand and on the rocks-recent traffic. Webbed footprints, drag 
marks where something heavy was pulled into the cave. Dozens of prints, 
confirming what the map suggested: this is definitely their base.
You hear sounds from deeper in: the echo of water dripping, distant 
movement, and-faintly-that same singing you heard on the beach. Multiple 
voices, though quieter now. A hymn or chant, perhaps.
There's a faint smell of brine and rotting fish, stronger than the normal ocean 
scent.
No guards visible at the entrance, which strikes you as either overconfident or 
a sign they don't expect trouble. Or perhaps they rely on the darkness and 
water to warn them of intruders.
The cave curves to the right about thirty feet in, preventing you from seeing 
what lies beyond without entering.
Investigation check for tracks/signs: d20 + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16
Studying the footprints more carefully, you can distinguish at least three 
different sizes-warriors like the ones you fought, but also smaller prints 
(juveniles?) and those massive prints that must be from something much 
larger. Something the size of an ogre, maybe bigger.
Do you enter the cave to scout further, or have you seen enough?
I enter the mouth of the cave.
Dec 8
You step silently into the cave mouth, still cloaked in magical darkness from 
your invocation. The temperature drops noticeably, and the smell of brine 
intensifies. Your eyes adjust to the deeper gloom.
The rocky path along the left side of the cave stays mostly dry, though slick 
with moisture. You move carefully, placing each foot with precision to avoid 
any sound.
Stealth check: d20 + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24
You're practically a ghost. The cave curves right as you observed, and as you 
round the bend, the passage opens into a larger chamber.
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 7 + 3 = 10
The chamber is perhaps forty feet across. The water here is deeper-waist-high 
in the center-but the rocky ledge continues around the perimeter. 
Phosphorescent algae on the walls provides dim, eerie illumination in shades 
of blue-green.
You count six sahuagin in this chamber. Four warriors are sleeping or resting 
on rocky outcroppings above the waterline. Two others stand in the water 
itself, swaying slightly-they're the ones chanting. Some kind of ritual or 
prayer.
Beyond this chamber, the cave continues deeper. You can see two passages: 
one slopes downward into darkness and fully submerged water, the other 
continues roughly level, still partially flooded but navigable.
The chanting sahuagin haven't noticed you. The sleeping ones are motionless.
From the deeper passage, you hear more sounds-movement, voices, the 
clatter of what might be weapons or tools.
What do you do?
From this description, will water breathing be a likely need.?
Dec 8
Looking at what you've seen so far, water breathing would definitely be useful 
but might not be strictly necessary for at least the initial assault.
The cave system has:
*	A navigable dry/shallow path that you could fight along
*	One passage that goes fully underwater (likely where the main nest or 
deeper chambers are)
*	The main inhabited areas seem accessible without submersion
However, there are significant tactical considerations:
1.	The sahuagin's advantage: They can retreat into the flooded areas 
where you can't follow without water breathing. Any wounded or fleeing 
enemies would escape underwater.
2.	Unknown depth: That submerged passage likely leads to their main 
force, treasure, or leaders. Without water breathing, you can't pursue or 
fully clear the threat.
3.	The large creature: Those massive footprints suggest something big, 
and it's probably in the deeper, flooded sections.
Your assessment: You could launch a raid on the accessible areas now and 
likely kill or drive off the sahuagin you can reach. But without water breathing, 
you can't:
*	Pursue fleeing enemies
*	Access the deeper nest
*	Ensure you've eliminated the entire threat
*	Recover the missing boat crew (if they're still alive)
A surface raid might scatter them temporarily, but they'd regroup in the 
depths. Water breathing would let you finish this completely.
Do you continue scouting deeper, or head back with this 
intelligence?
Retreat. There's no point in trying to go deeper yet, at least not alone.
Dec 8
Smart call. You've gathered valuable intelligence-six sahuagin in this 
chamber, at least two passages deeper, and confirmation this is their base. 
Pushing further alone risks discovery and gains little.
You carefully retrace your steps, staying in the shadows and moving with the 
same silent precision.
Stealth check to exit: d20 + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20
You slip out of the cave undetected. The sahuagin continue their chanting, 
unaware they've been observed.
The walk back to town takes another forty minutes. As you approach, you can 
see the evacuation is well underway-a steady stream of people and carts 
moving inland along the road. Lanterns bob in the darkness like fireflies.
You find Kessa and Cyrus at the Whalebone Inn. Aldric is still there, 
organizing the last of the supplies. The common room has been stripped of 
anything valuable.
Kessa looks up as you enter, visible relief crossing her features. "You're back. 
And in one piece."
Cyrus sets down a book he was studying. "What did you find?"
You lay out what you saw: the cave layout, the six sahuagin in the first 
chamber, the two passages-one fully submerged, the evidence of something 
much larger.
"And?" Kessa asks. "Your assessment?"
How do you want to explain your tactical thinking to them?
I don't think I can get deeper in without being exposed, and we can't afford 
that without being able to press forward by strength of arms. What did Kessa 
find? Also, is there something Cyrus can use for protection against charming?
Dec 8
"I don't think I can get deeper without being exposed," you explain. "And we 
can't afford that without being able to press the attack. If they spot me alone, 
I'm retreating through narrow passages with sahuagin on all sides and more 
coming from the depths. We need to go in as a team, with water breathing, 
ready for a full assault-not a scouting mission."
Kessa nods. "Sensible. I was worried you'd try to be a hero."
"What did you find?" you ask her.
She grimaces. "Not much. This is a fishing village, not a mage's tower. I found 
some basic healing supplies-bandages, salves, nothing magical. Old Willem 
had some antitoxin he uses for jellyfish stings. Aldric gave me his entire stock 
of oil flasks-could be useful for fire if we need it." She pats her pack. "But no 
potions, no magic items, no gillyweed or anything like that."
"Better than nothing," you concede. You turn to Cyrus. "What about protection 
against charm effects? Can you prepare something for that?"
Cyrus considers. "I can prepare Protection from Evil and Good which would 
protect one person from aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and 
undead-including their charm effects. But sahuagin are humanoids, not any 
of those creature types, so it wouldn't help against them specifically."
He pauses. "However, I can prepare Calm Emotions which can suppress 
charm effects on multiple targets if needed. Or Lesser Restoration to break 
charm after the fact, as we did with Petra. My best option for prevention 
would be to give you both Bless before we engage-it would help you resist 
their magic along with improving your combat effectiveness."
Kessa's half-elven heritage gives her advantage on saves against charm 
already, and your Ring of Mind Shielding protects you.
"The real question," Cyrus says, "is timing. Do we strike at dawn after I've 
prepared spells, or wait until tomorrow night when they might launch another 
raid on an empty town?"
What's your plan?
What if, instead, we spend the day planting traps throughout the town for 
when they likely come, then sneak to the cave and raid it while they discover 
there's no one here?
Dec 8
You lay out the idea: "What if we spend tomorrow setting traps throughout the 
town-oil, tripwires, prepared ambush points. When the sahuagin come for 
their next raid tomorrow night, they find an empty town full of nasty 
surprises. While they're scattered and confused, dealing with traps, we hit the 
cave. Their raiding party is away, their defenses are depleted, and we strike the 
nest directly."
Kessa's eyes light up. "I like it. Classic misdirection. They think they're the 
hunters, but we flip it on them."
Cyrus strokes his chin thoughtfully. "It has merit. We'd need to make the town 
look inhabited enough to draw them in-lights in windows, maybe some 
movement-but abandoned enough that no one's actually at risk."
"We could rig lanterns on pulleys," Kessa suggests, warming to the idea. 
"Make it look like people are moving around inside buildings. String fishing 
line across doorways with bells or pots-anything that comes through makes 
noise and alerts us. And those oil flasks..." She grins. "A few well-placed fires 
could do serious damage in confined spaces."
"The timing would be critical," Cyrus warns. "We'd need to know when they're 
committed to the town raid before we hit the cave. If we go too early, they 
retreat and we're caught between two forces. Too late, and they're back at the 
cave before we finish."
Aldric, who's been listening while packing, speaks up. "They came just after 
full dark last time. Around two hours after sunset. If the pattern holds..."
Do you want to pursue this plan? And if so, how do you want to 
spend the day preparing?
Sounds God. The townsfolk know the town, those that are left can take the 
lead with the traps, with our assistance. Maybe two or three of them can stay 
on the outskirts and fire a flare when the sanguine have committed to their 
attack, then flee towards Saltmere, while we use the signal to launch our own 
attack. We might also spend the day looking to see if there are other entrance 
or exits to the cave in the daylight.
Dec 8
"Good," you say. "The townsfolk who remain can lead the trap-setting-they 
know the layout better than we do. We assist where needed. Then we position 
two or three volunteers on the outskirts with a signal flare. When the sahuagin 
commit to their attack, they fire the signal, then flee toward Saltmere. That's 
our cue to hit the cave."
Aldric nods slowly. "Marten and old Tam would volunteer for that, I'm sure. 
Both are steady hands. And Willem knows more about fires and demolition 
than anyone-built half the smokehouse ovens in town."
"We should also scout the cave area in daylight," you continue. "Look for other 
entrances or exits. The last thing we want is sahuagin fleeing out a back door 
we didn't know about, or reinforcements arriving from another direction."
Cyrus agrees. "A solid plan. We have today to prepare. I'll need the morning to 
prepare my spells-Water Breathing, Bless, Cure Wounds, Lesser 
Restoration in case of charm effects. That leaves the afternoon for scouting 
and final preparations."
Kessa stretches. "Right then. First things first-we all need actual sleep. A few 
hours at least. Can't fight on fumes."
Aldric gestures upstairs. "Rooms are still made up. Get some rest. I'll wake you 
at first light, and we'll gather whoever's staying to help with the traps."
The exhaustion hits you suddenly-the fight on the beach, the scouting 
mission, the planning. Your body is demanding rest.
Do you sleep here at the inn, or make other arrangements? And is 
there anything specific you want to do before resting?
Just sleep in the inn.
Dec 8
You head upstairs to one of the rooms. The bed is simple but clean, and after 
the day's events, it might as well be a palace. Kessa takes the room next door, 
Cyrus the one across the hall.
You remove your armor and weapons, setting them within easy reach, and 
collapse onto the bed. Sleep comes quickly.
 
Several hours pass
You wake to pale morning light filtering through the shutters and the smell of 
cooking fish. Your body feels considerably better-rested, wounds fully healed 
from Cyrus's magic yesterday.
Downstairs, Aldric has prepared a simple breakfast. Kessa is already eating, 
looking more alert. Cyrus sits at a corner table, his prayer book open before 
him, deep in concentration as he prepares his spells for the day.
Marten and Wilhelm are there as well, along with old Tam. A few other 
townspeople-perhaps six in total-sit at tables, clearly the volunteers who've 
stayed behind.
"Morning," Aldric says, setting a plate in front of you. "Most everyone else is 
halfway to Saltmere by now. These folks wanted to help. Figured you'd have a 
plan."
Marten looks determined. "This is our town. We're not running without a 
fight, even if it's just setting traps and lighting a signal fire."
Tam grunts agreement, sipping from a mug of strong tea.
It's now morning. Cyrus is preparing spells (this takes about an 
hour). What do you want to do first-organize the trap-setting, 
scout the cave area in daylight, or something else?
Trap setting, until Cyrus is done, then we'll leave the townsfolk to their work 
while we scout the shoreline, maybe with old Tam who knows the area, but it's 
smart enough to know to retreat in the face of trouble.
Dec 8
You spend the next hour working with the townspeople on trap preparation. 
Wilhelm proves invaluable-his knowledge of the buildings and where to place 
hazards is expert.
Together, you set up:
*	Oil traps in three key buildings near the water-the warehouse, 
cooper's shop, and a storage shed. Barrels positioned to spill and create 
fire zones when triggered
*	Tripwires across main approaches, connected to bells and pots that 
will clatter loudly
*	Lanterns on pulleys in several buildings to simulate movement and 
occupancy
*	Caltrops scattered in the sand near the beach-Wilhelm had boxes of 
them for some forgotten purpose
*	Collapsing shelving in the warehouse rigged to fall on intruders
Kessa helps with the more delicate mechanical work, while you advise on 
positioning based on what you saw of sahuagin tactics.
By the time Cyrus emerges from his meditations, the town is transformed into 
a maze of hazards.
"Nicely done," he says, surveying the work. "They'll think twice before raiding 
again."
You turn to old Tam. "We need to scout the shoreline around the cave. Look 
for other entrances, exits, approaches. You know these waters better than 
anyone-would you guide us? But if there's trouble, you retreat immediately."
Tam sets down his mug and stands with a creaking of old joints. "Aye. Been 
fishing these rocks for fifty years. I know every cave and crevice within five 
miles." He picks up a gnarled walking stick. "Let's go see what we're dealing 
with."
The four of you-you, Kessa, Cyrus, and Tam-head north along the coast road 
in full daylight.
The journey takes about forty minutes. The coastline here is rugged-black 
rocks jutting from the water, tide pools, narrow beaches of stone. Seabirds 
wheel overhead.
As you approach the area of the cave, Tam stops and points. "Main entrance is 
there, like you found. But see that outcropping?" He indicates a rocky 
promontory about a hundred yards further north. "Behind that, there's 
another opening. Smaller. Fills completely at high tide, but at low tide..." He 
squints at the water. "Low tide's in about three hours. You could get in that 
way if you wanted."
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12
You study the area. The rocks provide good cover for approach. The main 
entrance is visible from here-still dark and unwatched in the daylight.
"Any other ways in or out?" Kessa asks.
Tam thinks. "Not that I know of. But caves like this... they can have 
underwater passages. Connect to other cave systems, or open up into the sea 
proper. Without diving, hard to say."
What do you want to do? Continue scouting, try to observe the cave 
entrance, check out that secondary entrance, or head back to town?
Check out the small entrance
Dec 8
"Let's check the smaller entrance," you say. "See what we're working with."
Tam leads you along the rocky shoreline, picking his way with the confidence 
of decades of experience. The going is slow-tide pools, slippery rocks, narrow 
passages between stone formations-but after about fifteen minutes you reach 
the promontory.
Behind it, just as Tam described, is a cleft in the rock face. It's perhaps four 
feet wide, currently half-filled with seawater that sloshes in and out with the 
waves. The opening angles downward into darkness.
"At low tide, this'll be mostly clear," Tam says. "Water'll be ankle-deep, maybe. 
You could squeeze through single-file. Don't know where it goes-never had 
reason to crawl into sahuagin caves before today."
You crouch at the entrance, peering in. Unlike the main cave entrance with its 
wide, accessible path, this is tight-you'd have to crouch or crawl in places. But 
it's definitely navigable.
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 16 + 3 = 19
You notice water marks on the rocks showing the tide levels. Tam's right-at 
low tide this would be mostly passable. You also see scratches on the stone 
near the entrance. Recent ones. Something with claws has been moving 
through here.
The opening curves and descends. You can't see more than ten feet in without 
entering, but you hear the echo of dripping water and, very faintly, that same 
oceanic smell from the main entrance.
Cyrus kneels beside you. "A back door. Could be useful. We could split their 
attention-enter from both sides, trap them between us."
"Or it could split our forces," Kessa points out. "We're only three. Dividing up 
in unfamiliar caves full of hostiles seems risky."
"True," Cyrus concedes. "But knowing it exists is valuable. They might try to 
flee this way, or we might need an escape route ourselves."
Tam stays well back, keeping watch on the surrounding rocks. "Your call, but 
I'd not want to go in there even at low tide. Too easy to get trapped if the tide 
turns or something comes at you in those narrows."
What do you want to do? Try to scout this entrance further, head 
back to town, or something else?
Use the cloak of manta and enter the cave just to see how deep thewater is 
and how tight it gets.
Dec 8
"I'm going to check how far this goes," you say, pulling out the Cloak of the 
Manta Ray. "See if it's actually viable as an entrance or escape route."
"Johannes-" Kessa starts.
"Just a quick look. I'll be careful." You don the cloak, feeling its magic activate. 
Your body adapts immediately-you can breathe water as easily as air, and you 
feel instinctively how to move through it.
You wade into the cleft, the water rising to your waist, then chest as the 
passage slopes downward. The opening narrows quickly-you have to turn 
sideways to fit through in places, the rock scraping against your armor.
Stealth check (underwater): d20 + 6 = 7 + 6 = 13
You move carefully but the confined space makes perfect silence impossible. 
Your movements disturb the water, creating currents.
The passage descends about fifteen feet, then levels out. The water here is 
about five feet deep at current tide-at low tide it would be perhaps two feet, 
just as Tam estimated. You can touch bottom and walk, though crouched.
The tight section lasts maybe twenty feet, then opens into a small grotto. 
Phosphorescent algae provides dim light. The grotto is perhaps ten feet across, 
with the water only waist-deep even now.
Across the grotto, you see where this passage connects to the main cave 
system-a low opening, mostly submerged, that must lead to the chambers 
you scouted last night.
But more importantly, you're not alone.
A single sahuagin juvenile-smaller than the warriors, maybe four feet tall-is 
in the grotto, using a sharpened shell to scrape algae off the rocks into a woven 
basket. It hasn't noticed you yet, focused on its task.
What do you do?
Retreat
Dec 8
You freeze, then slowly begin backing up through the passage. The confined 
space that made stealth difficult now works in your favor-the juvenile is 
focused on its task, and the angle prevents it from seeing the narrow entrance 
you came through.
Stealth check to retreat: d20 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17
You move carefully, controlling your breathing, minimizing the water 
disturbance. The juvenile continues scraping algae, humming tunelessly.
You ease back through the tight section, feeling your way in reverse. The rock 
scrapes against your armor again, but the sound is muffled by the water. After 
what feels like an eternity but is probably only a minute, you see daylight 
ahead.
You emerge from the cleft, water streaming off you. Kessa has an arrow half-
nocked, her eyes sharp with concern. Cyrus grips his mace.
"Well?" Kessa asks quietly.
You pull off the cloak, catching your breath. "It connects. About thirty feet of 
tight passage, then a small grotto that opens into their main cave system. 
Passage would be mostly clear at low tide-viable for entry or escape."
"Guards?" Cyrus asks.
"One juvenile. Gathering food, I think. Didn't see me." You pause. "The tight 
section is a problem though. Single file, can't fight effectively in there. If 
they're waiting on the other side..."
"A death trap," Kessa finishes.
Tam nods sagely. "Told you. These caves are tricky."
You've completed your scouting. It's now mid-morning. What do 
you want to do next?
It is possible we might run into juveniles in this raid. How does Cyrus, our 
ethicist, want us to deal with them?
Dec 8
You turn to Cyrus. "We might encounter juveniles in there. Young ones like 
the one I just saw. How do you want us to handle that?"
Cyrus's expression grows somber. He's quiet for a long moment, one hand on 
his holy symbol.
"It's a hard question," he finally says. "Sahuagin are savage raiders who 
enslave and devour surface dwellers. But their young..." He looks out at the 
ocean. "They didn't choose what they were born as."
Kessa shifts uncomfortably. "They grow up to be the warriors we fought on the 
beach."
"They do," Cyrus agrees. "And sahuagin culture is brutal-they're raised to 
view us as prey. But killing children, even monstrous ones..." He shakes his 
head. "I can't ask you to do that in good conscience."
"So what then?" you ask. "Spare them? Try to capture them?"
Cyrus meets your eyes. "If they're armed and fighting us, defend yourselves. 
But if they're not-if they're like that one you saw, just going about their 
business-give them a chance to flee. We're here to eliminate the threat to the 
village, not to commit wholesale slaughter."
He pauses. "If we can drive them off, scatter them, make this cave 
uninhabitable for them-that accomplishes our goal. We don't need to kill 
every last one."
Tam speaks up quietly. "Those things murdered three fishermen. Tried to 
enslave more."
"The warriors did," Cyrus says firmly. "Not necessarily the young. I won't lose 
sleep over killing sahuagin who've proven themselves threats. But I'd prefer 
we show more mercy than they would. That's what separates us from them."
What's your response? This is your call as party leader.
Not true. Cyrus is a viral member of the party and I know his moral line isn't 
one to be crossed if we want him to stay, so that is our line, too.
Dec 8
You nod firmly. "That's our line then. If they're not armed and threatening us, 
we give them a chance to flee. We're here to end the threat, not massacre 
innocents-even sahuagin innocents."
Cyrus looks relieved. "Thank you. I know it complicates things."
"Better complicated than compromised," you say. "We need you, Cyrus. Your 
healing, your magic, your counsel. And we need to be able to live with what we 
do in there."
Kessa sighs but nods. "Fine. Warriors and threats get arrows. Young ones get a 
chance to run. But if one of them raises a weapon at me, juvenile or not, I'm 
defending myself."
"Fair," Cyrus agrees. "I'm not asking for recklessness. Just... restraint where 
possible."
Tam watches this exchange with something like approval. "You're good 
people. Strange, walking into sahuagin caves for a town you just met, but 
good."
You check the sun's position-still mid-morning. Low tide in a few hours. The 
plan is to wait until tonight when the sahuagin launch their raid on the town, 
then hit the cave while they're away.
"We should head back," Kessa suggests. "Make sure the traps are set properly, 
get some food, rest before tonight. It's going to be a long night."
Do you head back to town, or is there anything else you want to do 
out here?
Here's one more consideration. We might have to fight underwater. My EB can 
handle that with no problem, but Kessa and Cyrus, do they have alternates to 
the hand crossbow and mace that will work?
Dec 8
Good question. You turn to your companions. "One more thing-we might end 
up fighting underwater. My Eldritch Blast works fine, but what about you 
two?"
Kessa frowns, considering her hand crossbow. "Crossbow bolts underwater are 
useless. The resistance would make them ineffective past a few feet." She pats 
her short sword. "I've got my blade, but I'm not trained for underwater 
combat. I'll be at disadvantage on attack rolls unless I find a piercing weapon 
specifically designed for it."
Cyrus hefts his mace. "Bludgeoning weapons work underwater without 
penalty-the weight helps. My mace should be fine." He pauses. "Though my 
spell options are more limited. Most require verbal components, and speaking 
underwater with Water Breathing is... possible but difficult. I'd rely more on 
touch-range spells like Cure Wounds and my Channel Divinity."
"So Kessa's our weak link underwater," you summarize, not unkindly.
She grimaces. "Essentially, yes. I can fight if I have to, but I'll be significantly 
less effective. Better if I stay on dry sections and provide ranged support where 
possible."
"The cave had those ledges," Cyrus points out. "Kessa could move along those, 
stay above water, use her bow when there's line of sight. We fight in the 
flooded sections, she provides covering fire from high ground."
"That could work," Kessa says. "Assuming the cave layout allows for it."
Do you want to try finding Kessa a better weapon for underwater 
combat, or work with what you have? Head back to town now?
Did Tam have any ideasor told that could be used? Id not, let's check back on 
preparations, get some more rest, it's going to be a long night...
Dec 8
"Tam, any ideas? Tools or weapons around town that might work better 
underwater?"
The old fisherman scratches his beard thoughtfully. "Hmm. Nothing magical, 
if that's what you're hoping for. But..." He considers. "The fish gutting knives 
we use are short, heavy, designed to work when everything's wet and slippery. 
Piercing weapons. And there's harpoons at the docks-meant for big fish, but 
they'd punch through scaled hide well enough underwater."
Kessa perks up. "A harpoon could work. Reach, piercing damage, designed for 
water. Better than trying to swing a sword."
"Wilhelm would know where the best ones are stored," Tam says. "The barbed 
kind for big catches."
"Worth checking when we get back," Kessa agrees.
 
The four of you make your way back to town. The sun is climbing toward noon 
now, the day warming. The town remains eerily quiet-most buildings empty, 
your trap preparations standing ready.
Back at the Whalebone, Wilhelm is happy to provide Kessa with a well-made 
harpoon from the dock storage. It's about five feet long, sturdy ash wood with 
a wicked barbed iron head.
"Belonged to my grandfather," Wilhelm says. "Took down a shark once with 
this. Should serve you well."
Kessa tests the weight and balance. "This'll do nicely. Thank you."
Marten reports that all traps are set. Lanterns rigged, oil positioned, tripwires 
strung. "We're ready. Tam, Willem, and I will watch from the north ridge. 
When they commit to the town, we light the signal fire and run for Saltmere."
"Perfect," you say.
The afternoon stretches ahead. Sunset is still hours away.
"Get some rest," Cyrus advises. "Eat well. Tonight we end this."
Do you rest until evening, or is there anything else you want to 
prepare or discuss?
Rest.
Dec 8
You head upstairs to your room at the inn. The bed beckons, and despite 
having slept earlier, you know tonight will demand everything you have. You 
remove your armor, check your equipment one last time, and lie down.
Sleep comes easier this time-the sleep of someone who's made their plans 
and committed to action.
 
Several hours pass
You wake to the smell of cooking and the orange light of late afternoon 
filtering through the shutters. Your body feels rested, your mind clear and 
focused.
Downstairs, Aldric has prepared what he calls "a proper meal before a proper 
fight"-roasted fish, bread, root vegetables, and ale. Kessa and Cyrus are 
already eating. The remaining townspeople join you-a last meal together 
before the plan unfolds.
As the sun begins its descent toward the horizon, Marten, Tam, and Wilhelm 
gather their gear.
"We'll be in position on the north ridge by full dark," Marten says. "The signal 
fire is already laid-just needs a torch to light it. You'll see it clear from the 
cave entrance."
"Two hours after sunset, based on their pattern," Tam reminds you. "That's 
when they came last time."
"Be safe," Cyrus tells them. "Light the signal and run. Don't try to be heroes."
Wilhelm clasps your hand. "You've done right by us. Whatever happens 
tonight, thank you."
The three men head out into the gathering dusk.
Aldric bars the door behind them. "I'm staying. Someone needs to be here to 
rebuild if..." He doesn't finish the thought. "I'll be in the cellar. They won't find 
me."
The sun touches the horizon. Within the hour it will be full dark.
Kessa checks her new harpoon, her hand crossbow, her arrows. Cyrus 
murmurs prayers over his holy symbol, preparing mentally for the battle 
ahead.
It's almost time. Any final preparations, discussions, or are you 
ready to move to the cave?
Let's go and get settled in secure hiding spots.
Dec 8
You gather your equipment and head out into the twilight. The three of you 
move north along the coastal road, the dying sun painting the sky in shades of 
orange and purple.
The journey to the cave takes the familiar forty minutes. By the time you 
arrive, full darkness has fallen. The moon is rising, providing enough light to 
see by but casting deep shadows among the rocks.
You approach the main cave entrance cautiously.
Stealth checks: Johannes: d20 + 6 = 18 + 6 = 24 Kessa: d20 + 6 = 12 + 6 = 
18 Cyrus: d20 + 1 = 15 + 1 = 16
Silent as ghosts, you find positions among the rocks overlooking the cave 
entrance. You're about fifty feet away, elevated, with good line of sight but 
concealed in shadow.
Kessa nocks an arrow, ready but not drawn. Cyrus grips his holy symbol, lips 
moving in silent prayer. You settle into the darkness, your warlock senses 
alert.
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 14 + 3 = 17
You can hear movement from within the cave. Voices in that gurgling 
sahuagin language. Splashing water. They're active, preparing for something.
The wait begins. According to the pattern, the raiding party should emerge 
around two hours after sunset-roughly ninety minutes from now. Then they'll 
head south toward the town. Once Marten lights the signal fire, you'll know 
they've committed.
The minutes crawl past. The ocean crashes against the rocks below. The moon 
climbs higher.
Then, movement at the cave entrance.
Roll Perception: d20 + 3
Roll please
Dec 8
Rolling Perception: d20 + 3 = 9 + 3 = 12
You see shapes emerging from the cave entrance-sahuagin warriors, moving 
with purpose. In the moonlight, their scales gleam wetly.
You count them as they exit: one, two, three... six... ten... twelve warriors. 
They're armed with their coral spears and bone weapons, moving in a loose 
formation.
But no priestess this time-the one you killed was likely their only spellcaster, 
or at least their leader.
The war party gathers on the beach briefly, one of the larger warriors 
gesturing and hissing orders. Then they begin moving south along the 
shoreline toward the town.
You wait, watching them disappear into the darkness. Your position remains 
secure-they never looked up at the rocks.
More time passes. Perhaps twenty minutes.
Then, from the south, a brilliant orange glow suddenly blooms against the 
night sky. The signal fire. Marten has lit it-the sahuagin have committed to 
the town.
Kessa looks at you, her face illuminated by the distant firelight. Cyrus nods 
grimly.
The cave entrance below stands dark and unguarded. The raiding party is 
gone. Whatever remains inside-juveniles, guards, perhaps that larger 
creature from the tracks-is yours to deal with.
What's your approach? Enter immediately through the main 
entrance, wait a few more minutes, use the secondary entrance, or 
something else?
Go, this is a bull rush raid. No wasted time.
Dec 8
"Now. Fast and hard," you say, rising from your position.
The three of you move quickly down to the cave entrance, abandoning stealth 
for speed. Kessa has her harpoon ready, Cyrus his mace and holy symbol.
You stride into the cave mouth, eldritch energy already gathering at your 
fingertips. The familiar curve in the passage, then-
The first chamber opens before you, lit by that eerie phosphorescent glow.
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11
Two sahuagin warriors remain-apparently left as guards. They're in the 
water, startled by your sudden entrance. One raises a horn to its lips-
You don't give it the chance.
Roll Initiative: Johannes: d20 + 2 = 15 + 2 = 17 Kessa: d20 + 4 = 11 + 4 = 
15 Cyrus: d20 + 1 = 18 + 1 = 19 Sahuagin: d20 + 1 = 7 + 1 = 8
Initiative: Cyrus (19), Johannes (17), Kessa (15), Sahuagin (8)
Cyrus moves first, raising his holy symbol. Divine light blazes from it as he 
casts Bless on all three of you.
You, Kessa, and Cyrus can now add d4 to attack rolls and saving throws
"For those who cannot fight for themselves!" he shouts.
Your turn. Two sahuagin guards in the water, one reaching for a 
horn. What do you do?
Hex and EB for the one with the horn
Dec 8
You thrust your hand forward, dark whispers of Hex wrapping around the 
sahuagin with the horn, then unleash twin beams of eldritch force.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks (with Bless): Beam 1: d20 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17, 
plus Bless d4 = 3 = 20 - HIT Beam 2: d20 + 6 = 15 + 6 = 21, plus Bless d4 = 2 
= 23 - HIT
Damage Beam 1: d10 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 force, plus d6 Hex = 4 necrotic = 16 
total Damage Beam 2: d10 + 4 = 6 + 4 = 10 force, plus d6 Hex = 2 necrotic = 
12 total Total: 28 damage
Both beams slam into the sahuagin. The first punches through its chest, the 
second tears through its throat. The horn falls from its lifeless webbed hand, 
splashing into the water. The creature collapses backward into the surf.
Kessa's turn:
Kessa moves to the edge of the water, her new harpoon drawn back. She hurls 
it at the remaining guard.
Attack with Bless: d20 + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20, plus d4 = 3 = 23 - HIT Damage: d8 
+ 3 = 7 + 3 = 10 piercing
The harpoon takes the sahuagin in the shoulder, spinning it around. It shrieks 
in pain but stays standing.
Sahuagin's turn:
Wounded and alone, the creature makes a choice-it dives beneath the water 
and flees toward the deeper passage, disappearing into the darkness.
Combat paused.
The first chamber is clear. Ahead, you see the two passages you scouted: one 
sloping down into fully submerged water, one continuing level and partially 
flooded.
From deeper in the cave system, you hear alarmed hissing-the fleeing guard 
is raising the alarm.
"They know we're here now," Cyrus says grimly. "Which way?"
Do you pursue down the submerged passage, take the level 
passage, or split up?
Submerged.
Dec 8
"Submerged passage. That's where the main nest will be," you say, pulling out 
the Cloak of the Manta Ray and donning it. The magic activates immediately-
your lungs adapt, ready to breathe water.
Cyrus casts Water Breathing on himself, Kessa, and you (though you don't 
strictly need it with the cloak, the redundancy doesn't hurt).
"Ten hours of water breathing," he says. "More than enough."
The three of you wade into the deeper water. The passage slopes down steeply, 
and within ten feet you're fully submerged. The phosphorescent algae 
continues here, providing dim visibility-perhaps thirty feet in the murky 
water.
Perception check underwater: d20 + 3 = 13 + 3 = 16
The passage descends about twenty feet, then opens into a larger submerged 
chamber. Your eyes adjust to the gloom.
This is clearly their main nest. The chamber is perhaps sixty feet across, with 
rock formations providing cover and hiding spots. Crude shelters made of 
coral and bone dot the floor. Kelp gardens wave in the current.
And sahuagin. Many of them.
You count quickly: eight warriors, clearly armed and ready. Three juveniles 
cowering behind rock formations. And in the center-
The massive creature from the tracks. A sahuagin easily eight feet tall, 
powerfully muscled, covered in thick scales and scars. It wears armor made of 
overlapping shells and carries a huge trident crackling with electricity. A 
champion or chieftain.
The wounded guard you chased is pointing at you, hissing frantically.
The chieftain's eyes lock onto yours. It roars-a sound that carries even 
underwater-and levels its trident.
Roll Initiative: Johannes: d20 + 2 = 9 + 2 = 11 Kessa: d20 + 4 = 13 + 4 = 17 
Cyrus: d20 + 1 = 12 + 1 = 13 Sahuagin warriors: d20 + 1 = 14 + 1 = 
15 Chieftain: d20 + 2 = 16 + 2 = 18
Initiative: Chieftain (18), Kessa (17), Sahuagin (15), Cyrus (13), 
Johannes (11)
The chieftain moves first, swimming forward with terrifying speed and hurling 
its electric trident like a javelin-at you!
Attack: d20 + 7 = 19 + 7 = 26 - HIT Damage: 2d8 + 4 = 11 + 4 = 15 piercing, 
plus 2d6 = 7 lightning = 22 total damage
The trident strikes you dead center, electricity coursing through your body. 
You take 22 damage! The weapon magically returns to the chieftain's hand.
Kessa's turn - what does she do?
You're playing Kessa and Cyrus, remember?
Dec 8
You're absolutely right, my apologies!
Kessa's turn:
Kessa kicks hard through the water, positioning herself behind a rock 
formation for cover. She draws her hand crossbow-then curses as she 
remembers it's useless underwater. She drops it and draws her short sword 
instead.
She swims toward the nearest warrior, slashing with disadvantage.
Attack with disadvantage (and Bless): d20 + 6 = 4, d20 + 6 = 11, taking 
lower = 4 + 6 = 10, plus d4 Bless = 2 = 12 - MISS
The blade cuts through water but the sahuagin twists away.
"Damn it!" she shouts, bubbles erupting from her mouth.
Sahuagin warriors' turn:
Four of the warriors surge toward you, recognizing you as the primary threat. 
The other four move to engage Kessa and Cyrus.
Four attacks on Johannes (AC 14): Attack 1: d20 + 3 = 8 - MISS Attack 2: 
d20 + 3 = 16 - HIT for d6 + 1 = 6 damage Attack 3: d20 + 3 = 5 - MISS Attack 
4: d20 + 3 = 14 - HIT for d6 + 1 = 4 damage
You take 10 more damage from coral spears! (32 total damage taken)
Two attacks on Kessa, two on Cyrus - rolling... vs Kessa: 11, 7 - both MISS vs 
Cyrus (AC 16): 9, 15 - both MISS
Cyrus's turn:
Cyrus swims forward, his mace raised. He brings down his spiritual weapon-
a glowing mace-on the chieftain.
Spiritual Weapon attack: d20 + 6 = 13 + 6 = 19, plus d4 Bless = 3 = 22 - 
HIT Damage: d8 + 3 = 6 + 3 = 9 force damage
The glowing mace crashes into the chieftain's shoulder. It snarls but barely 
seems to notice.
Your turn, Johannes. You've taken 32 damage total. What do you 
do?
Hmm, the harpoon remember?
Dec 8
You're right! Let me rewind Kessa's turn.
Kessa's turn (corrected):
Kessa kicks through the water, harpoon in hand. She targets one of the 
warriors closing on you, thrusting with the weapon designed for exactly this 
situation.
Attack (with Bless): d20 + 6 = 14 + 6 = 20, plus d4 Bless = 3 = 23 - 
HIT Damage: d8 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 piercing, plus Sneak Attack 3d6 = 12 = 20 
total
The harpoon punches clean through the warrior's throat. It convulses and goes 
limp, drifting in the current.
"Much better!" she shouts through bubbles.
[Rest of the turn proceeds as written - you've taken 32 damage total 
from the chieftain's trident and two warrior spears]
Your turn, Johannes. What do you do?
Greater Healing (action or bonus action?)
Dec 8
Greater Healing is a bonus action with the Celestial warlock feature Healing 
Light.
You invoke your patron's power, channeling healing energy into yourself as a 
bonus action.
How many d6 do you want to spend? You have your Charisma modifier + 
warlock level worth of d6s per long rest (4 + 7 = 11d6 total pool)
Let me know how many dice you want to use, then you still have your action 
available for this turn!
Reminder: You're surrounded by four sahuagin warriors, with the 
chieftain looming nearby. What's your action?
But I'm not a Celestial warlock, remember?
Dec 8
You're absolutely right - I apologize for the confusion! Johannes is a Fiend 
pact warlock, not Celestial. You don't have Healing Light.
So you don't have a bonus action healing option.
Your turn, Johannes. You've taken 32 damage total. Four sahuagin 
warriors are surrounding you, and the chieftain is nearby. What do 
you do?
But what about a portion of greater healing?
Dec 8
Ah! Do you have a Potion of Greater Healing in your inventory? If so, 
drinking a potion is indeed an action (or you could use your action to 
administer it to someone else).
Let me check - I don't see a potion of greater healing explicitly listed in what 
we've established for Johannes's equipment. Do you have one that we should 
add to your inventory?
If you do have it:
*	Drinking it yourself: Action, heals 4d4+4 HP
*	Having someone else administer it to you: Their action
Or were you asking if there are any available from the town's supplies that you 
picked up? Kessa mentioned she found some basic healing supplies but 
"nothing magical" when she searched the town.
What would you like to do for your turn?
Seriously, can you please look at the inventory section of the starred chat 
Campaign log in the project library?
Dec 8
You're absolutely right - let me check the Campaign Log now.
Checking Johannes's inventory in the Campaign Log
I apologize - I've read through the entire Campaign Log and I don't see a 
specific inventory section listing consumable items like potions. The document 
has an "Inventory & Equipment" section mentioned in the table of contents 
(line 15), but the actual detailed inventory listing appears to be truncated in 
the view (note the "< truncated lines 255-1438 >" on line 254).
Let me view the specific inventory section:
Looking at the inventory section specifically
Let me check further in the document for the inventory section:
Checking for inventory details
Perfect! Found it. Let me continue reading:
Continuing inventory section for potions
Perfect! Found it. According to the Campaign Log inventory section (lines 714-
717):
Healing:
*	Potions of Greater Healing x2 (4d4+4 HP each)
You do have 2 Potions of Greater Healing! Drinking one is an action and heals 
4d4+4 HP.
So for your turn - do you want to:
1.	Drink a Potion of Greater Healing (action) - heals 4d4+4
2.	Do something else?
You've taken 32 damage so far out of your 66 HP, so you're at 34/66 HP 
currently.
Your turn - what do you do?
No cove, I have to heal, so no attack this round.
Dec 8
Understood. You pull out one of your Potions of Greater Healing and drink it 
quickly, the magical liquid restoring your vitality.
Rolling healing: 4d4 + 4 = (3 + 2 + 4 + 1) + 4 = 14 HP restored
You heal 14 HP, bringing you from 34/66 to 48/66 HP.
The wounds from the chieftain's electric trident and the coral spears close, 
though you're still bloodied from the fight.
Round 2 begins:
Chieftain's turn:
The massive sahuagin swims forward with frightening speed, this time 
attacking with claws and teeth instead of throwing the trident.
Two claw attacks and one bite at you: Claw 1: d20 + 7 = 12 + 7 = 19 - HIT for 
2d6 + 4 = 8 + 4 = 12 slashing Claw 2: d20 + 7 = 6 + 7 = 13 - MISS Bite: d20 + 
7 = 18 + 7 = 25 - HIT for 2d8 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 piercing
You take 25 more damage! (Now at 23/66 HP - badly wounded)
The chieftain's claws rake across your side and its jaws clamp onto your 
shoulder before you tear free.
Kessa's turn:
Kessa swims in, thrusting her harpoon at one of the warriors engaging Cyrus.
Attack with Bless: d20 + 6 = 17 + 6 = 23, plus d4 = 2 = 25 - HIT Damage: d8 
+ 3 = 4 + 3 = 7, plus Sneak Attack 3d6 = 14 = 21 total
Her harpoon punches through the warrior's chest. It goes limp.
Sahuagin warriors' turn:
The remaining seven warriors press their attacks.
Three on you, two on Kessa, two on Cyrus: vs Johannes: 15-HIT (5 damage), 
8-MISS, 11-MISS vs Kessa: 7-MISS, 13-MISS 
vs Cyrus: 12-MISS, 16-HIT (4 damage)
You take 5 more damage (18/66 HP). Cyrus takes 4 damage.
Cyrus's turn:
Cyrus moves his spiritual weapon to strike the chieftain while casting Cure 
Wounds on you at 2nd level.
Spiritual Weapon: d20 + 6 = 11 + 6 = 17, plus d4 = 1 = 18 - HIT for d8 + 3 = 5 
+ 3 = 8 damage to chieftain
Cure Wounds on Johannes: 2d8 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 HP restored
You're healed for 14 HP (back to 32/66).
"Stay with us!" Cyrus shouts through the water.
Your turn. The chieftain is wounded but still strong. Seven 
warriors remain. What do you do?
Hex and EB on Chieftain
Dec 8
You focus through the pain, channeling your patron's power. The Hex shifts to 
the chieftain, maddening whispers clawing at its mind as you unleash twin 
beams of eldritch force.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks (with Bless): Beam 1: d20 + 8 = 12 + 8 = 20, 
plus d4 Bless = 2 = 22 - HIT Beam 2: d20 + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15, plus d4 Bless = 3 = 
18 - HIT
Damage Beam 1: d10 + 4 = 9 + 4 = 13 force, plus d6 Hex = 3 necrotic = 16 
total Damage Beam 2: d10 + 4 = 7 + 4 = 11 force, plus d6 Hex = 5 necrotic = 
16 total Total: 32 damage
Both beams slam into the chieftain's massive form. It roars in pain and fury, 
clearly hurt now-your spiritual weapon strike and eldritch blasts have taken 
their toll. Blood clouds the water around it.
Round 3:
Chieftain's turn:
Wounded and enraged, the chieftain bellows a command in the sahuagin 
tongue. The three juveniles you saw earlier-cowering behind rocks-suddenly 
bolt for the deeper passages, fleeing in terror.
The chieftain raises its trident high and brings it down in a devastating 
overhead strike at you.
Attack: d20 + 7 = 20 + 7 = 27 - CRITICAL HIT Damage: 4d8 + 4 = 18 + 4 = 
22 piercing, plus 4d6 = 15 lightning = 37 total damage
The electric trident crashes into you with catastrophic force. You take 37 
damage!
You drop to -5 HP and are unconscious, dying!
You sink in the water, blood trailing from the massive wound.
"JOHANNES!" Kessa screams.
What happens next depends on your allies. Making death saves...
Death save 1: d20 = 12 - SUCCESS (1 success)
Kessa's turn - she immediately abandons her target and swims to 
you.
Ok. Keep going
Dec 8
Kessa's turn (continued):
Kessa abandons her attack and swims desperately to your sinking form. She 
grabs you, pulling you behind a rock formation for cover.
"Cyrus! HEAL HIM!" she shouts.
Sahuagin warriors' turn:
The seven remaining warriors sense blood in the water. Four surge toward 
Kessa and your unconscious body. Three continue attacking Cyrus.
Four attacks trying to get past Kessa to finish you: Attack 1 (vs Kessa): d20 + 
3 = 9 - MISS Attack 2 (vs Kessa): d20 + 3 = 17 - HIT for 5 damage Attack 3 
(vs Kessa): d20 + 3 = 6 - MISS Attack 4 (vs Kessa): d20 + 3 = 14 - MISS
Kessa takes 5 damage defending your body.
Three attacks on Cyrus: Attack 1: d20 + 3 = 11 - MISS Attack 2: d20 + 3 = 15 
- MISS Attack 3: d20 + 3 = 19 - HIT for 6 damage
Cyrus takes 6 damage.
Cyrus's turn:
"Hold them off!" Cyrus shouts at Kessa. He swims toward you, his hands 
glowing with divine light as he casts Cure Wounds at 3rd level (his highest 
remaining slot).
Healing: 3d8 + 4 = (7 + 6 + 5) + 4 = 22 HP
Divine energy floods through you. You gasp as consciousness returns, water 
filling your lungs before the Water Breathing spell reminds your body it can 
breathe.
You're at 17/66 HP, conscious but badly wounded.
His spiritual weapon crashes into the chieftain again.
Attack: d20 + 6 = 9 + 6 = 15, plus d4 Bless = 4 = 19 - HIT Damage: d8 + 3 = 6 
+ 3 = 9 force
The chieftain staggers from the blow but stays standing.
Your turn. You're at 17/66 HP. The chieftain is heavily wounded. 
Seven warriors remain, four of them surrounding you and Kessa. 
What do you do?
Eb chieftain
Dec 8
You force yourself upright in the water, pain lancing through your body. 
Through sheer will, you raise your hand and unleash eldritch energy at the 
wounded chieftain. The Hex is still active on it.
Rolling Eldritch Blast attacks (with Bless): Beam 1: d20 + 8 = 14 + 8 = 22, 
plus d4 Bless = 3 = 25 - HIT Beam 2: d20 + 8 = 4 + 8 = 12, plus d4 Bless = 2 = 
14 - HIT
Damage Beam 1: d10 + 4 = 10 + 4 = 14 force, plus d6 Hex = 4 necrotic = 18 
total Damage Beam 2: d10 + 4 = 3 + 4 = 7 force, plus d6 Hex = 2 necrotic = 9 
total Total: 27 damage
Both beams strike true. The first tears through the chieftain's chest, the second 
catches it in the throat.
The massive sahuagin's eyes go wide. It tries to raise its trident one more time, 
but the weapon slips from its webbed claws. The chieftain drifts backward, 
lifeless, sinking slowly toward the cave floor.
The remaining seven warriors see their leader fall. There's a moment of 
shocked stillness.
Then they break. All seven scatter, swimming frantically for the exits-some 
toward the main passage, others diving deeper into crevices and side tunnels.
Combat ended.
The nest chamber falls quiet except for the sound of your ragged breathing 
and the distant sound of fleeing sahuagin.
Kessa immediately turns to you. "Can you swim? We need to secure this place 
and make sure they don't regroup."
Cyrus floats nearby, exhausted but alert. "I have one more healing spell if you 
need it."
You're at 17/66 HP. What do you do?
I have one more greater healing
Dec 8
You pull out your second and last Potion of Greater Healing, drinking it down.
Rolling healing: 4d4 + 4 = (4 + 3 + 2 + 4) + 4 = 17 HP restored
You heal 17 HP, bringing you from 17/66 to 34/66 HP. Still bloodied, but 
functional.
"Save your spell," you tell Cyrus. "We're not done yet."
Kessa scans the chamber, harpoon ready. The chieftain's body lies on the cave 
floor, its electric trident nearby. Around the chamber you can see the crude 
shelters, kelp gardens, and scattered belongings of the sahuagin nest.
"The warriors fled, but they could regroup," Kessa says. "And those juveniles 
ran deeper-there might be more chambers we haven't found."
Cyrus gestures to the various passages leading out of this chamber. "We could 
pursue them and make sure they don't return. Or we could search this place 
for intelligence, supplies, anything that tells us if there are more nests or 
threats."
You notice several things:
*	The chieftain's trident (magical weapon)
*	Various crude equipment and supplies scattered around
*	Multiple exits from this chamber (some lead up toward air, others go 
deeper)
*	No sign of the Silver Catch crew or any prisoners
What do you want to do? Pursue the fleeing sahuagin, search the 
nest, check the passages, or something else?
Search the nest. Try to figure out why the sanguine are attacking and what the 
priestess was doing. Grab the trident while we're at it.
Dec 8
"Search the nest," you say, swimming toward the chieftain's body. "We need to 
know why they were attacking the town and what that priestess was planning."
You retrieve the electric trident-it's heavy even in the water, crackling with 
residual energy. Definitely magical.
Investigation check: d20 + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
The three of you methodically search the chamber. What you find paints a 
disturbing picture:
Near the Chieftain's Area:
*	A crude altar made of coral and bone, dedicated to Sekolah (the Shark 
God)
*	But behind it, partially hidden: symbols you recognize from darker 
texts-marks of something deeper, older
*	Offerings: humanoid bones (some recent), pearls, salvaged ship goods
In the Priestess's Shelter (you recognize her belongings):
*	Ritual components for enchantment magic
*	A waterproof scroll case containing more maps-not just this village, but 
THREE other coastal settlements marked
*	Notes in Sahuagin script (which you can't read, but Cyrus can make out 
some through divine insight): "The Deep One hungers... surface dwellers 
make worthy thralls... gather strength... when the stars align..."
*	The cursed items (shells, coins, mask) were clearly mass-produced-
there's a whole workshop area with partially-completed pieces
Evidence of the Missing Crew:
*	Torn clothing and personal effects from the Silver Catch
*	Three sets of manacles, recently used
*	A pile of gnawed bones (humanoid) in a refuse area
*	No survivors
Strategic Intelligence:
*	This wasn't just random raiding-this was organized recruitment
*	The enchanted items were meant to build an army of thralls
*	Multiple coastal towns were targeted
*	Something called "the Deep One" is behind this, using Sekolah worship 
as cover
Kessa holds up the maps grimly. "Three other villages. They were planning to 
hit them all."
Cyrus examines the altar. "This Deep One... it's not Sekolah. The sahuagin 
were being used by something worse. Something that wants thralls, not just 
prey."
What do you do with this information?
Do we think we'll find the crew or is it likely they were eaten?
Dec 8
You look at the gnawed bones in the refuse pile, then at Cyrus. "The crew from 
the Silver Catch-any chance they're still alive somewhere?"
Cyrus kneels by the bones, examining them with a grim expression. He 
murmurs a prayer, and faint divine light reveals traces of...
"These bones are human," he says quietly. "Recent. Within the last week." He 
stands, shaking his head. "I'm sorry. The timing matches the Silver Catch's 
disappearance."
Kessa clenches her jaw. "They didn't take prisoners to keep. They took them to 
eat."
You notice the manacles were used-likely to restrain the fishermen during 
transport back to the nest. But there's no evidence of cells, holding areas, or 
any infrastructure for keeping captives long-term. The refuse pile tells the rest 
of the story.
"The thralls from the village-Mara, Jens, the others-they were being 
collected for something different," you observe. "The enchanted items, the 
'Deep One' the notes mentioned. But the Silver Catch crew were just... food."
Cyrus nods sadly. "Their families deserve to know they're gone. We can bring 
back some personal effects as proof-give them closure."
The three fishermen are dead. But you saved the townspeople from that fate, 
and the maps show you potentially prevented this from happening to three 
other villages.
Do you want to:
1.	Collect evidence/items to bring back to the town
2.	Continue searching for other passages or threats
3.	Destroy this nest completely to ensure they can't return
4.	Something else
1, 3, then 2. How long have we been here?
Dec 8
Good thinking on the sequence.
Time Assessment:
You entered the cave shortly after the signal fire was lit. The combat took 
perhaps 5-10 minutes total (multiple rounds). Searching the nest has taken 
another 15-20 minutes.
You estimate you've been in the cave system for roughly 30-40 minutes total.
The sahuagin raiding party that went to the town would have arrived there 
maybe 10-15 minutes ago, discovered it empty and trapped, and are likely 
either still dealing with the traps or retreating back toward the cave. You 
probably have another 20-30 minutes before they could return, if they're 
coming back at all.
 
Collecting Evidence:
You gather:
*	Personal effects from the Silver Catch crew (a carved pipe, a silver 
locket, a distinctive fishing knife)
*	The priestess's ritual notes and maps showing the other targeted villages
*	Several of the cursed items as proof of what was happening
*	The chieftain's trident (powerful magical weapon)
Destroying the Nest:
"Burn it," you say. "Make sure they can't come back."
Kessa pulls out the oil flasks she got from the town. "These won't work 
underwater, but if we can get to air-filled sections..."
Cyrus nods. "The level passage we saw earlier-parts of it are above water. We 
can set fires there, collapse sections, make this place uninhabitable."
You spend the next 10 minutes systematically destroying the nest:
*	Smashing the altars and ritual components
*	Using oil and fire in the accessible dry sections
*	Collapsing key structural points with the Rope of Entanglement and 
brute force
*	Destroying the workshop where cursed items were being made
Smoke begins filling the upper chambers. The nest is ruined.
Searching for Other Passages:
With the destruction underway, you have time to check the other exits.
Perception check: d20 + 3 = 11 + 3 = 14
You find:
*	The passage leading to the smaller entrance you scouted (where you saw 
the juvenile)
*	Two passages leading deeper and fully underwater-likely connect to 
open ocean
*	One collapsed passage (looks old, probably natural cave-in)
*	No other nests or chambers of significance
The fleeing sahuagin likely escaped through the deep-water passages to the 
open ocean.
Total time elapsed: About 50-60 minutes since you entered.
What do you want to do now? Head back to check on the town? 
Pursue through the ocean passages? Something else?
Get back to solid dry land and see how bad things are in the town.
Dec 8
"Let's get back to the surface," you say. "Check on the town and make sure the 
traps worked."
The three of you swim back through the flooded passages toward the main 
entrance. As you ascend, the water becomes shallower until you're wading, 
then finally stepping onto the rocky beach outside the cave.
You pull off the Cloak of the Manta Ray as the Water Breathing spell 
continues to work-though it's no longer needed. The night air is cold and 
sharp after the underwater battle.
Kessa wrings out her hair. "We look like drowned rats."
Behind you, smoke begins seeping from the cave entrance-evidence of the 
fires burning in the upper chambers.
The walk back to town takes the familiar forty minutes. As you approach, you 
can see the signal fire on the north ridge has burned down to embers. No 
sounds of combat. No screams. Just... silence.
You enter the main street cautiously.
The town is a mess. Several of the tripwires have been triggered-pots and 
bells scattered across the ground. The warehouse near the docks has scorch 
marks around the entrance where oil traps ignited. Footprints in the sand 
show the sahuagin arrived, explored, triggered traps.
But no bodies. No blood. No signs of a prolonged fight.
Aldric emerges from the inn's cellar, eyes wide. "You're alive! I heard the 
commotion, the bells, saw the flames... the fish-creatures came through, 
triggered half the traps, then just... left. Went back toward the water maybe 
twenty minutes ago."
So the raiding party found an empty, trapped town, got burned and spooked, 
and retreated.
"The nest?" Aldric asks hopefully.
What do you tell him?
Everything.
Dec 8
You tell Aldric everything-the underwater nest, the battle with the chieftain 
and warriors, the three juveniles that fled, the fate of the Silver Catch crew.
His face falls when you describe the bones and personal effects. "Gods. Gareth, 
Finn, and Thomas. Good men. Their families..." He swallows hard. "At least 
they'll know. That's something."
You show him the maps with the other marked villages. "This wasn't random. 
They were building toward something-a 'Deep One' the priestess's notes 
mentioned. They wanted thralls, not just food. Three other coastal settlements 
were targeted."
Aldric's expression hardens. "We need to warn them."
"The nest is destroyed," Cyrus adds. "We made sure they can't return to it. The 
warriors that fled scattered into the open ocean."
You place the cursed items on the inn's bar-the shells, the ritual components. 
"These were being mass-produced. Your people who wore them were being 
prepared for... something. Conditioning them to serve this Deep One."
"But Petra's free now," Kessa says. "And Mara, Jens, Gareth-all of them. 
Because we broke the enchantments and killed the casters."
Aldric looks at the chieftain's electric trident you're carrying. "You killed their 
leader and their priestess. Burned their home. The survivors won't come back 
here-they'll know this place is defended."
He pours himself a drink with shaking hands. "The town's at Saltmere. Should 
be there by now, or close to it. Marten will have told them what happened, 
what you did."
He raises his glass. "To Johannes, Kessa, and Brother Cyrus. Saviors of a town 
they'd never been to before."
What do you do? Rest here tonight? Head to Saltmere? Send 
warnings to the other villages? Something else?
As much as I want to rest (and need to), we don't have the time yet. Recruit 
Aldrich to come with us to the next town as a Witness to earn them, then send 
a party to warn the other group while we recover.
Dec 8
"I want to rest," you say, exhaustion evident in your voice. "But we don't have 
time. Those other villages are still targeted, and the sahuagin that escaped 
might regroup or warn other nests."
You turn to Aldric. "We need you to come with us to the nearest marked 
village as a witness. You can vouch for what happened here, make them take 
the threat seriously. We'll help them prepare, then send a party to warn the 
third village while we finally rest."
Aldric sets down his glass, determination replacing the shock. "Aye. I'll come. 
These are fishing communities-we all know each other, trade with each other. 
If I tell them what happened here, they'll listen."
Kessa unfolds the map. "Closest marked village is... Beacon's Rest. About eight 
miles down the coast. If we leave now, we could be there before dawn."
Cyrus winces but nods. "I have enough healing magic to keep us going. Let's 
finish this."
"Give me five minutes," Aldric says. "I'll gather supplies and lock up the inn."
 
The journey to Beacon's Rest is grueling. You're all wounded, exhausted, 
running on willpower alone. But as the sky begins to lighten with pre-dawn 
gray, you see the lights of another fishing village ahead.
This one is slightly larger than Saltmere-maybe 150 people. Boats are being 
prepared for the morning catch as you approach.
A guard at the edge of town-an older man with a spear-challenges you. 
"State your business."
Aldric steps forward. "Harvin! It's me, Aldric from Saltmere. I need to speak to 
your council immediately. There's an attack coming."
Harvin's eyes widen. "Aldric? What in the-you look like you've been through 
the hells."
"Close enough," Aldric says grimly. "Get the council. Now. Lives depend on it."
What's your approach when you meet with Beacon's Rest's council?
Let Alaric and Curtis speak
Dec 8
Smart. Let the locals and the cleric handle it-they'll be more credible than a 
warlock covered in blood and seawater.
 
Within twenty minutes, you're standing in a modest town hall. Five council 
members sit at a table-fishermen, a merchant, the harbormaster. They look 
skeptical and alarmed in equal measure.
Aldric speaks first. "Three nights ago, sahuagin raided Saltmere. They tried to 
enslave our people using cursed items they'd planted-shells, coins, masks. 
The enchantments made people walk into the sea."
One council member scoffs. "Sahuagin? This far south? That's-"
"I saw them," Aldric cuts in, his voice hard. "Fish-men with weapons of coral 
and bone. They took three of my neighbors-the Silver Catch and her crew. 
Killed and ate them."
The room goes silent.
Cyrus steps forward, his cleric's vestments still damp but his holy symbol 
visible. "I am Brother Cyrus, cleric of Kiri-Jolith. What Aldric says is true. I 
helped free four people from enchantment magic. We tracked the sahuagin to 
their nest and destroyed it-but not before finding this."
He spreads out the priestess's maps on the table. Three coastal villages 
marked. Beacon's Rest is one of them.
"They were planning to hit multiple settlements," Cyrus continues. "Building 
an army of thralls for something they called 'the Deep One.' Your village is on 
their list."
The harbormaster leans forward, studying the map. "This is... this is our 
coastline. That's Beacon's Rest marked right there."
Aldric nods. "We evacuated Saltmere and set traps. When they came for us, 
they found nothing but fire and empty houses. We destroyed their nest, but 
some escaped. They might regroup. They might warn others. You need to 
prepare."
The council members exchange worried glances.
"What do you suggest?" one asks quietly.
Cyrus and Aldric look to you. How do you want them to answer?
Retreat. To Saltmere. The distance from the water should discourage pursuit 
until we determine just how serious this threat is. And send a large party, with 
Aldric, to earn the other settlement of possible threat. We came to give you 
enough time to gather your valuables and leave without panic, but you have 
to have to start now.
Dec 8
You step forward. "Retreat. To Saltmere-it's inland, far enough from the 
water to discourage pursuit until we know how serious this threat really is."
The council members start to protest, but you raise a hand. "We came here to 
give you time to gather your valuables and evacuate without panic. But you 
need to start now. Not tomorrow. Not after discussing it. Now."
Cyrus nods gravely. "The sahuagin came for Saltmere two hours after sunset. 
You have maybe twelve hours before they could strike here-less if they're 
already watching."
Aldric adds, "Saltmere took us in once before during storm season. They'll take 
you too. Bring what you can carry, livestock if possible, but don't delay for 
anything that slows you down."
You continue, "Send a large, fast party with Aldric to warn the third village-" 
you tap the map, "-here. Give them the same warning, the same choice. 
Meanwhile, your people move inland."
The harbormaster looks stricken. "Abandon our homes? Our livelihoods?"
"Temporarily," Cyrus says firmly. "We destroyed one nest, but we don't know 
if there are others. We don't know what this 'Deep One' is or how many 
sahuagin serve it. Until we do, the coast isn't safe."
One of the council members-a weathered woman-stands. "I believe them. 
I've fished these waters forty years. Something's been wrong lately. Fewer fish, 
strange currents, odd sounds at night. If they say monsters are coming, I'm 
not waiting to find out."
Another council member nods slowly. "Agreed. We evacuate. Better safe than 
dead."
The harbormaster sighs heavily. "Alright. I'll organize the boats and wagons. 
We can be moving within two hours."
Aldric stands. "I'll take ten riders to Driftwood Cove-that's the third village. 
We can be there by midday, give them warning, come back through Saltmere."
You sway slightly on your feet, exhaustion finally catching up.
Kessa steadies you. "We need rest. Now. Before we collapse."
The council woman gestures to a side room. "There are bunks in the back. 
Sleep. We'll handle the evacuation. You've done enough."
Do you rest here while the evacuation proceeds, or push on to help 
with something else?
Long rest. I've taken a real beating
Dec 8
"We need to rest," you say, and even speaking feels like an effort. "Long rest. 
I've taken a real beating."
No one argues. Cyrus looks ready to collapse, and Kessa has been favoring her 
wounded arm for the last hour.
The council woman leads you to a back room with several simple bunks. 
"Sleep as long as you need. We'll wake you when the evacuation's complete, or 
if there's trouble."
You barely make it to the bunk before exhaustion claims you. Your armor 
comes off, your weapons within reach, and then-
Sleep.
 
LONG REST
You regain all hit points: 66/66 HP You regain all spell slots: 2x 4th level 
slots Kessa and Cyrus also fully recover
 
You wake to afternoon sunlight streaming through a window. Your body 
aches, but the wounds are healed-Cyrus must have used his remaining magic 
while you slept. You feel restored, capable again.
Outside, you hear the organized chaos of a town evacuating-wagons creaking, 
voices calling instructions, livestock being herded.
Kessa is already awake, sharpening her blades. "You were out for about ten 
hours. The town's nearly evacuated-they'll be on the road within the hour. 
Aldric left for Driftwood Cove six hours ago with his riders."
Cyrus enters, carrying food. "Eat. The council wants to thank you before they 
leave, but there's no rush."
Through the window, you can see Beacon's Rest being systematically emptied. 
Families with packed carts, fishermen leading their boats to be towed inland, 
the organized retreat of a community that's done this before for storms-but 
never for monsters.
What do you want to do? Meet with the council? Check on anything 
specific? Head back toward Saltmere?
Check out the loot we collected, especially that trident.
Dec 8
Good idea. You pull out the items you collected from the nest and lay them out 
to examine properly.
The Chieftain's Trident:
Arcana check: d20 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19
This is definitely a magic weapon. Holding it, you can feel the crackle of 
electrical energy running through it. Based on your knowledge and testing:
*	Trident of Warning (requires attunement)
*	+1 to attack and damage rolls
*	While attuned, you have advantage on initiative rolls
*	You and any companions within 30 feet can't be surprised (except when 
incapacitated)
*	The weapon magically awakens you and your companions if any of you 
are sleeping when combat begins
The electrical damage you experienced was likely from the chieftain's own 
abilities, not the weapon itself. This is more of a defensive/utility weapon than 
an offensive powerhouse.
Other Collected Items:
*	Cursed items (shells, ritual components): Dangerous, probably should 
be destroyed or locked away
*	Maps and notes: Intelligence on three targeted villages, references to 
"the Deep One"
*	Personal effects from the Silver Catch crew: For their families
*	Sahuagin weapons (coral spears, bone knives): Crude but functional, 
minimal value
Your Current Attunement:
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding (critical, non-negotiable)
2.	Amulet of Health (essential)
3.	Rope of Entanglement (utility)
The Trident of Warning is excellent-advantage on initiative and preventing 
surprise could be lifesaving. You'd need to swap out your Rope of 
Entanglement to attune to it.
Kessa looks at the trident. "That's a nice find. The warning ability alone could 
save our lives."
Cyrus examines the cursed items carefully. "These need to be destroyed 
properly. Fire won't be enough-they need divine purification or they could 
spread their taint."
What do you want to do with the trident? Attune to it? And what 
about the cursed items?
Does Curtis have space to take the rope do i can swap it for the trident?
Dec 8
You turn to Cyrus. "Do you have attunement space available? I'd like to swap 
the rope for the trident, but the rope's still useful-could you attune to it?"
Cyrus considers. "Let me think about what I'm carrying..." He counts on his 
fingers. "I don't have any attuned items currently. Most clerics don't 
accumulate as many magic items as you warlocks seem to." He smiles slightly. 
"Yes, I can attune to the Rope of Entanglement. Battlefield control would be 
useful, and it doesn't require me to be in melee range."
"Perfect." You hand him the rope and begin the process of unattuning from it 
and attuning to the Trident of Warning instead.
This takes about an hour of focused meditation and connection with the item.
As you attune, you feel the trident's magic sync with your awareness. It's like 
gaining a sixth sense-a constant alertness, a readiness. You understand 
instinctively that this weapon will warn you of danger before it strikes.
Attunement Updated:
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding
2.	Amulet of Health
3.	Trident of Warning (new)
Cyrus attuned to: Rope of Entanglement
Kessa watches the process with interest. "So now you'll be even harder to 
ambush. Good. I was getting tired of you nearly dying."
What do you want to do about the cursed items Cyrus mentioned 
need proper destruction?
Same thing we did last time?
Dec 8
"Same thing we did last time," you say. "Find a well, Cyrus consecrates the 
water, we dump them in."
Cyrus nods. "Simple and effective. The blessed water will suppress their magic 
indefinitely."
You ask one of the council members about a well. They point you to the town's 
main well in the square-deep, stone-lined, reliable.
Cyrus performs the consecration ritual, his holy symbol glowing as divine light 
infuses the water below. It takes about ten minutes.
Once complete, you drop the cursed shells, the ritual components, and the 
other tainted items into the sanctified depths. Each one hits the water with a 
splash, and you feel the malevolent energy fade immediately as the blessed 
water neutralizes them.
"Sealed away," Cyrus says, replacing the well cover. "They can be retrieved 
later if needed for study, but they won't harm anyone now."
The harbormaster approaches. "We're about ready to move. The last families 
are loading their wagons now. We should reach Saltmere by nightfall if we 
keep a good pace."
Kessa stretches. "So what's our plan? Escort them to Saltmere? Head back to 
Haven and report this to Laurana? Wait for Aldric's news from Driftwood 
Cove?"
It's a good question. You've handled the immediate threat, warned two 
villages, and sent warning to the third. But the deeper mystery remains-what 
is this "Deep One" the sahuagin were serving?
What do you want to do?
Check the map, is there any indication of staging areas nearby, should the 
other group be back yet?
Dec 8
You pull out the priestess's maps and study them carefully with fresh eyes.
Investigation check: d20 + 5 = 17 + 5 = 22
Looking more closely at the markings, you notice several things you missed in 
your initial examination:
The Three Targeted Villages:
1.	Saltmere (already hit, nest destroyed)
2.	Beacon's Rest (current location, now evacuating)
3.	Driftwood Cove (8 miles further south along the coast)
Additional Markings:
*	There's a larger symbol marked offshore, roughly equidistant from all 
three villages-about 5-6 miles out to sea
*	Depth notations suggest it's in deep water, maybe 200+ feet
*	Crude drawings that might represent underwater formations or 
structures
*	Lines connecting this central point to each village
"This isn't just individual nests," you say, pointing. "There's something out 
there. Deeper. This might be where the 'Deep One' actually is."
Kessa leans over your shoulder. "So the nest we destroyed was just... an 
outpost? A forward operating base?"
"Looks that way," you confirm.
Timing on Aldric's Party:
Cyrus checks the sun's position. "Aldric left about six hours ago for Driftwood 
Cove. It's roughly 15-20 miles from here if he goes overland. At a good riding 
pace, he should arrive there in another 2-3 hours, deliver the warning, then... 
if they turn around immediately, they'd be back to Saltmere late tonight or 
early tomorrow morning."
So Aldric won't have news for at least another 8-12 hours.
What do you want to do?
But you isu said it was 8 miles away?
Dec 8
You're absolutely right - I made an error. Let me recalculate:
Driftwood Cove is 8 miles from Beacon's Rest (as shown on the map).
Corrected Timing:
Aldric left 6 hours ago with mounted riders. At a decent riding pace (5-6 mph), 
they would cover 8 miles in roughly 90 minutes to 2 hours.
So Aldric's party would have:
*	Arrived at Driftwood Cove: ~4 hours ago
*	Delivered the warning and gotten the town organized: 1-2 hours
*	Been on the return journey for: ~2 hours already
Distance from Driftwood Cove to Saltmere (going through Beacon's Rest): 
roughly 16 miles total.
Aldric should actually be arriving back at Beacon's Rest very soon - 
possibly within the next hour or two, depending on how long Driftwood Cove 
took to organize.
That changes things significantly. You might actually be able to wait here and 
get his report before deciding your next move.
Do you want to wait for Aldric to return, or proceed with a 
different plan?
Share my observations with the others, what do they think
Dec 8
You gather Kessa and Cyrus and spread out the map, pointing to your 
findings.
"This isn't just individual nests," you explain. "Look-there's a larger symbol 
marked offshore, roughly equidistant from all three villages. Deep water, 
maybe 200 feet down. Lines connecting it to each coastal target."
Kessa studies the markings. "So the nest we destroyed was just an outpost. A 
forward base for raiding. The real threat is out there." She taps the offshore 
symbol.
"And Aldric should be back soon," you add. "Maybe within the hour or two. 
We could wait for his report from Driftwood Cove before deciding what to do 
about this."
Cyrus frowns at the map, his expression troubled. "If this 'Deep One' is 200 
feet down in the open ocean... that's beyond our capability to reach, even 
with Water Breathing. The pressure alone would be dangerous, and we'd be in 
their element completely."
"Not to mention we barely survived one nest," Kessa points out. "If that was 
just an outpost and there's something bigger out there..." She doesn't finish 
the thought.
Cyrus looks at you. "This might be beyond the three of us. We've done what we 
can-destroyed one nest, saved three villages, gathered intelligence. But a 
deep-ocean assault on whatever this Deep One is? That needs resources we 
don't have. Ships, experienced divers, maybe mages with specialized magic."
Kessa nods slowly. "We should get this information to Laurana at Haven. Or to 
someone with the resources to mount a proper expedition. This is turning into 
something bigger than a local threat."
"But," Cyrus adds, "we should wait for Aldric. Confirm Driftwood Cove is 
warned and safe. Then we can make an informed decision."
What do you think? Wait for Aldric, then head to Haven with the 
intelligence? Or do you have another plan?
Do we still have a sending stone to Lauranne?
Dec 8
Good question. Let me check your established inventory and communication 
methods.
Looking back at the campaign log, I see you have Khisanth's Scale for 
communicating with the dragon, but I don't see a sending stone or similar 
magical communication device established with Laurana.
The resistance operations have been coordinated through in-person meetings 
and messenger systems, but no magical long-distance communication has 
been mentioned in your equipment or previous sessions.
You could:
1.	Use conventional messengers (riders to Haven)
2.	Head to Haven yourself to report
3.	See if Beacon's Rest or Saltmere has any communication magic available
4.	Wait until you're back at Haven to deliver the intelligence in person
"Do we have any way to contact Laurana from here?" you ask the others.
Kessa shakes her head. "Not magically. We'd need to send a rider or go 
ourselves."
Cyrus adds, "Some larger temples have Sending scrolls or trained clerics who 
can cast it, but a fishing village..." He looks doubtful.

Perfect! You do have sending stones. According to the conversation from the 
Pax Tharkas operation:
Sending Stone Setup:
*	Stone 1: Laurana keeps at Haven
*	Stone 2: Was with Garrett's team during the Saltmere operation, then 
cached for you to retrieve later
The question is: Do you still have the stone you retrieved from 
Garrett's cache? Based on the conversation, you should have picked it up 
after the Gharash assassination on your way to Solace.
"Wait," you say. "The sending stone. I should still have the one we retrieved 
from Garrett's cache after Saltmere."
You check your Bag of Holding and pull out the smooth river stone with 
arcane runes.
Kessa's eyes light up. "Right! We can contact Laurana directly. One message 
per day, 25 words."
You hold the stone, thinking about what to say. One sending, 25 words 
maximum.
What message do you want to send to Laurana?
Yes. Let her know what we're facing and see what she thinks
Dec 8
You hold the sending stone and compose your message carefully, keeping it to 
25 words:
"Destroyed sahuagin nest raiding coastal villages. Found maps showing larger 
threat offshore-'Deep One' coordinating attacks. Three villages evacuated. 
Need guidance on next steps. -Johannes"
The stone grows warm in your hand as the magic activates.
There's a pause of perhaps thirty seconds, then Laurana's voice echoes in your 
mind, crisp and clear:
"Excellent work saving villages. Deep ocean threat beyond our resources. 
Bring intelligence to Haven. We'll coordinate with coastal authorities. Return 
when able. -Laurana"
The stone cools. Message delivered and received.
Kessa raises an eyebrow. "She wants us back at Haven with the intel. Makes 
sense-this is bigger than just us or even the resistance. Coastal defenses, 
naval forces, maybe mages who specialize in underwater work."
Cyrus nods. "The Church of Kiri-Jolith has contacts with maritime temples. 
They might have resources for dealing with deep-sea threats. But we'd need to 
go through proper channels."
"So our options," Kessa says, counting on her fingers. "One: Wait for Aldric, 
confirm Driftwood Cove is safe, then head to Haven with everything we've 
learned. Two: Split up-some of us wait for Aldric, others head to Haven 
immediately. Three: Do something else entirely."
What do you want to do?
Wait for Aldric
Dec 8
"We wait for Aldric," you say. "We need to confirm Driftwood Cove got the 
warning and is evacuating. Then we'll have the complete picture to bring to 
Laurana."
Cyrus nods approvingly. "Good. Don't leave the job half-finished."
Kessa settles against a wall. "Besides, we could use a few more hours of rest 
before a long journey back to Haven."
 
Time passes. The evacuation of Beacon's Rest continues around 
you-organized chaos as families load wagons, secure livestock, 
prepare for the journey inland to Saltmere.
About two hours later, as the afternoon sun angles lower, you hear hoofbeats. 
A group of riders approaches from the south-Aldric and his warning party, 
returning.
Aldric dismounts wearily but with evident relief. "Driftwood Cove is warned 
and evacuating. They believed us-especially after I showed them the maps 
and described what happened to Saltmere. They'll be heading inland within 
hours."
He looks at the three of you. "All three villages safe. Whatever those fish-devils 
were planning, you've broken it up completely."
The harbormaster of Beacon's Rest approaches. "We're ready to move. Last 
wagon is loaded."
Aldric nods. "We'll travel together to Saltmere. Safety in numbers."
You now have:
*	All three coastal villages warned and evacuating
*	The sahuagin nest destroyed
*	Intelligence on the offshore "Deep One" threat
*	Physical evidence (maps, notes, items)
*	The chieftain's trident
*	Personal effects from the Silver Catch crew
Do you:
1.	Travel with the evacuation caravan to Saltmere (reunite the 
townspeople, deliver closure about the crew)
2.	Head directly to Haven with the intelligence
3.	Something else
Are there maritime temples or other sources nearby? I can't imagine we can 
just leave this as is.
Dec 8
Good point. You turn to Cyrus. "You mentioned maritime temples-are there 
any nearby? I can't imagine we can just leave this threat as is. Those sahuagin 
could regroup, or this Deep One could send other forces."
Cyrus considers. "The closest major port with significant temple presence 
would be... Palanthas, but that's weeks away, far to the north. There's also Port 
Balifor to the southeast, but similar distance."
Aldric speaks up. "There's Ak-Thyln-a coastal city maybe three days' hard 
ride northeast from here. It's got a naval garrison, proper harbor defenses, 
temples to several sea deities. If anyone has resources to deal with deep-water 
threats, it'd be them."
The harbormaster nods. "Ak-Thyln's got patrol ships, experienced sailors 
who've dealt with sahuagin before. They've got mages who work with the fleet 
too-divination specialists, water-breathers, that sort."
Kessa looks at you thoughtfully. "So we have options. We could go to Ak-Thyln 
directly-three days, get proper naval and magical resources on this 
immediately. Or we could go to Haven first, report to Laurana, let her 
coordinate with Ak-Thyln and other authorities through official channels. 
Slower, but more organized."
Cyrus adds, "Or we split-one of us goes to Ak-Thyln to raise the alarm, the 
others go to Haven with the intelligence. Cover both fronts."
Aldric interjects, "The people of all three villages-we'll be at Saltmere. We 
deserve to know what happens, whether this threat is truly ended or if we're 
just... waiting for it to come back."
What do you want to do?
We go to Ak-Thyln immediately and start trying to get a real plan going
Dec 8
"We go to Ak-Thyln," you say decisively. "Immediately. This Deep One is still 
out there, and those scattered sahuagin could regroup or warn other nests. We 
need proper naval and magical resources on this now, not weeks from now 
after messages get passed through channels."
Kessa nods. "Three days hard ride. We'll need horses and supplies."
Aldric steps forward. "Take ours-the horses we rode from Saltmere. They're 
still fresh enough, and we won't need them once we're inland with the 
wagons." He gestures to his riders. "We can spare provisions too."
The harbormaster adds, "I'll write you a letter of introduction to Admiral 
Kethren in Ak-Thyln. Former fisherman himself before he joined the navy. 
He'll listen, especially with physical evidence."
Cyrus looks concerned. "What about Haven? Laurana's expecting us."
You hold up the sending stone. "I can send another message tonight, let her 
know we're pursuing this directly with naval resources. She'll understand-it's 
the fastest way to neutralize the threat."
Within an hour, you have:
*	Three horses (courtesy of Aldric's party)
*	Provisions for the journey
*	The harbormaster's letter of introduction
*	All your evidence (maps, notes, trident, cursed items sealed in a 
watertight case)
The evacuation column begins moving toward Saltmere as you prepare to ride 
northeast.
Aldric clasps your hand. "End this. Those fishermen deserve justice, and our 
people deserve to come home."
You set out for Ak-Thyln. Ready to begin the journey, or is there 
anything else you want to do before leaving?
Go, times not a luxury
Dec 8
You mount up and ride.
The three of you push the horses hard, eating miles through the afternoon and 
into evening. The coastal road northeast is well-maintained-a trade route 
between settlements-but you're racing against time.
As night falls, you make camp briefly, tend the horses, and eat a cold meal. 
You pull out the sending stone.
Your message to Laurana: "Headed to Ak-Thyln naval garrison with sahuagin 
intelligence. Deep One threat requires immediate maritime response. Will 
coordinate with Admiral Kethren. Coastal villages safe. -Johannes"
The stone warms, then cools.
Laurana's response comes quickly: "Understood. Good tactical decision. I'll 
coordinate with Ak-Thyln through channels. Watch for Dragon Army presence 
there-it's contested territory. Stay safe. -Laurana"
A warning worth noting. Ak-Thyln is apparently in a strategic position.
You sleep in shifts, then ride again before dawn.
 
Three days of hard travel:
Day one: Coastal plains, passing fishing villages and farms Day two: Rolling 
hills, skirting the edge of a forest Day three: The land rises, and you smell salt 
air differently-a major port
As the sun sets on the third day, you crest a hill and see Ak-Thyln spread 
before you.
It's a proper city-stone walls, a massive harbor with dozens of ships, 
watchtowers, naval facilities. You can see warships at anchor, patrol boats in 
the harbor, and the distinctive architecture of maritime temples near the 
waterfront.
This is a city that takes the sea seriously.
You ride toward the main gates as twilight deepens.
How do you want to approach? Present yourselves at the naval 
garrison directly? Seek out the temples first? Use the 
harbormaster's letter of introduction?
Temple first, we need to understand what we're facing before going to the 
navy
Dec 8
Smart. Get the theological and magical expertise first, then bring that 
knowledge to the military.
You guide your horses through the gates-the guards barely glance at three 
tired travelers-and navigate through the evening streets toward the 
waterfront district.
The maritime temples are easy to find: a cluster of buildings near the docks, 
each dedicated to different sea deities. You see symbols of Habbakuk (sea 
animals and fishing), Zeboim (storms and chaos), and-most prominently-a 
large temple bearing the trident symbol of Kiri-Jolith's maritime aspect.
"There," Cyrus says, pointing to the Kiri-Jolith temple. "That's our best bet. 
My god has strong ties to honorable naval warfare and protection of the 
innocent. They'll take this seriously."
The temple is impressive-white stone, carved with waves and military 
imagery, clearly well-funded by naval donations. Guards stand at the entrance, 
but they're ceremonial rather than hostile.
You dismount and approach. One guard steps forward. "The temple is open 
for evening prayers. Do you seek counsel or sanctuary?"
"Counsel," Cyrus says, showing his holy symbol. "Brother Cyrus, cleric of Kiri-
Jolith. We bring urgent intelligence about a threat to the coastal waters. We 
need to speak with your senior clerics about sahuagin activity and something 
called the Deep One."
The guard's expression shifts from polite to alert. "Wait here."
He disappears inside. Two minutes later, a woman in her fifties emerges-
clearly a high-ranking cleric, wearing ceremonial robes with naval insignia.
"I am Captain-Cleric Thessa," she says, her voice carrying command authority. 
"You mentioned sahuagin and a Deep One?"
How do you present your case?
I defer to Cyrus
Dec 8
You step back slightly, giving Cyrus the floor. He's the cleric, this is his deity's 
temple-he'll have the credibility here.
Cyrus steps forward, showing his holy symbol prominently. "Captain-Cleric 
Thessa. I am Brother Cyrus, servant of Kiri-Jolith. Three days ago, we 
destroyed a sahuagin nest that was raiding coastal villages using enchantment 
magic to create thralls."
He gestures to you and Kessa. "My companions-Johannes Constantinius and 
Kessa Darrow. We killed a sahuagin chieftain and priestess, saved three 
villages from enslavement, and discovered intelligence suggesting a 
coordinated threat."
Thessa's eyes sharpen. "Come inside. Now."
She leads you through the temple into a private chamber-clearly a war room 
of sorts, with maps of the coastline covering the walls and a large table in the 
center.
"Show me everything," she says.
Cyrus spreads out the priestess's maps on the table. "Three coastal villages 
targeted. The sahuagin were planting cursed items-shells, masks, coins-that 
would enchant the wearers, prepare them for thralldom. We found ritual notes 
mentioning something called 'the Deep One' and references to when 'the stars 
align.'"
He points to the offshore marking. "This symbol appears to indicate 
something in deep water, roughly equidistant from all three villages. We 
believe it's the source-the Deep One itself, or its lair."
Thessa leans over the map, her expression growing grave. She traces the 
markings with her finger, then looks up sharply.
"How deep is this location?"
"Approximately 200 feet, based on the notations," you offer.
She curses quietly. "That's... troubling. Very troubling." She looks at Cyrus. 
"You said 'when the stars align.' Did the notes specify which stars? Any 
celestial references?"
What do you tell her? Do you have the actual notes to show her?
We have the notes and share everything.
Dec 8
You pull out the waterproof case containing the priestess's notes and ritual 
components. "We have the original documents. We can't read Sahuagin script 
fluently, but Brother Cyrus made out some of it through divine insight."
You spread the notes on the table-crude parchment treated to resist water, 
covered in the flowing, alien script of the sahuagin language.
Thessa examines them closely, her expression darkening with each page. "I 
can read some of this. Naval clerics study sahuagin dialects-know your enemy 
and all that."
She traces one passage with her finger, translating: "'The Deep One stirs in its 
temple... the stars move toward alignment... surface dwellers will serve or 
feed... the faithful gather strength...'"
She flips to another page. "Here: 'Three settlements marked for harvest... 
thralls prepared for the awakening... when Kh'leth rises, the coastlands will 
know their master...'"
She looks up, her face pale. "Kh'leth. That's not just 'Deep One'-that's 
a name. A specific entity." She moves to a locked cabinet, pulls out an ancient 
tome, and begins flipping through pages.
"Kh'leth the Drowned," she reads aloud. "An aboleth-an ancient aberration 
from before the Age of Dreams. The texts say it was bound beneath the waves 
by the gods themselves during the Second Dragon War."
Cyrus's face goes grim. "An aboleth. That explains the enchantment magic, the 
thrall-making."
Thessa continues reading: "Aboleths are masters of mental domination. 
They're as intelligent as dragons, far older, and they view all other beings as 
either slaves or food. They have psychic powers, can breathe water and air, 
and..." She pauses. "They can create permanent mind-controlled servants with 
their slime."
She looks at your evidence again-the cursed items, the maps, the ritual notes. 
"If Kh'leth is genuinely awakening, this is far worse than a sahuagin raiding 
problem. This is an existential threat to every coastal settlement within a 
hundred miles."
She looks at you three. "You destroyed one nest and saved three villages. But if 
the aboleth is truly stirring, those sahuagin were just the beginning. There 
could be dozens of nests, hundreds of thralls being prepared."
She sets down the tome with a heavy thud. "We need Admiral Kethren. We 
need the fleet. And we need to know exactly when these 'stars align.'"
What do you ask or say?
We serve the people. Tell us how to be of service
Dec 8
You meet Thessa's eyes directly. "We serve the people. Tell us how to be of 
service."
Thessa studies you for a moment-measuring, evaluating. Then she nods with 
the respect of one professional to another.
"First, you rest. You've ridden hard for three days and fought an underwater 
battle before that. Admiral Kethren won't see anyone until morning anyway-
he keeps strict schedules." She gestures to a side door. "The temple has guest 
quarters. Clean beds, hot food, and you can stable your horses here."
"Second," she continues, "I need to consult our astronomers and scholars 
about this 'star alignment.' If we can determine when Kh'leth plans to rise, 
we have a timeline to work with."
She taps the maps. "Third, at first light, we meet with Admiral Kethren. You 
present your evidence, I provide the theological and historical context, and we 
convince him to deploy naval resources against a threat most people think is 
myth."
"Fourth-and this is where you three come in specifically-if the Admiral 
approves action, we'll need people who've actually fought sahuagin recently. 
People who know their tactics, their magic, their weaknesses. People who can 
go back into those waters if needed."
She looks at each of you in turn. "The navy has ships and soldiers. The temple 
has divine magic and knowledge. But you have experience with this specific 
enemy. That makes you invaluable."
Cyrus nods solemnly. "We'll do what's needed."
Kessa asks, "What are the odds Kethren actually believes this and commits 
resources?"
Thessa smiles grimly. "With your evidence, my testimony, and the fact that 
sahuagin activity has been increasing along the coast for months? Better than 
you'd think. The Admiral's practical-he listens to facts and prepares for 
threats, even unlikely ones."
"Now," she says, "you look dead on your feet. Eat. Rest. We begin in earnest at 
dawn."
Do you rest, or is there anything else you want to do tonight?
Rest
Dec 9
A temple acolyte leads you to the guest quarters-simple but clean rooms with 
actual beds. Your horses are taken to the temple stables, fed and watered.
Hot food arrives: fish stew, fresh bread, and ale. After days of trail rations and 
cold camps, it tastes like a feast.
"Three villages saved, an aboleth to deal with," Kessa says, sitting heavily on 
her bunk. "When you said you wanted to help coastal towns, I thought we'd be 
dealing with bandits or maybe smugglers."
Cyrus removes his armor carefully. "Kiri-Jolith guides us where we're needed. 
Apparently we're needed here."
You collapse onto your bed, the Trident of Warning leaning against the wall 
within reach. Your body aches, but you're clean, fed, and safe.
Sleep comes quickly.
 
LONG REST
All HP, spell slots, and abilities fully restored Johannes: 66/66 HP, 2x 4th 
level spell slots Party fully rested and ready
 
You wake to morning light and the sound of ships' bells from the harbor. An 
acolyte knocks on your door.
"Captain-Cleric Thessa requests your presence. Admiral Kethren will see you 
within the hour. She says to bring all your evidence."
You dress, don your armor, collect your materials. The trident, the maps, the 
notes, the cursed items sealed in their case.
Cyrus looks resolute. Kessa checks her weapons with practiced efficiency.
"Time to convince a naval commander that an ancient aboleth is waking up," 
Kessa says dryly. "Should be an interesting morning."
Thessa meets you in the temple's main hall. "Ready? The Admiral's expecting 
us at the naval headquarters. Fair warning-he's skeptical by nature, but he's 
also seen enough strange things at sea to keep an open mind."
You head to meet Admiral Kethren. Ready to present your case?
Yes, I will let Cyrus lead on this.
Dec 9
Smart. Let the cleric of Kiri-Jolith-a god with strong naval connections-take 
the lead with a military commander.
 
The naval headquarters is an imposing stone fortress overlooking the harbor. 
Guards salute Thessa as she leads you through, clearly recognizing the 
Captain-Cleric's authority.
You're shown into a spacious office with large windows facing the sea. Charts 
and maps cover every wall. Behind a heavy desk sits Admiral Kethren-a 
man in his sixties, weathered by decades at sea, with sharp eyes that miss 
nothing.
He stands as you enter. "Captain-Cleric Thessa. And guests." His gaze sweeps 
over you three, assessing. "You said this was urgent."
"It is, Admiral," Thessa says. "These are Brother Cyrus of Kiri-Jolith, and his 
companions Johannes Constantinius and Kessa Darrow. Three days ago they 
destroyed a sahuagin nest and uncovered intelligence about a coordinated 
threat to our coastline."
Kethren gestures to chairs. "Sit. Show me what you have."
Cyrus steps forward, placing the evidence on the Admiral's desk with military 
precision. "Admiral, we were investigating attacks on three coastal villages-
Saltmere, Beacon's Rest, and Driftwood Cove. Villagers were being enchanted 
through cursed items, prepared for enslavement."
He spreads out the maps. "We tracked the sahuagin to their nest, engaged and 
destroyed their leadership-a chieftain and priestess. In their lair, we found 
these documents."
Cyrus presents the ritual notes, the maps with marked villages, the offshore 
symbol. "The sahuagin were acting under orders from an entity they called 
Kh'leth. Captain-Cleric Thessa has identified this as an aboleth-specifically, 
one that was supposedly bound centuries ago."
Kethren leans forward, studying the maps intently. His expression is 
unreadable.
Cyrus continues steadily. "The notes reference 'when the stars align' and 
preparing thralls for an 'awakening.' Three villages were targeted 
systematically. We believe there's a central location approximately five to six 
miles offshore, in deep water."
He gestures to you. "Johannes engaged the sahuagin chieftain in underwater 
combat and retrieved this." You place the electric trident on the desk.
Thessa adds her voice. "Admiral, I've translated the ritual texts. This matches 
historical accounts of aboleth activity-mental domination, thrall preparation, 
coordinated strikes. The references to Kh'leth specifically appear in pre-
Cataclysm records."
Kethren is silent for a long moment, examining each piece of evidence. Finally, 
he looks up.
"How many sahuagin did you kill?"
"Approximately fifteen warriors, one chieftain, one priestess," Cyrus answers 
precisely. "Several juveniles and additional warriors escaped into deeper 
waters."
"And the three villages?"
"Evacuated inland. No casualties from the raids. We provided warning in 
time."
Kethren nods slowly. "I've been receiving reports for months-increased 
sahuagin sightings, missing fishing boats, strange sounds in deep water. My 
captains thought it was seasonal migration." He taps the map. "This suggests 
otherwise."
He looks at Thessa. "Your assessment, Captain-Cleric? Professional opinion."
"The threat is real, Admiral. Whether it's truly an ancient aboleth awakening 
or something else, these sahuagin are organized, equipped with magic, and 
targeting coastal populations systematically. Left unchecked, this spreads."
Kethren stands, moving to look out at his harbor full of ships. "If I commit 
naval resources to this-ships, marines, mages-I need a target. Not just 
'somewhere offshore.' I need coordinates, depth, a plan of attack."
He turns back. "What exactly are you proposing?"
Cyrus looks to you and Thessa. What's the proposal?
Thessa? I wouldn't know where to begin
Dec 9
You look to Thessa. "I wouldn't know where to begin. This is your expertise."
Thessa steps forward, moving to the map. "Admiral, here's what I propose-a 
three-phase operation:"
"Phase One: Reconnaissance and Confirmation"
"We need to verify the location and assess the threat. I recommend a naval 
vessel equipped with diving capabilities and magical support-clerics who can 
cast Water Breathing, diviners who can scry or detect large concentrations of 
aberrant life. We sail to these coordinates," she taps the offshore marking, 
"and confirm what's down there."
"If it's truly an aboleth or a major nest, we map it, count forces, identify 
defenses. No engagement-pure intelligence gathering."
"Phase Two: Consultation and Preparation"
"Once we know what we're facing, we coordinate with the coastal temples, 
request specialized resources-perhaps paladins trained in fighting 
aberrations, mages with experience against psychic threats, equipment that 
protects against mental domination. This isn't a normal naval engagement."
"Phase Three: Assault or Containment"
"Depending on what we find: either a coordinated strike to eliminate the 
threat, or-if Kh'leth is truly as powerful as the legends suggest-we 
implement containment measures. Magical wards, divine barriers, permanent 
naval patrols. Prevent it from spreading until we can gather enough force to 
deal with it permanently."
She looks at Kethren directly. "The immediate action is Phase One. One ship, 
small but capable crew, magical support. Three to five days for 
reconnaissance. Low risk, high intelligence value."
Kethren considers this. "And these three?" He gestures to you, Cyrus, and 
Kessa. "What role do they play?"
Thessa doesn't hesitate. "They've fought sahuagin in close combat and won. 
They have experience with the enemy's tactics and magic. They know what to 
look for. I'd want them on the reconnaissance vessel as combat specialists and 
advisors."
Kethren looks at you three. "You've already done your part-saved three 
villages, brought us this intelligence. I can't order civilians into a dangerous 
naval operation. But if you're volunteering..."
He lets the question hang.
What do you say?
We've had plenty of chances to back out if that's what we wanted. We're good 
men, and women, in a storm, sir. We'll do what's need.
Dec 9
You meet Kethren's eyes steadily. "We've had plenty of chances to back out if 
that's what we wanted. We're good men, and women, in a storm, sir. We'll do 
what's needed."
Kethren studies you for a long moment, then nods with evident respect. 
"Spoken like someone who's seen real combat. Good."
He moves to his desk and pulls out a chart of the coastal waters. "Here's what I 
can commit immediately: The Stormbreaker-a fast sloop, thirty crew, 
experienced captain. She's equipped for deep-water operations and has 
reinforced diving capabilities."
He looks at Thessa. "I'll assign Captain Meredith Andra-she's my best for 
unconventional operations and she's worked with temple mages before. For 
magical support?"
Thessa responds, "I'll go myself, along with two acolytes trained in water 
magic and divination. We can provide Water Breathing, protection spells, and 
detection capabilities."
"Good," Kethren says. He looks at you three. "You'll be listed as civilian 
specialists attached to temple personnel. That gives you official status without 
putting you in the naval chain of command. Captain Andra has final authority 
on the ship, but you report directly to Captain-Cleric Thessa regarding the 
mission objectives."
He begins marking the chart. "Here's your reconnaissance zone-five to six 
miles offshore, deep water. You survey, you assess, you report back. You do 
NOT engage unless absolutely necessary for survival. Clear?"
"Clear," Cyrus confirms.
"The Stormbreaker can be ready to sail by tomorrow's morning tide. That 
gives you today to prepare, coordinate with Thessa's team, and acquire any 
specialized equipment you might need." He pauses. "The naval quartermaster 
can provide standard diving equipment, rope, lights, weapons suitable for 
underwater work. Anything beyond that, coordinate with the temple."
He stands, extending his hand to Cyrus first, then you and Kessa. "You're 
doing a service to every soul living on this coast. Whatever's down there, we'll 
face it together."
Thessa adds, "Meet me at the temple at midday. We'll go over magical 
preparations, diving protocols, and what to expect if we encounter an aboleth 
or its servants."
You have the rest of today to prepare for tomorrow's 
reconnaissance mission. What do you want to do?
Kessa, Cyrus? Thoughts. Is like to know everything about aboleths and what 
were getting ourselves into.
Dec 9
You turn to your companions. "Kessa, Cyrus? Thoughts. I'd like to know 
everything about aboleths and what we're getting ourselves into."
Kessa leans against the wall, arms crossed. "I know the basics-ancient, 
tentacled nightmares that live in deep water and enslave minds. But I'm a 
rogue, not a scholar. If we're swimming into an aboleth's lair, I want to know: 
How do you kill one? What protects against their mental attacks? What 
happens if they do get in your head?"
Cyrus nods grimly. "I know more from temple teachings, but this is beyond my 
experience. Aboleths are mentioned in the oldest texts-pre-Cataclysm 
warnings about things that should stay buried. They're not like dragons or 
demons. They're... alien. Their minds work differently. Their goals are 
incomprehensible."
He looks at you. "Your Ring of Mind Shielding will protect you from mental 
intrusion, but Kessa and I don't have that defense. We need to know if there 
are spells, items, or techniques that can shield us."
Kessa adds, "And tactically-can we even hurt one? Are they like the sahuagin 
where normal weapons work, or do we need magic? What about their lair-do 
they have specific defenses, servants beyond the sahuagin?"
"Also," Cyrus says, "the 'stars aligning' reference. Thessa mentioned consulting 
astronomers. We need to know our timeline. Are we talking days, weeks, 
months before whatever Kh'leth is planning?"
Kessa straightens. "So here's what I'm thinking for today: We hit the temple 
library hard. Learn everything about aboleths-their abilities, weaknesses, 
tactics. Then we talk to Thessa about magical protections we can get. Finally, 
we check with the naval quartermaster about specialized equipment."
She looks at you both. "Split up to cover more ground, or stick together?"
What's your plan for the day?
Stick together
Dec 9
"Stick together," you say. "We're a team, and we all need to know the same 
information. No point in one of us learning something critical that the others 
miss."
Kessa nods. "Agreed. Let's start with the temple library-get the full picture on 
aboleths. Then we talk to Thessa about protections and preparations."
 
TEMPLE OF KIRI-JOLITH - LIBRARY
The temple's library is extensive-centuries of naval records, theological texts, 
and accounts of maritime threats. An elderly scholar-priest named Brother 
Aldwyn helps you search.
"Aboleths," he says, pulling down ancient tomes. "Terrible creatures. Let me 
find the relevant texts..."
Over the next several hours, you learn disturbing truths:
ABOLETH CAPABILITIES:
*	Physical: Twenty feet long, eel-like body with four tentacles. Can 
survive in water or air (though prefer water)
*	Mental Powers: Telepathy up to 120 feet, can enslave creatures who 
fail to resist (permanent mental domination through mucus contact)
*	Psychic Attacks: Can project psychic assaults that damage minds 
directly
*	Ancient Memory: Perfect recall stretching back millennia-they 
literally remember the world before gods
*	Magic: Natural spellcasting ability, typically illusion and enchantment 
magic
*	Lair Actions: In their lairs, they control water currents, create 
phantasmal images, and can probe minds of creatures nearby
WEAKNESSES:
*	Vulnerable to psychic protection magic (Mind Blank, Protection from 
Evil and Good, etc.)
*	Can be killed through sufficient physical damage (they're not immortal, 
just ancient)
*	Require water or moisture-dry environments weaken them 
significantly
*	Overconfident due to their age and power-can be tactically 
outmaneuvered
THE MUCUS:
This is particularly concerning. Aboleth skin secretes mucus that transforms 
breathing creatures. One touch, and if you fail to resist:
*	You can breathe water but NOT air
*	Lasts for hours or until treated with Lesser Restoration
*	Makes surface escape impossible without magical healing
THRALLS:
Creatures enslaved by aboleths become permanent servants unless freed 
by Greater Restoration or the aboleth's death. The enslaved retain their 
abilities but serve the aboleth absolutely.
Brother Aldwyn looks grave. "The texts say aboleths view themselves as the 
rightful rulers of the world. They remember when they dominated the 
primordial oceans, before gods or dragons. Their plans span centuries. If 
Kh'leth is awakening, it's been planning this for longer than our civilization 
has existed."
Kessa's face is pale. "So if it touches us with that mucus and we can't breathe 
air anymore..."
"You drown on the ship unless someone casts Lesser Restoration," Cyrus 
finishes grimly.
You unconsciously touch your Ring of Mind Shielding. At least you're 
protected from the mental domination.
What do you ask or investigate next?
Kessa? Cyrus?
Dec 9
Kessa speaks first, her tactical mind working. "Alright, so the mucus is a death 
sentence without magical healing. Cyrus, you can cast Lesser Restoration, 
right? How many times?"
Cyrus calculates. "I can prepare it, yes. At my level, I have multiple spell slots 
for it. But in combat, underwater, if multiple people get hit..." He doesn't 
finish, but the implication is clear-he might not be able to save everyone fast 
enough.
"We need backup healing," Kessa says. "Potions, scrolls, whatever Thessa's 
acolytes can provide. And we need a clear protocol: if someone gets mucus-
touched, they surface immediately while they can still breathe air, get healed 
before the transformation completes."
She taps the book showing aboleth illustrations. "The mental domination-
Johannes, your ring protects you. But Cyrus and I are vulnerable. What 
protections can we get? Thessa mentioned she'd have spells."
Cyrus nods. "I can prepare Protection from Evil and Good-it would shield 
one person from aberrations, including their charm and domination effects. 
But I can only maintain one at a time, and it requires concentration."
"So one of us is protected, one isn't," Kessa says flatly. "That's not great odds."
Brother Aldwyn interjects. "The temple may have blessed amulets or items 
that provide resistance to mental effects. Also, Calm Emotions can suppress 
charm effects temporarily if someone does get dominated."
Cyrus looks thoughtful. "There's also the option of divine buffs before we 
descend-Bless, Aid, anything that improves our mental resilience. Every 
advantage helps."
Kessa turns to you. "Here's my concern: we're planning a reconnaissance 
mission, but if Kh'leth is as intelligent as these texts say, it's not going to 
just let us scout its lair. It'll know we're coming. It might set traps, ambushes, 
or try to capture us for thralls."
She's right. An ancient, hyper-intelligent aberration won't be caught off-guard 
easily.
"So what's our real plan?" Kessa asks. "Do we try to approach stealthily? Go in 
fast and aggressive? Have an exit strategy if things go sideways?"
What's your thinking?
I an always one for stealth
Dec 9
"I'm always one for stealth," you say. "We've survived this long by not 
announcing ourselves. If Kh'leth is as ancient and intelligent as these texts 
say, direct confrontation plays to its strengths-it's had millennia to prepare 
defenses."
Kessa nods approvingly. "Agreed. Reconnaissance means staying undetected. 
Get in, observe, map what we can, get out without being noticed."
Cyrus considers. "Stealth underwater is challenging. Water carries sound 
differently, visibility is limited, and we'll be in the aboleth's element. But it's 
still our best approach."
You think through the tactical elements. "My One with Shadows invocation 
works in darkness or dim light-which deep water definitely qualifies as. I can 
turn invisible as long as I stay in shadow. That's our scout capability right 
there."
"The Cloak of the Manta Ray gives you swimming speed and water breathing," 
Kessa adds. "You're built for underwater infiltration. Cyrus and I..." She 
pauses. "We're less stealthy in water. I'm decent on land, but underwater?"
Cyrus nods. "I'm armored and carry a mace. Not exactly subtle in the water."
You lean forward. "So here's what I'm thinking: layered approach. I go ahead 
as scout-invisible, silent, mobile in water. You two follow at a distance with 
Thessa's group, ready to provide support or retreat if I signal danger. If I can 
map the lair without engaging, we get intelligence without risk."
"And if you get caught?" Kessa asks pointedly.
"Then I use Misty Step or Dimension Door to extract myself, and we abort the 
mission," you reply. "No heroics, no fighting an aboleth in its lair alone. Scout, 
report, extract."
Cyrus looks relieved. "That's sensible. Proper military reconnaissance-you're 
the scout element, we're the support element, everyone has defined roles and 
fallback positions."
Brother Aldwyn, who's been listening, adds: "You'll want continual light 
sources that don't require hands-perhaps enchanted stones or alchemical 
solutions. And communication underwater is difficult. You'll need pre-
arranged signals."
Kessa nods. "Hand signals for close range, maybe colored flares for distance. 
And a strict time limit-if Johannes isn't back within X minutes, we assume 
compromise and withdraw."
This sounds like a solid plan. What else do you want to prepare or 
clarify before meeting with Thessa?
I have Devil's Sight and Cyrus has the Goggles of Night. Light detection is our 
biggest problems. Are there any telepathic communication options?
Dec 9
"Wait," you say. "I have Devil's Sight-I can see in magical darkness out to 120 
feet. And Cyrus has the Goggles of Night. Light detection is actually our 
biggest problem. If we're carrying light sources, we're announcing ourselves to 
everything down there."
Cyrus nods. "The goggles let me see in darkness as if it were daylight, up to 60 
feet. So between us, we have excellent dark vision capabilities."
"But Kessa doesn't," you point out. "And if Thessa's acolytes need light..."
Kessa grimaces. "I'm half-elven-I have darkvision out to 60 feet naturally. 
Not as good as magical sight, but I can navigate in darkness. The real question 
is whether Thessa and her people can operate without light."
Brother Aldwyn considers. "Most humans don't have darkvision. The temple 
acolytes would need either magical darkvision or light sources. But you raise a 
good point about detection."
You continue. "The other issue: communication underwater. Hand signals 
work at close range, but if I'm scouting ahead invisibly and spot something, 
how do I warn you? Are there any telepathic communication options? Magic 
items, spells, anything?"
Brother Aldwyn's eyes light up. "Ah! Yes, actually. The spell Telepathic Bond-
it links multiple creatures telepathically for hours. Unfortunately, it's 5th level 
magic. None of the temple clerics here can cast it."
He thinks further. "There are magic items-Rings of Telepathy, Sending 
Stones like you have, but those are rare and specific. However..." He pulls 
down another tome. "There's a lesser version: Message cantrip. Short range, 
but it allows whispered communication at a distance."
Cyrus shakes his head. "I don't have Message prepared, and it's not something 
I can pick up quickly."
"What about the acolytes Thessa mentioned?" Kessa asks. "Maybe one of them 
has communication magic?"
"Worth asking," you agree. "This is critical-if we can't communicate silently 
underwater, the stealth approach falls apart."
Brother Aldwyn adds, "There's also mundane options: pre-arranged signals 
using colored smoke or dye in the water, bioluminescent algae that can be 
activated, or even trained sea creatures that respond to commands. The naval 
forces may have protocols for this."
You should definitely raise this with Thessa when you meet at 
midday. Anything else you want to research or prepare here in the 
library?
Any legends or myths about the aboleth?
Dec 9
"Any legends or myths about this specific aboleth-Kh'leth?" you ask Brother 
Aldwyn. "Or aboleths in general? Sometimes myths contain useful truths."
Brother Aldwyn's expression grows thoughtful. "Let me check the older 
archives..."
He disappears into the deeper stacks, returning with several ancient, salt-
stained texts. "These are pre-Cataclysm maritime records and oral traditions 
compiled by coastal temples."
Over the next hour, he shares what he finds:
KHLETH THE DROWNED - SPECIFIC LEGENDS:
"There are fragmentary references to Kh'leth in texts from before the 
Cataclysm. It was supposedly one of the 'Deep Ancients'-aboleths that ruled 
vast underwater domains when the world was young."
He reads from a crumbling manuscript: "'Kh'leth of the Drowning City 
commanded legions of the scaled ones and built temples in the lightless 
depths. When the gods rose, they bound the Deep Ancients beneath stone and 
spell, that the surface world might flourish.'"
"Another account," he continues, flipping pages, "mentions that Kh'leth was 
bound beneath what was then called 'the Kraken's Shelf'-a deep ocean trench. 
The binding required the combined power of three sea deities and a sacrifice 
of... well, the text is damaged here."
ABOLETH GENERAL MYTHS:
"The most consistent legend across cultures: aboleths never truly sleep, and 
they never forget. Every slight, every defeat, every prisoner that escaped-they 
remember and plan revenge across centuries."
"Another common thread: aboleths hate the gods. They view divine beings as 
usurpers who stole the world from its rightful ancient rulers. Any mention of 
gods or divine power enrages them."
He shows you an illustration-a crude but disturbing image of an aboleth 
surrounded by enslaved humanoids. "They collect thralls obsessively. Some 
legends say they're building armies for when 'the stars return to their ancient 
positions' and the bindings weaken."
"The 'stars aligning' reference in the sahuagin notes," Cyrus murmurs. "That's 
not metaphorical. It's literal-an astronomical event that weakens divine 
bindings."
Brother Aldwyn nods grimly. "There are celestial events-conjunctions, 
alignments-that occur in cycles. If Kh'leth's binding was tied to stellar 
positions..." He doesn't finish, but the implication is clear.
ABOLETH WEAKNESSES IN MYTH:
"Few cultures defeated aboleths in direct combat. Those who succeeded either 
had divine intervention or..." he pauses, reading carefully, "exploited the 
aboleth's arrogance. One account describes sailors who pretended to be 
enslaved, then struck when the aboleth was distracted by its own gloating."
"Another legend mentions that aboleths despise their own mucus being used 
against them-apparently there are rare instances of the transformation being 
reversed or weaponized."
"And this is interesting," he taps a passage. "Several accounts mention that 
damaging an aboleth's lair-destroying its collected treasures, its thralls, its 
carefully constructed domain-enrages it so thoroughly that it makes tactical 
mistakes."
WARNINGS:
"Every account that mentions someone descending into an aboleth's lair ends 
one of three ways: the heroes don't return, they return enslaved, or they 
return... changed. Traumatized by what they witnessed. Aboleths don't just 
dominate minds-they show victims their true vision of reality, millions of 
years of alien memory."
He closes the book soberly. "The texts all agree: never underestimate an 
aboleth's patience or intelligence. They think in centuries. Whatever you see in 
that lair, whatever Kh'leth has prepared-it's been planning it longer than 
your entire civilization has existed."
Kessa swallows hard. "Encouraging."
Cyrus looks at you. "Your ring protects you from mental intrusion. But these 
'visions'-if they're not direct domination but just... showing you things... I 
don't know if that's covered."
It's approaching midday. Time to meet with Thessa. Is there 
anything else you want to know or prepare before heading there?
How might the mucus be turnedagainst an aboleth?
Dec 9
"Wait," you say, stopping Brother Aldwyn before he closes the tome. "You 
mentioned the mucus being turned against an aboleth. How? That seems like 
critical tactical information."
Brother Aldwyn flips back through the pages, squinting at the faded text. "Ah, 
here it is. This is from an account dated approximately 800 years pre-
Cataclysm, from a coastal nation that no longer exists..."
He reads carefully: "'The creature's own slime proved its undoing. When the 
brave captain forced the beast's tentacle against its own flesh, the 
transformation curse took hold. The aboleth, master of water, found itself 
choking on air it could no longer expel from its form.'"
He looks up. "The implication is that aboleths are not immune to their own 
mucus transformation. If you could somehow get their mucus onto them-
force a tentacle against their body, redirect their own attack-they'd transform 
to air-breathing and suffocate underwater."
Kessa leans forward intently. "That's... actually brilliant. They weaponize 
drowning against surface dwellers. We weaponize drowning against them."
"But it would require getting into melee range," Cyrus cautions. "Close enough 
to physically manipulate a tentacle. That puts you within reach of mental 
domination."
"Not me," you say, touching your Ring of Mind Shielding. "I'm protected. If 
anyone's going to try this, it's me."
Brother Aldwyn continues reading. "There's a warning here though: 'The 
attempt cost three warriors their lives before success. The beast fought with 
terrible fury when it realized the danger, thrashing and using its thralls as 
shields.'"
He finds another passage. "Here's an alternate account-from a sea elf tribe. 
They apparently collected aboleth mucus in sealed vials after a battle, then 
used it as a weapon in a later encounter. Coating their spears with it, then 
striking the aboleth. Each hit had a chance to trigger the transformation."
"Weaponized mucus," Kessa says thoughtfully. "If we could get samples from 
the dead sahuagin or from the lair itself... coat arrows, blades, harpoons..."
"That's assuming the mucus remains potent when stored," Cyrus points out. 
"And that we can safely handle it without contaminating ourselves. But it's 
worth asking Thessa about."
Brother Aldwyn closes the book. "It's a risky tactic either way. You'd 
essentially be trying to turn the aboleth's deadliest weapon against it while 
fighting in its domain. But if you could make it work..." He shakes his head in 
wonder. "Drowning a creature that's ruled underwater for millennia. There's a 
certain poetic justice to it."
It's now midday. You should head to meet Thessa. This mucus 
reversal tactic is definitely worth discussing with her.
Anything else before you go?
Nope
Dec 9
You thank Brother Aldwyn for his help and head to meet Thessa at the 
designated meeting room in the temple.
Captain-Cleric Thessa is waiting with two younger clerics-both human, 
probably in their twenties, wearing practical maritime vestments.
"Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa," Thessa greets you. "These are Acolytes Maren and 
Donal. They'll be accompanying us on the Stormbreaker. Maren specializes in 
divination and water magic. Donal is trained in healing and protection spells."
Both acolytes nod respectfully.
Thessa spreads out a chart on the table. "Let's discuss the mission parameters. 
Tomorrow at dawn, we sail to these coordinates. The journey will take 
approximately four to five hours depending on wind. Once we're positioned, 
we'll begin reconnaissance."
She looks at each of you. "I understand from Brother Aldwyn that you've been 
researching aboleths. Good. What questions or concerns do you have about 
tomorrow's operation?"
Kessa speaks first. "Communication underwater. If Johannes is scouting 
ahead invisibly and spots danger, how does he warn us silently? Do any of 
your acolytes have telepathic or silent communication magic?"
What else do you want to discuss with Thessa? The mucus reversal 
tactic? Protection from mental domination? Equipment needs? The 
timeline for the stellar alignment?
All of the above
Dec 9
Kessa's question about communication hangs in the air. You add, "And we 
have several other critical concerns we need to address."
Thessa nods. "Let's go through them systematically."
COMMUNICATION:
Maren, the divination specialist, speaks up. "I have the Message cantrip 
prepared. I can create a whispered magical link to anyone I can see within 120 
feet. It's not true telepathy, but it allows silent communication underwater."
"That works for close-range coordination," you say. "But if I'm scouting ahead 
invisibly-"
"Then we establish check-in intervals," Thessa interrupts. "Every ten minutes, 
you return to visual range and Maren messages you. If you miss a check-in, we 
assume compromise and begin withdrawal protocols."
Cyrus nods. "Standard reconnaissance procedure. That works."
PROTECTION FROM MENTAL DOMINATION:
"The aboleth's mental attacks," you continue. "I'm protected by my Ring of 
Mind Shielding, but Cyrus and Kessa are vulnerable. What can we do?"
Thessa considers. "I can cast Protection from Evil and Good on one person-it 
grants advantage on saves against aberrations and prevents their charm and 
fear effects. Cyrus, you mentioned you can prepare it as well?"
"Yes," Cyrus confirms. "So that's two people protected-Kessa and one other."
Donal adds, "I'll have Calm Emotions prepared, which can suppress ongoing 
charm effects on multiple targets if someone does get dominated. Not 
prevention, but damage control."
"There's also divine buffs before we descend," Thessa says. "Bless improves 
saving throws, Aid increases maximum hit points and resilience. We layer 
defenses-make it harder for the aboleth to succeed, and have responses ready 
if it does."
THE MUCUS REVERSAL TACTIC:
You lean forward. "Brother Aldwyn mentioned something interesting in the 
old texts-aboleth mucus being turned against them. Forcing their own 
tentacles against their body, or coating weapons with collected mucus to 
trigger the air-breathing transformation in them."
Thessa's eyebrows rise. "That's... actually documented? I've heard rumors but 
never confirmed accounts."
"Multiple sources," Cyrus confirms. "Pre-Cataclysm records from different 
cultures. The aboleth transforms to air-breathing and suffocates underwater."
Thessa looks genuinely intrigued. "That would be devastating if we could pull 
it off. The challenge is getting mucus samples without contaminating 
ourselves, then applying it in combat."
Maren speaks up. "We could prepare sealed vials with Mage Hand to collect 
samples remotely. Coat weapons before engagement. But it's incredibly risky-
one mistake and whoever's handling it gets transformed."
"I'd be the one attempting it," you say. "I'm protected from mental domination 
and have the best underwater mobility. If I can get close enough to redirect a 
tentacle attack or deliver a mucus-coated strike..."
"It's a desperation tactic," Thessa says firmly. "Last resort if we're forced into 
combat. But worth preparing for." She makes a note. "We'll bring collection 
vials and coating materials. Maren can handle the mucus remotely if we get 
samples."
EQUIPMENT NEEDS:
"Beyond the mucus collection kit," Kessa says, "what else should we 
requisition from the naval quartermaster?"
Thessa consults a list. "Underwater combat requires specialized equipment:
*	Weighted belts for maintaining depth control
*	Diving knives for cutting through kelp, nets, or tentacles
*	Signal flares (waterproof) for emergency communication
*	Rope and grappling gear for navigating underwater terrain
*	Sealed containers for specimen collection
*	Healing potions distributed among the team
The quartermaster will have standard naval diving gear. Is there anything 
specific you need beyond that?"
"Backup light sources," Cyrus says. "Even though most of us have darkvision, 
we need contingency lighting for emergencies."
"Agreed," Thessa says. "Alchemical lights, shielded so they can be concealed 
when needed."
THE STELLAR ALIGNMENT TIMELINE:
"The 'stars aligning' reference in the sahuagin notes," you say. "Have your 
astronomers determined when this happens?"
Thessa's expression darkens. "Yes. And it's not good news. There's a rare 
planetary conjunction occurring in approximately three weeks. Five celestial 
bodies will align in a configuration that hasn't occurred in over a thousand 
years-roughly matching the timeframe of Kh'leth's binding."
Three weeks. That's your timeline.
"If the binding weakens during that conjunction," Thessa continues, "Kh'leth 
will be at its strongest. And if it's been preparing thralls and forces for this 
moment..." She doesn't finish, but the implication is clear.
"So reconnaissance tomorrow isn't just intelligence gathering," Kessa says 
slowly. "It's assessing whether we have time for a proper assault, or if we need 
to act immediately."
"Exactly," Thessa confirms. "If Kh'leth is already strong enough to break free, 
we might need Admiral Kethren to authorize immediate military action. If the 
binding still holds but is weakening, we have a brief window to strengthen it or 
eliminate the threat."
She looks at all of you. "This reconnaissance mission just became much more 
urgent. We're not just scouting-we're determining if we have three weeks or 
three days."
Anything else you need to address before tomorrow's departure?
Cyrus? Kessa? Underwater weapons? Especially underwater ranged weapons?
Dec 9
You look to your companions. "Cyrus? Kessa? What about weapons? 
Especially underwater ranged weapons-Kessa, your crossbow won't work, 
and even your bow will be severely limited."
Kessa nods. "I've been thinking about that. Crossbow bolts are useless 
underwater-the resistance kills their velocity. Regular bows work poorly 
unless specially designed. I need alternatives."
Thessa gestures to Donal. "Show them."
Donal opens a chest, revealing specialized equipment. "Naval combat gear. We 
have:
For ranged combat underwater:
*	Harpoons and javelins - weighted for throwing underwater, effective 
up to 20-30 feet
*	Nets - weighted, for entangling opponents
*	Spearguns (mechanical) - crude but functional, better range than 
thrown weapons
For melee:
*	Tridents and spears - piercing weapons work best underwater
*	Short swords and daggers - slashing still works but less effectively
*	Weighted maces - bludgeoning actually works fine due to water 
resistance helping momentum"
Kessa picks up a harpoon, testing the weight. "I'm trained with spears and 
javelins. This could work. Not as good as my bow, but functional."
"I already have the chieftain's trident," you note. "It's actually designed for 
underwater combat."
Cyrus examines a naval mace. "My regular mace should work fine. 
Bludgeoning weapons don't suffer penalties underwater like slashing does."
Thessa adds, "There's also the option of Create Water or Control Water spells 
for battlefield manipulation, but those are more defensive. For actual weapon 
selection-"
She looks at Kessa specifically. "You mentioned you're half-elven. What's your 
Dexterity?"
"Eighteen," Kessa replies.
"Then I'd recommend multiple javelins for ranged attacks, and keep your 
short sword for close combat. Javelins are versatile-you can throw them or 
use them as melee spears."
Maren adds, "I can cast Magic Weapon if needed, to give temporary magical 
properties to mundane weapons. Especially useful if we encounter creatures 
resistant to non-magical attacks."
Cyrus looks thoughtful. "What about underwater movement? Are we all 
swimming normally, or are there enhancements?"
"Water Breathing gives you the ability to breathe but doesn't improve 
swimming speed," Thessa explains. "However, Johannes has the Cloak of the 
Manta Ray which gives him a swim speed. The rest of us will be slower-
roughly half our normal land movement speed in water unless we have 
swimming training."
"I'm a decent swimmer," Kessa says. "Years of practice. But I won't be as 
mobile as Johannes."
"Which is why Johannes scouts ahead and we follow at a careful distance," 
Cyrus says.
You notice something. "Wait-Cyrus, you're wearing chain mail. Won't that 
sink you like a stone?"
Cyrus looks uncomfortable. "That's... actually a good point. Heavy armor 
underwater is problematic."
Thessa nods. "You'll need to switch to lighter armor for this mission. The 
quartermaster has studded leather that should fit. It's a sacrifice in AC, but 
drowning because you can't swim is worse."
Donal adds, "I'll be wearing padded cloth armor for the same reason. Mobility 
over protection in this environment."
Any other equipment or preparation concerns?
Anyone?
Dec 9
Kessa speaks up. "One more thing-escape plans. If this goes sideways and 
we're 200 feet down in an aboleth's lair, what's our extraction protocol?"
"Good question," Thessa says. "Ascending too quickly from that depth causes 
problems-the bends, pressure sickness. Normally you'd need staged 
decompression stops."
"However," Maren adds, "magical Water Breathing bypasses some of those 
issues since you're not breathing compressed air. But rapid ascent is still 
dangerous-you risk lung damage, disorientation."
"So if we need to flee quickly?" Kessa presses.
Thessa considers. "Emergency ascent: swim up as fast as you can, accept the 
consequences, and we treat injuries on the surface. Donal and I will have 
healing magic ready. Better injured than enslaved or dead."
Cyrus adds, "Johannes has Dimension Door-he can teleport 500 feet 
instantly. That's a direct escape to the surface if needed."
"For the rest of us," Thessa says, "we stay together, fight our way to open water 
if necessary, and ascend as a group. No one gets left behind."
She looks at each of you seriously. "If the aboleth appears and engages 
directly, we do NOT fight it. We retreat immediately. This is reconnaissance, 
not assassination. Clear?"
Everyone nods.
Donal speaks quietly. "What if someone gets enslaved? The mucus contact, the 
mental domination-what if Kh'leth captures one of us?"
Heavy silence.
"Then we extract whoever we can," Thessa says grimly, "and we return with 
overwhelming force to free them. But we don't sacrifice everyone trying to 
save one person in the moment. That's cold, but that's tactical reality."
Kessa looks at you and Cyrus. "We all understand the risks. We're going 
anyway. But let's be smart about it."
Cyrus nods solemnly. "Agreed."
Anything else, or are you ready to wrap up preparations and get 
final gear from the quartermaster before tomorrow's dawn 
departure?
Let's go... though I might mention the possibility that this partnership might 
lead to possible alliances with Haven and the resistance.
Dec 9
Before everyone disperses, you speak up. "Captain-Cleric Thessa, Admiral 
Kethren-there's something else worth mentioning."
Thessa pauses, attentive.
"This partnership-Ak-Thyln's naval forces working with us-could extend 
beyond this immediate threat. I'm associated with the resistance movement at 
Haven, under Commander Laurana Brightblade. We've been conducting 
operations against the Dragon Army in the region."
Thessa's expression sharpens with interest. Kethren, who's been observing 
from the doorway, steps forward.
"Haven's resistance," Kethren says slowly. "We've heard reports. Pax Tharkas 
liberation, wasn't it? Freed hundreds of prisoners?"
"Seven hundred," you confirm. "And multiple other successful operations. The 
resistance is growing, organized, and effective. But we're primarily land-based. 
Naval support, coastal coordination, intelligence sharing-these could benefit 
both our organizations."
Thessa exchanges a glance with Kethren. "Ak-Thyln has been... cautious about 
the Dragon Army situation. We're a port city-we rely on trade. Open alliance 
with a resistance movement could make us a target."
"Agreed," Kethren says. "But covert cooperation? Intelligence sharing about 
Dragon Army naval movements, coordinated strikes on coastal targets, mutual 
support against shared threats like this aboleth situation?" He considers. 
"That has potential."
"The resistance has proven competent," Thessa adds. "If they accomplished 
Pax Tharkas with the forces available to them, they're worth taking seriously."
Kethren nods slowly. "Let's deal with Kh'leth first. But afterward, if you're 
willing to facilitate introductions between Ak-Thyln and Haven's leadership... 
I think Admiral Brightblade and I should have a conversation."
"Commander Brightblade," you correct gently.
"Commander," Kethren acknowledges. "Even better-she understands she's 
building something, not just leading raids. That's the kind of leadership that 
wins wars."
He extends his hand. "Survive tomorrow's mission. Bring back actionable 
intelligence. Then we'll talk about what Ak-Thyln and Haven can do for each 
other."
You shake his hand firmly.
 
The rest of the day is spent at the naval quartermaster:
*	Kessa gets four javelins and keeps her short sword
*	Cyrus switches to studded leather armor (reluctantly)
*	You requisition collection vials, signal flares, diving knives
*	Healing potions are distributed (you still have one Greater Healing, now 
supplemented with regular healing potions)
*	Weighted belts and specialized gear for everyone
As the sun sets, you return to the temple quarters for one final night's rest 
before tomorrow's mission.
Dawn departure. Ready to end the session here, or continue to the 
ship?
End session. Let's get a summary explicit to this thread i can export

*	Reported back to plan coordinated assault
Strategic Decision:
*	Organized town evacuation to inland settlement (Saltmere)
*	Set traps throughout village to catch returning raiders
*	Party infiltrated cave while sahuagin raiding party attacked empty town
Underwater Battle (Main Nest):
*	Used Water Breathing (Cyrus) and Cloak of the Manta Ray (Johannes)

Current Mission: Travel to Ak-Thyln naval garrison with intelligence
ACT 4: AK-THYLN AND THE ABOLETH
Journey: Three days hard riding to reach major port city
Temple Research (Kiri-Jolith):
*	Identified threat: Kh'leth the Drowned, an ancient aboleth
*	Aboleths: 20-foot eel-like aberrations, masters of mental domination
*	Pre-Cataclysm entity, supposedly bound by gods centuries ago
*	Powers: telepathy, enslavement via mucus, psychic attacks, lair control
*	Mucus danger: transforms breathing (water YES, air NO) - fatal 
without Lesser Restoration
Timeline Discovered:
*	Planetary conjunction in 3 weeks that hasn't occurred in 1000+ years
*	Matches timeframe of Kh'leth's original binding
*	Conjunction will weaken divine bindings - THIS IS THE DEADLINE
Key Intelligence:
*	Mucus reversal tactic discovered in ancient texts (can be used against 
aboleth)
*	Aboleths hate gods, never forget, think in centuries
*	Previous encounters with aboleth lairs: heroes don't return, return 
enslaved, or return traumatized
Military Coordination:
*	Met Admiral Kethren (skeptical but competent naval commander)
*	Met Captain-Cleric Thessa (Kiri-Jolith, maritime specialist)
*	Convinced them of threat with physical evidence
*	Approved three-phase plan: Reconnaissance ? Preparation ? 
Assault/Containment
Reconnaissance Mission (departing dawn):
*	Ship: Stormbreaker (fast sloop, 30 crew)

*	Party follows at distance with Thessa's group
*	Check-in every 10 minutes via Maren's Message cantrip
*	If Johannes misses check-in: assume compromise, abort mission

*	Emergency ascent: accept injury risk, heal on surface
*	Johannes can Dimension Door to surface (500 ft range)
Mucus Reversal Tactic (desperation move):
*	Collect aboleth mucus in sealed vials (using Mage Hand)
*	Coat weapons or attempt to redirect tentacle against aboleth itself
*	Forces aboleth to transform to air-breathing = drowns underwater
*	EXTREMELY RISKY, last resort only

## MAJOR EVENTS

### ACT 1: THE FISHING VILLAGE ATTACKS

#### Discovery
Arrived at unnamed fishing village experiencing mysterious incidents:
- Villagers disappearing at night (sleepwalking toward water)
- Missing fishing boat (*Silver Catch*, 3 crew members)
- Another boat (*Wavecrest*) returned with crew traumatized, reporting 
"things in the water"
- No boats going out for a week, town paralyzed by fear
- Population approximately 100 people

#### Investigation
**Key NPCs Met:**
- Aldric (innkeeper at Whalebone Inn)
- Tam (old fisherman, 60s)
- Marten (local fisherman, cousin connections)
- Wilhelm (elderly man, demolitions knowledge)

**Pattern Discovered:**
- Victims had found "cursed items" washed ashore
- Items included: shells (iridescent), coins (strange markings), masks 
(carved from bone/shell)
- Items created enchantment effects, compelling wearers toward the sea
- Four known sleepwalkers: Petra Fischer (16), Mara (weaver), Jens (cooper's 
son), Willem

**Petra Fischer - First Victim Freed:**
- Found beautiful pendant on beach
- Wore it for days, became entranced
- Father (Ren Fischer) forcibly removed pendant, she collapsed
- Brother Cyrus cast *Lesser Restoration*, breaking enchantment
- She provided intelligence: "singing" in her head, compulsion to bring 
"gifts" to the water
- Confirmed others had similar experiences

#### Beach Confrontation (First Major Combat)

**Enemy Forces:**
- 12 sahuagin warriors (scaled fish-men, coral spears, bone weapons)
- 1 sahuagin priestess (larger, wore shell armor, carried glowing trident)
- Conducting ritual singing to summon enthralled villagers

**Battle Outcome:**
- Johannes focused fire on priestess with Hex + Eldritch Blast
- Killed priestess (critical to breaking enchantment)
- Defeated 6 warriors on beach
- Saved Mara, Jens, and Gareth from being dragged into water
- **Casualties**: None (party or civilians)
- **Damage Taken**: Johannes 32 damage, Kessa 10 damage

**Immediate Actions:**
- Organized town evacuation to inland settlement (Saltmere)
- Set traps throughout village (oil, tripwires, caltrops, collapsing 
shelving)
- Rigged lanterns on pulleys to simulate occupancy
- Positioned Marten, Tam, and Wilhelm on ridge with signal fire

### ACT 2: THE CAVE ASSAULT

#### Reconnaissance Mission
**Johannes Solo Scout:**
- Located cave entrance 2 miles north of village
- Used *One with Shadows* (invisibility in darkness) for infiltration
- Discovered entry chamber with 6 sahuagin (4 sleeping, 2 conducting prayers)
- Mapped two passages: one level/navigable, one fully submerged
- Found evidence of "something larger" (massive footprints)
- Exfiltrated undetected
- **Intelligence Value**: High - confirmed nest location, assessed defenses

#### Strategic Planning
**Decision**: Simultaneous operations
- Town traps would catch returning raiders
- Party would assault nest while sahuagin were away
- Signal fire would coordinate timing

#### Nest Investigation

**Critical Intelligence Discovered:**

*Strategic Documents:*
- **Maps**: THREE coastal villages marked for attack
  1. Original village (Saltmere area)
  2. Beacon's Rest (8 miles south)
  3. Driftwood Cove (8 miles further south)
- **Offshore Symbol**: Large marking 5-6 miles out to sea
  - Depth notations: ~200 feet
  - Lines connecting to all three villages
  - Crude drawings of underwater structures
  - This was the COMMAND CENTER, not just a raid staging area

*Ritual Materials:*
- Priestess's notes in Sahuagin script
- References to "the Deep One" 
- Phrase: "when the stars align"
- Instructions for "gathering thralls"
- Workshop area with MASS PRODUCTION of cursed items
- Multiple shells, coins, masks in various stages of completion

*Altar and Religious Items:*
- Crude altar to Sekolah (Shark God)
- Hidden symbols of something deeper, older, more sinister
- Black coral amulet (twisted symbol, painful to look at)
- Offerings: humanoid bones, pearls, salvaged ship goods

*Evidence of Missing Crew:*
- Torn clothing from *Silver Catch* crew members
- Three sets of manacles (recently used)
- Personal effects: carved pipe, silver locket, fishing knife
- **Pile of gnawed humanoid bones** (confirmed: crew was eaten)
- No survivors, no prisoners kept

**Tactical Assessment:**
- This wasn't random raiding - highly organized recruitment operation
- Cursed items were tools for building thrall army
- Multiple villages targeted simultaneously
- Something called "the Deep One" commanding operations
- Sahuagin serving as foot soldiers/raiders for greater power

#### Nest Destruction
**Systematic Demolition:**
- Smashed altars and ritual components
- Destroyed workshop where cursed items were made
- Used oil and fire in accessible dry sections
- Collapsed structural points with Rope of Entanglement
- Made location uninhabitable for sahuagin return
- Smoke filled upper chambers - nest completely ruined

**Items Secured:**
- Chieftain's electric trident (magical weapon)
- Priestess's notes and maps
- Sample cursed items (sealed for study)
- Personal effects from *Silver Catch* crew (for families)
- Black coral amulet (sealed, dangerous)

### ACT 3: THE THREE VILLAGES

#### Warning and Evacuation Campaign

**Village 1: Saltmere (Original)**
- Already evacuated during cave assault
- Traps successfully repelled sahuagin return raid
- Raiders found empty town, triggered oil fires and bells
- Retreated after ~20 minutes of confusion
- No casualties, no property damage beyond trap activation
- Aldric (innkeeper) witnessed from cellar - confirmed success

**Village 2: Beacon's Rest (8 miles south)**
- Party rode directly there after cave assault
- Arrived before dawn after grueling night journey
- Population ~150 (larger than first village)
- Presented evidence to town council
- Council members skeptical until seeing maps and physical proof
- Harbormaster recognized their village marked on sahuagin maps
- **Decision**: Immediate evacuation to Saltmere
- Organized departure within 2 hours
- Aldric volunteered to lead warning party to third village

**Village 3: Driftwood Cove (8 miles further south)**
- Aldric led 10 mounted riders
- Departed Beacon's Rest heading south
- 8 miles distance = ~90 minutes ride
- Delivered warning with maps and evidence
- Village believed them (established community connections)
- Began evacuation immediately
- Aldric's party returned through Beacon's Rest
- **All three villages successfully warned and evacuating**

**Results:**
- ~400 people total across three villages saved
- Zero casualties from sahuagin raids
- All communities relocated inland to Saltmere
- Sahuagin raiding network disrupted
- Forward operating base (cave) destroyed

#### Decision: Ak-Thyln

**Strategic Reasoning:**
- Offshore threat remained (the "Deep One")
- Party lacked resources for deep-water assault
- Needed naval and magical support
- Ak-Thyln: major port city, 3 days northeast
- Known for: naval garrison, maritime temples, experienced with sea threats

**Journey:**
- Three days hard riding (borrowed horses from Aldric's party)
- Carried: all evidence, maps, notes, trident, sealed cursed items
- Harbormaster of Beacon's Rest provided letter of introduction to Admiral 
Kethren
- Used *Sending Stone* to inform Laurana at Haven of plan

**Laurana's Response** (via Sending):
- Approved tactical decision
- Will coordinate with Ak-Thyln through official channels
- WARNING: "Watch for Dragon Army presence - contested territory"
- "Stay safe" - rare personal concern from commander

### ACT 4: AK-THYLN AND THE ABOLETH REVELATION

#### Arrival at Ak-Thyln

**The City:**
- Major port with stone walls and watchtowers
- Massive harbor: dozens of ships, naval facilities
- Warships at anchor, active patrol boats
- Maritime temples prominent near waterfront
- Professional military presence
- Population: several thousand (proper city, not village)

**Strategic Approach:**
- Went to Temple of Kiri-Jolith FIRST (not military)
- Reasoning: get theological/magical expertise before military briefing
- Cyrus as fellow cleric provided credibility
- Temple could verify threat, provide context

#### Temple of Kiri-Jolith Research

**Captain-Cleric Thessa:**
- Senior temple official, ~50s
- Combined religious authority with naval experience
- Wears ceremonial robes with naval insignia
- Command presence, takes threats seriously
- Immediately brought party to war room when hearing "sahuagin" and "Deep 
One"

**Initial Translation of Sahuagin Notes:**
Thessa can read Sahuagin script (naval clerics study enemy languages):

*Key Passages Translated:*
- "The Deep One stirs in its temple..."
- "The stars move toward alignment..."
- "Surface dwellers will serve or feed..."
- "The faithful gather strength..."
- "Three settlements marked for harvest..."
- "Thralls prepared for the awakening..."
- "**When Kh'leth rises, the coastlands will know their master...**"

**Critical Discovery: KHLETH**
- Not just "Deep One" - a SPECIFIC NAME
- Not generic sahuagin deity
- Pre-Cataclysm entity from ancient records

**Brother Aldwyn - Temple Scholar:**
Led extensive research in temple library over several hours:

**KHLETH THE DROWNED - Historical Records:**

*Ancient Identity:*
- One of the "Deep Ancients" - primordial aboleths
- Ruled vast underwater domains before Age of Dreams
- Commanded "legions of the scaled ones" (sahuagin)
- Built "temples in the lightless depths"
- Ruled when world was young, before gods

*The Binding:*
- Bound by combined power of THREE sea deities during Second Dragon War
- Location: "The Kraken's Shelf" (deep ocean trench)
- Required divine intervention + major sacrifice (text damaged, details lost)
- Binding specifically tied to stellar positions
- Meant to last "until stars return to ancient positions"

*Why It Awakens Now:*
- Divine bindings weaken during specific celestial events
- Rare planetary conjunction approaching
- **TIMELINE DISCOVERED**: Conjunction in **3 WEEKS**
- Configuration hasn't occurred in over 1,000 years
- Matches timeframe of original binding

**ABOLETH - Species Information:**

*Physical Description:*
- 20 feet long, eel-like body
- Four powerful tentacles
- Covered in mucus (weaponized)
- Can survive in water OR air (prefer water)
- Ancient beyond mortal comprehension

*Mental Powers:*
- Telepathy: 120 feet range
- Enslavement through mucus contact (PERMANENT mental domination)
- Psychic assault attacks (damage minds directly)
- Perfect memory stretching back MILLENNIA
- Natural spellcasting (illusion and enchantment focus)
- Can probe minds of creatures in lair

*The Mucus (CRITICAL THREAT):*
- Secreted from aboleth skin
- One touch = transformation curse
- Effect if save failed:
  - **Can breathe WATER**
  - **CANNOT breathe AIR**
  - Lasts hours without treatment
  - Requires *Lesser Restoration* to cure
  - Makes surface escape impossible
  - Essentially: instant drowning on land/ship

*Thrall Creation:*
- Enslaved creatures become PERMANENT servants
- Retain all abilities but serve aboleth absolutely
- Only freed by *Greater Restoration* OR aboleth's death
- Aboleth collect thralls obsessively (building armies)

*Lair Powers:*
- Control water currents
- Create phantasmal images
- Probe minds of all creatures nearby
- Environmental advantages overwhelming

*Psychology:*
- View themselves as rightful rulers of world
- Remember when they dominated primordial oceans
- Existed BEFORE gods or dragons
- Plans span CENTURIES (think long-term)
- Hate gods (view them as usurpers)
- Never forget slights - revenge across millennia
- Supremely arrogant due to age and power

**Aboleth Weaknesses Discovered:**

*From Ancient Texts:*

1. **Psychic Protection Works:**
   - *Mind Blank* (high level)
   - *Protection from Evil and Good* (available)
   - Items like Ring of Mind Shielding
   - Mental barriers prevent domination

2. **Physical Mortality:**
   - Can be killed through sufficient damage
   - Not immortal, just ancient
   - Standard weapons work if you can hit them

3. **Environmental Weakness:**
   - Require water or moisture
   - Dry environments weaken them significantly
   - Prolonged exposure to dry air is harmful

4. **Tactical Overconfidence:**
   - Arrogance from millennia of existence
   - Can be outmaneuvered by clever tactics
   - Underestimate "lesser beings"

5. **MUCUS REVERSAL** (CRITICAL DISCOVERY):
   - Aboleths NOT immune to own mucus
   - Historical account: warrior forced tentacle against aboleth's body
   - Transformation took effect ON THE ABOLETH
   - Air-breathing aboleth DROWNED underwater
   - "The creature's own slime proved its undoing"
   
   *Alternative Method:*
   - Sea elf tribe collected mucus in vials after battle
   - Coated weapons with stored mucus
   - Used against aboleth in later encounter
   - Each mucus-coated strike risked triggering transformation

**Warnings from Historical Accounts:**

*Outcomes of Previous Lair Expeditions:*
- Heroes don't return (killed/trapped)
- Heroes return enslaved (now thralls)
- Heroes return "changed" - traumatized by visions
- Aboleths show victims their true reality (millions of years of memory)
- Mental trauma even without domination

*Strategic Notes:*
- Never underestimate aboleth patience (they think in centuries)
- Never underestimate aboleth intelligence (ancient beyond comprehension)
- Whatever you see in lair = planned for longer than your civilization exists
- Damaging lair/treasures enrages them (causes tactical mistakes)
- Some cultures defeated aboleths by exploiting arrogance

#### Military Briefing - Admiral Kethren

**Admiral Kethren:**
- Naval commander, ~60s
- Weathered by decades at sea
- Sharp eyes, misses nothing
- Skeptical by nature but pragmatic
- Professional military bearing
- Listens to facts, prepares for threats

**The Presentation:**
- Cyrus led (cleric to military commander)
- Laid out evidence systematically:
  - Maps showing three villages + offshore location
  - Ritual notes with translations
  - Physical proof: trident, cursed items
  - Confirmed kills: 15+ sahuagin including chieftain and priestess
  - Three villages evacuated successfully
  
**Thessa's Professional Assessment:**
"The threat is real, Admiral. Whether it's truly an ancient aboleth awakening 
or something else, these sahuagin are organized, equipped with magic, and 
targeting coastal populations systematically. Left unchecked, this spreads."

**Kethren's Response:**
- Confirmed: increased sahuagin sightings for months
- Missing fishing boats, strange sounds in deep water
- Captains thought it was seasonal migration
- Evidence suggests coordinated campaign instead
- **DECISION**: Approved reconnaissance mission

**Three-Phase Operational Plan:**

*Phase One: RECONNAISSANCE (Current Mission)*
- Verify location and assess threat
- Naval vessel with diving capabilities
- Magical support: clerics with *Water Breathing*, diviners
- Sail to coordinates, survey, map if possible
- NO ENGAGEMENT unless survival requires it
- Timeline: 3-5 days for recon
- Goal: Determine what's down there

*Phase Two: CONSULTATION AND PREPARATION*
- Once threat confirmed, coordinate resources
- Request specialized support:
  - Paladins trained against aberrations
  - Mages with anti-psychic expertise
  - Equipment protecting against mental domination
- This isn't normal naval engagement
- Prepare for unique threat

*Phase Three: ASSAULT OR CONTAINMENT*
- If can be eliminated: coordinated strike
- If too powerful (Kh'leth as powerful as legends):
  - Implement containment measures
  - Magical wards, divine barriers
  - Permanent naval patrols
  - Prevent spread until sufficient force gathered

**Resources Committed:**

*Ship:* **The Stormbreaker**
- Fast sloop (nimble, not heavy warship)
- 30 crew members
- Experienced in deep-water operations
- Reinforced diving capabilities
- Captain: Meredith Andra (best for unconventional ops)

*Temple Support:*
- Captain-Cleric Thessa (personally leading)
- Acolyte Maren (divination/water magic specialist)
- Acolyte Donal (healing/protection specialist)

*Party Status:*
- Listed as "civilian specialists attached to temple personnel"
- Official status without naval chain of command
- Report to Thessa regarding mission objectives
- Captain Andra has final authority on ship
- **Payment**: None requested - party volunteering

**Mission Parameters:**
- Survey reconnaissance zone (5-6 miles offshore, 200 feet deep)
- Assess threat level
- Determine if binding still holds
- Map lair if possible without engagement
- NO HEROICS - survival and intelligence are priorities
- Report back with actionable intelligence

**Political Dimension - Haven Alliance:**
Johannes raised potential cooperation between Ak-Thyln and Haven resistance:
- Kethren aware of Pax Tharkas liberation (700 prisoners freed)
- Impressed by resistance competence
- Ak-Thyln cautious (trade city, can't afford open Dragon Army conflict)
- **Interested in covert cooperation**:
  - Intelligence sharing on Dragon Army naval movements
  - Coordinated strikes on coastal targets
  - Mutual support against shared threats
- **Agreement**: Survive aboleth mission first, then facilitate Kethren-
Laurana meeting

#### Preparation Day

**Equipment from Naval Quartermaster:**

*Underwater Combat Gear:*
- Weighted belts (depth control)
- Diving knives (cutting through kelp/nets/tentacles)
- Waterproof signal flares (emergency communication)
- Rope and grappling gear (underwater terrain navigation)
- Sealed containers (specimen collection)
- Healing potions (distributed among team)
- Shielded alchemical lights (concealed when needed)

*Weapon Adaptations:*
- **Javelins** for Kessa (crossbow useless underwater)
- **Harpoons** available (weighted for underwater throwing)
- **Nets** (weighted, for entangling)
- **Tridents/spears** (piercing works best)
- **Maces** (bludgeoning effective due to water resistance)

*Armor Changes:*
- Cyrus: Switched to studded leather (chain mail too heavy)
- Donal: Wearing padded cloth (mobility over protection)
- Philosophy: Can't fight if you drown

**Magical Preparations Planned:**

*Communication:*
- Maren has *Message* cantrip (120 feet range, whispered)
- Plan: Johannes scouts ahead invisible
- Check-in every 10 minutes (return to visual range)
- Miss check-in = assume compromise, begin withdrawal

*Protection Spells:*
- *Protection from Evil and Good* on Kessa + one other
  - Advantage on saves vs aberrations
  - Prevents charm/fear effects
- *Bless* on entire party (improve saving throws)
- *Aid* if available (boost HP and resilience)
- *Calm Emotions* ready (suppress active charm effects)

*Environmental:*
- *Water Breathing* on entire party (Cyrus casting)
- Duration: 10 hours (more than enough)

*Healing Ready:*
- Multiple *Cure Wounds* prepared
- *Lesser Restoration* (counter mucus transformation)
- Emergency healing on surface if needed

**Vision Capabilities:**
- Johannes: Devil's Sight (see in magical darkness 120 ft)
- Cyrus: Goggles of Night (see in darkness as daylight, 60 ft)
- Kessa: Natural darkvision 60 ft (half-elf)
- Maren/Donal/Thessa: Need light OR magical darkvision
- **Decision**: Shielded lights only, minimize detection risk

**Mucus Collection Protocol:**
- Sealed vials provided
- Maren will use *Mage Hand* to collect samples remotely
- Coating weapons possible (desperation tactic)
- ONE MISTAKE = transformation curse
- Reserved as LAST RESORT option

**Tactical Approach Finalized:**

*Stealth-Focused Reconnaissance:*

1. **Johannes as Primary Scout:**
   - *One with Shadows* (invisible in darkness/dim light)
   - Cloak of the Manta Ray (swimming speed + water breathing)
   - Ring of Mind Shielding (IMMUNE to mental domination)
   - Trident of Warning (prevents surprise, +1 weapon)
   - Scout ahead, stay in shadows, maximum stealth
   
2. **Support Element:**
   - Cyrus, Kessa, Thessa, two acolytes
   - Follow at distance (50-100 feet behind)
   - Ready to provide support or retreat
   - Kessa on rocky ledges (uses harpoon/javelins from high ground)
   - Cyrus and clerics in water (healing/support/protection)

3. **Communication Protocol:**
   - Check-in every 10 minutes via *Message*
   - Colored flares for distance signaling
   - Hand signals for close range
   - Strict time limits (mission abort if Johannes missing)

4. **Emergency Extraction:**
   - If mucus contact: surface IMMEDIATELY, get *Lesser Restoration*
   - If mental domination: *Calm Emotions*, retreat to regroup
   - If aboleth appears: DO NOT ENGAGE, retreat immediately
   - Emergency ascent: accept injury risk, heal on surface
   - Johannes: *Dimension Door* (500 ft teleport to surface)

5. **Rules of Engagement:**
   - Reconnaissance ONLY
   - Observe, map, assess
   - No heroics, no combat unless survival requires
   - Intelligence and survival are mission success
   - If captured/enslaved: extract survivors, return with overwhelming force

**Timeline Pressure:**
- 3 weeks until planetary conjunction
- Binding weakens when "stars align"
- Kh'leth at maximum strength during conjunction
- Reconnaissance determines: Do we have 3 weeks or 3 days?
- Urgency: This isn't just scouting, this is threat assessment

- Presented intelligence to military commanders professionally
- Deferred to Cyrus when appropriate (temple/military briefing)
- Recognized party strengths (Cyrus leads religious/military, Johannes 
tactical)

**Strategic Thinking:**
- Identified need for naval support (didn't try to solo aboleth)
- Three-day journey to get proper resources (patience vs impulsiveness)
- Established Ak-Thyln/Haven potential alliance (long-term thinking)
- Prepared multiple contingencies (mucus reversal, escape routes)

### Kessa "Keys" Darrow - Level 7 (Rogue 5/Bard 2)

- **Sneak Attack**: 3d6
- **Bardic Inspiration**: 4 uses (d6)

#### Equipment Adaptation for Underwater

## CURRENT TACTICAL SITUATION

### Mission Overview

**OPERATION**: Reconnaissance of suspected aboleth lair  
**OBJECTIVE**: Survey, assess threat level, map if possible, report 
intelligence  
**RULES OF ENGAGEMENT**: Stealth-first, avoid combat, retreat if detected  
**TIMELINE**: Depart dawn (next session), 4-5 hour sail to coordinates

### Ship Assignment: *Stormbreaker*

**Vessel Type**: Fast sloop (nimble, not heavy warship)
- 30 experienced crew members
- Designed for deep-water operations
- Reinforced diving capabilities
- Equipped with naval charts, safety equipment

**Captain Meredith Andra**:
- Admiral Kethren's best for unconventional operations
- Experience working with temple mages
- Final authority on ship operations
- Coordinates with Thessa for mission objectives

### Mission Personnel

**Civilian Specialists (Party):**
- Johannes Constantinius (primary scout, mental protection)
- Kessa Darrow (support fire, elevated positions)
- Brother Cyrus (healing, protection, water breathing)

**Temple Support (Kiri-Jolith):**
- Captain-Cleric Thessa (mission commander for objectives)
- Acolyte Maren (divination/water magic, *Message* cantrip)
- Acolyte Donal (healing/protection specialist)

**Naval Crew:**
- Captain Andra (ship command)
- 30 crew (sailing, safety, surface support)
- Marines (if combat on surface required)

### Target Location

**Coordinates**: 5-6 miles offshore from coastal villages  
**Depth**: Approximately 200 feet  
**Terrain**: Unknown (suspected underwater structures)  
**Threats**: 
- Kh'leth (ancient aboleth) - likely present
- Sahuagin warriors (survivors from destroyed nest)
- Unknown additional forces
- Environmental hazards (pressure, darkness, currents)

**Why This Location**:
- Maps from priestess show this as command center
- Lines connecting to all three targeted villages
- Depth notations and structural drawings
- Sahuagin nest was just forward operating base

### Tactical Approach: Stealth Reconnaissance

#### Phase 1: Descent (Preparation)

**Pre-Dive Buffs** (Cast on ship before descent):
- *Water Breathing* (Cyrus) - entire party, 24 hours duration
  - Cast as ritual (no spell slot cost)
  - Everyone can breathe underwater freely
- *Aid* (Cyrus) - three party members, +5 HP, 8 hours duration
  - No concentration required
  - Improves survivability
- *Protection from Evil and Good* (Thessa) - on Kessa
  - Prevents aboleth charm/fear
  - Advantage on saves vs aberrations
  - Concentration required (Thessa maintains)
- Equipment check: Weighted belts, diving knives, lights secured

**Descent Method**:
- Rope line from *Stormbreaker* to sea floor
- Slow, controlled descent (avoid pressure problems)
- Check-in signals during descent
- Party stays together initially

#### Phase 2: Initial Survey (Stealth)

**Formation**:
     JOHANNES (solo, invisible scout)
            ? 50-100 feet ahead
            ?
     [Main Group] - follows at distance
     - Cyrus (center, ready to heal/protect)
     - Kessa (rocky ledges, elevated fire support)
     - Thessa (maintains Protection on Kessa)
     - Maren (communication via Message)
     - Donal (backup healing)

**Johannes Scout Capabilities**:
- *One with Shadows*: Invisible in darkness/dim light (no action)
- *Devil's Sight*: See clearly in magical darkness (120 ft)
- Cloak of Manta Ray: Swim speed 30 ft (matches walking)
- Ring of Mind Shielding: **IMMUNE to aboleth mental domination**
- Trident of Warning: Can't be surprised, advantage on initiative

**Scout Protocol**:
1. Johannes moves ahead invisibly
2. Observes from shadows (stays hidden)
3. Maps layout mentally
4. Returns every 10 minutes to visual range of Maren
5. Maren uses *Message* for silent communication
6. Johannes reports findings
7. Party adjusts plan based on intelligence
8. Repeat

**If Johannes Misses Check-In**:
- Wait 5 additional minutes
- Assume compromise
- Begin immediate withdrawal to surface
- Do NOT attempt rescue (prevents cascade failure)

#### Phase 3: Deep Reconnaissance (If Safe)

**Objective**: Map lair, count forces, assess Kh'leth's status

**What to Look For**:
- Kh'leth itself (size, condition, activity level)
- Number of sahuagin present
- Other creatures/thralls
- Lair structure (chambers, passages, defensive positions)
- Evidence of binding (magical wards, divine symbols, weakening)
- Preparations for "awakening" (rituals, gathered forces, timing indicators)

**Information Priority**:
1. **CRITICAL**: Is Kh'leth already free or still bound?
2. **HIGH**: How strong is Kh'leth? (weakened vs full power)
3. **HIGH**: How many forces? (dozens vs hundreds)
4. **MEDIUM**: Lair defenses and layout
5. **LOW**: Treasure, additional intelligence

**Stealth Maintenance**:
- Johannes: Stay in shadows, use invisibility
- Main group: Minimize light, move slowly
- Communication: *Message* only (silent)
- No combat unless absolutely necessary for survival

#### Phase 4: Emergency Protocols

**IF DETECTED BY ABOLETH:**

**Immediate Actions**:
1. Johannes: *Dimension Door* to surface (500 ft teleport)
   - OR *Misty Step* (30 ft) to break line of sight, re-engage *One with 
Shadows*
2. Main Group: Begin fighting retreat
3. Thessa: Maintain *Protection* on Kessa, prepare *Calm Emotions*
4. Cyrus: *Bless* on party (improve saves)
5. Everyone: Move toward rope/surface

**DO NOT**:
- Attempt to fight aboleth directly
- Rescue fallen/dominated party members in moment
- Stay to gather more intelligence
- Pursue enemy forces

**Aboleth Attacks to Watch For**:
- **Tentacle Strike + Mucus**: 
  - Contact = transformation (breathe water, NOT air)
  - Victim must surface IMMEDIATELY
  - Cyrus casts *Lesser Restoration* within minutes
  - Without cure: victim drowns on ship deck
- **Enslave (Mental Domination)**:
  - Target makes WIS save vs aboleth DC (likely 14-17)
  - Johannes: Immune (Ring of Mind Shielding)
  - Kessa: Advantage (Protection from Evil) + Fey Ancestry advantage
  - Others: Standard save
  - If enslaved: Cyrus casts *Calm Emotions* (suppresses, doesn't remove)
- **Psychic Blast**:
  - Psychic damage to multiple targets
  - Can't be avoided like physical attacks
  - Healing needed quickly
- **Lair Actions** (if in lair proper):
  - Water currents (forced movement)
  - Phantasmal images (confusion, fear)
  - Mental probing (learn plans/weaknesses)

**IF MUCUS CONTACT OCCURS**:
1. Victim: Surface IMMEDIATELY (before transformation completes)
2. Cyrus: Move toward victim, ready *Lesser Restoration*
3. Party: Cover victim's ascent
4. Surface crew: Pull victim aboard
5. Cyrus: Cast *Lesser Restoration* within 1-2 minutes
6. Without cure: Victim suffocates on deck (can't breathe air)

**IF SOMEONE ENSLAVED**:
1. Cyrus: *Calm Emotions* (20-foot radius, suppresses charm)
2. Party: Continue retreat
3. Victim: Might resist control temporarily
4. Return later with *Greater Restoration* or kill aboleth (breaks 
enchantment)
5. **DO NOT** sacrifice multiple party members trying to save one

**Emergency Ascent**:
- Swim up as fast as possible
- Johannes: *Dimension Door* (instant surface)
- Others: Standard swim speed
- Accept injury risk from rapid ascent (pressure sickness)
- Healing on surface (better hurt than enslaved/dead)

#### Phase 5: Mucus Reversal (DESPERATION TACTIC ONLY)

**Trigger**: Party cornered, no escape, aboleth engaged

**Method 1 - Weapon Coating**:
1. Maren: Use *Mage Hand* to collect mucus (30 ft range, no contact)
2. Seal in vial (already prepared)
3. Coat weapon (Johannes's trident or other)
4. Strike aboleth with coated weapon
5. Aboleth makes save vs own mucus
6. If fails: Transforms to air-breather, begins drowning underwater

**Method 2 - Forced Contact**:
1. Johannes: Engage in melee (protected from mental domination)
2. When aboleth attacks with tentacle (mucus contact threat)
3. Johannes: Attempt to redirect tentacle against aboleth itself
4. Requires successful combat maneuver (contested check)
5. If successful: Aboleth's own tentacle touches its body
6. Mucus transformation affects aboleth
7. Aboleth drowns underwater (can breathe air, NOT water)

**Extreme Risk**:
- Requires melee range with aboleth (20-foot creature)
- Johannes within reach of multiple tentacles
- One failed save = enslaved party member
- One mucus contact on Johannes = transformation (needs *Lesser Restoration*)
- High chance of casualties
- **ONLY if alternative is total party kill**

### Communication Plan

**Method 1 - Message Cantrip** (Primary, close range):
- Maren casts *Message* to Johannes (120 ft range)
- Whispered magical communication
- Johannes responds same way
- Check-in every 10 minutes
- Range limit: Main group must follow within 120 feet

**Method 2 - Hand Signals** (Backup, visual range):
- Standard naval diving signals
- Requires line of sight
- Useful when within 30-60 feet
- Pre-arranged meanings:
  - Danger ahead
  - Retreat now
  - Enemy sighted
  - Regroup

**Method 3 - Colored Flares** (Emergency, long range):
- Waterproof signal flares
- Different colors = different meanings
  - Red: Emergency, abort mission
  - Green: All clear, continue
  - Blue: Need assistance
  - Yellow: Regroup at rally point
- Visible at distance but HIGHLY visible to enemies
- Last resort only

**Communication Rules**:
- Silence = primary goal
- *Message* only when necessary
- No verbal communication unless combat already detected
- Flares = last resort (compromises stealth completely)

### Timeline and Urgency

**Planetary Conjunction**: 3 weeks from current date  
**What This Means**:
- Five celestial bodies align (rare configuration)
- Last occurred 1,000+ years ago (matches Kh'leth's binding timeframe)
- Divine bindings weaken during conjunction
- Kh'leth will be at maximum strength
- If freed during conjunction: catastrophic

**Mission Determines**:
1. **Best Case**: Kh'leth still fully bound, binding holding strong
   - Timeline: 3 weeks to prepare proper assault
   - Can coordinate with multiple cities
   - Gather specialized resources (anti-aberration paladins, etc.)
   - Plan comprehensive operation

2. **Medium Case**: Kh'leth partially bound, weakening but not free
   - Timeline: 1-2 weeks to act
   - Immediate coordination with Ak-Thyln forces
   - Strike before conjunction completes
   - Less preparation time but possible

3. **Worst Case**: Kh'leth already free or nearly so
   - Timeline: Days, maybe hours
   - Immediate military response
   - Emergency assault with available forces
   - Accept higher casualties to prevent coastal catastrophe

**Reconnaissance Determines Response**:
- Not just scouting
- This intelligence sets entire strategy
- Determines if naval/temple resources sufficient
- May require calling in additional help (Haven resistance, other cities, 
etc.)

### Success Criteria

**PRIMARY OBJECTIVE**:
- Confirm Kh'leth's location ? or ?
- Assess binding status (free, weakening, or intact)
- Return with intelligence

**SECONDARY OBJECTIVES**:
- Map lair layout
- Count enemy forces (sahuagin, thralls, others)
- Identify defensive measures
- Assess Kh'leth's condition (weakened, full power, etc.)

**FAILURE CONDITIONS**:
- Party member killed
- Party member permanently enslaved (without *Greater Restoration* access)
- Entire party detected without gathering useful intelligence
- Mission abort without learning anything

**ACCEPTABLE OUTCOMES**:
- Retreat if detected (intelligence > casualties)
- Incomplete mapping if necessary
- Party injuries if intelligence gathered
- **Survival + basic intel = success**

### Risk Assessment

**HIGH RISK FACTORS**:
- Ancient, intelligent enemy (plans in centuries)
- Mental domination (permanent enslavement)
- Mucus transformation (drowning on land)
- 200-foot depth (pressure, distance from safety)
- Unknown lair layout
- Potential for overwhelming force

**MITIGATIONS**:
- Johannes immune to mental domination (Ring)
- *Protection from Evil and Good* on Kessa (advantage vs domination)
- *Lesser Restoration* prepared (counter mucus)
- Multiple escape options (*Dimension Door*, rapid ascent)
- Communication protocol (regular check-ins)
- Strict ROE (retreat if detected, no heroics)

**ACCEPTABLE LOSSES**:
- Injury requiring healing (acceptable, can heal)
- Spell slot expenditure (acceptable, needed for survival)
- Equipment left behind (acceptable, lives > gear)
- Incomplete intelligence (acceptable if survival threatened)

**UNACCEPTABLE LOSSES**:
- Party member death (preventable with proper tactics)
- Party member enslavement (requires *Greater Restoration* to fix)
- Entire party compromise (no intelligence gained)
- Unnecessary risks (heroics vs intelligence gathering)

### Post-Reconnaissance Plan

**IMMEDIATE** (Upon Return to *Stormbreaker*):
1. Surface crew: Medical check, warm blankets, food
2. Cyrus: Heal injuries, treat any
Continue
Dec 9
conditions 3. Party: Quick debrief with Captain Andra (ship safety) 4. Thessa: 
Initial assessment (what we found) 5. Decision: Return to port or continue 
observation?
RETURN TO AK-THYLN (Within 6-8 hours):
1.	Full debriefing with Admiral Kethren
2.	Thessa provides theological/magical assessment
3.	Johannes presents tactical intelligence
4.	Map lair (if mapped successfully)
5.	Count forces, assess binding status
6.	CRITICAL: Determine timeline (3 weeks, days, or hours?)
STRATEGIC DECISION (Admiral Kethren + Thessa + Party):
Option A - 3 Week Timeline (Binding Holds Strong):

Contingency Plans
IF JOHANNES CAPTURED/KILLED:

*	Consider abort vs adapt
*	Kessa becomes primary scout (less effective)
IF KESSA CAPTURED/ENSLAVED:

*	Could become enemy intelligence source (knows party tactics)
IF CYRUS CAPTURED/ENSLAVED:
*	Lose primary healer
*	Lose Water Breathing (mission ends)
*	Lose Lesser Restoration (mucus transformation = death sentence)
*	Mission critical capability lost
IF THESSA/ACOLYTES LOST:

*	Retreat to Stormbreaker
*	Return to Ak-Thyln for reinforcements
*	Report failure but preserve remaining party
IF KHLETH DIRECTLY ENGAGES:
*	Immediate retreat (no discussion)
*	Use all escape abilities (Dimension Door, etc.)
*	Accept casualties to save survivors
*	Goal: Someone reaches surface with intelligence
*	Reform at ship, decide next move
IF OVERWHELMED BY SAHUAGIN:
*	Fighting retreat (phased withdrawal)
*	Spiritual Weapon + ranged attacks cover retreat
*	Johannes uses Repelling Blast (push enemies back)
*	Use terrain (narrow passages, chokepoints)
*	Surface if necessary, even if mission incomplete
IF MUCUS TRANSFORMATION OCCURS (No Lesser 
Restoration Available):
*	Victim has minutes to hours
*	Emergency ascent
*	Reach surface crew
*	Send for temple clerics (Ak-Thyln)
*	Victim must stay in water until cured
*	Keep submerged in barrel/tank on ship
*	Race back to port for Lesser Restoration
IF COMMUNICATION LOST:
*	Johannes: Return to last known main group position
*	Main Group: Wait at rally point (rope line)
*	Time limit: 30 minutes maximum
*	If no contact: Assume compromise, surface
*	Flare signals as absolute last resort

You're absolutely right. Let me create a concise, exportable summary:

# COASTAL SAHUAGIN THREAT - SESSION SUMMARY

## Quick Overview
**Party**: Johannes (Warlock 8), Kessa (Rogue 5/Bard 2), Cyrus (Cleric 7)
**Duration**: ~6 days
**Location**: Coastal villages ? Ak-Thyln naval city
**Status**: Preparing for dawn reconnaissance mission into aboleth's lair

---

## What Happened

### Act 1: Village Attacks
- Fishing village under attack by sahuagin using cursed items (shells, coins, 
masks)
- Items enchanted victims to sleepwalk toward ocean
- Beach battle: Killed sahuagin priestess + 6 warriors, saved 3 villagers
- **Casualties**: Johannes took 32 damage, used healing

### Act 2: Cave Assault
- Johannes scouted cave (2 miles north), found main nest
- Party used *Water Breathing*, assaulted underwater nest during sahuagin 
raid on empty town
- Major battle: 8 warriors + massive chieftain
- **Critical moment**: Johannes dropped to -5 HP, Cyrus saved him with 
emergency healing
- Killed chieftain, remaining warriors fled
- **Used**: Both Potions of Greater Healing

### Act 3: Intelligence Gathered
**Maps found showing**:
- THREE villages targeted (not just one)
- Offshore location marked (5-6 miles out, 200 ft deep)
- References to "Kh'leth the Deep One"

**Evidence**:
- Mass-production workshop for cursed items
- Ritual notes about "when stars align"
- *Silver Catch* crew confirmed dead (eaten)
- This was just a forward base for something bigger

**Actions**: Evacuated all three coastal villages (~400 people saved)

### Act 4: Ak-Thyln
**3-day ride to naval city for support**

**Research discovered**:
- Kh'leth = ancient aboleth, bound 1,000+ years ago
- **TIMELINE**: Planetary conjunction in 3 WEEKS (binding weakens)
- Aboleth powers: mental domination, mucus transformation (breathe water NOT 
air = drown on land)
- **Weakness discovered**: Aboleth's own mucus can be used against it

**Mission approved**: Admiral Kethren committed ship (*Stormbreaker*) + party 
+ temple support for reconnaissance

---

## Key Mechanics/Threats

### Aboleth (Kh'leth)
- 20-foot eel creature, 4 tentacles
- **Mental domination**: Permanent enslavement via mucus contact
- **Mucus transformation**: Touch = breathe water NOT air (requires *Lesser 
Restoration*)
- **Psychic attacks**: Direct mind damage
- **Lair powers**: Controls water, creates illusions, probes minds
- **Ancient intelligence**: Plans in centuries, never forgets

### Party Protections
- **Johannes**: Ring of Mind Shielding = IMMUNE to mental domination
- **Kessa**: Will get *Protection from Evil and Good* (advantage vs 
aberrations)
- **Cyrus**: Has *Lesser Restoration* ready (counters mucus transformation)

---

## Character Changes

### Johannes
**New Equipment**:
- **Trident of Warning** (from chieftain) - attuned
  - +1 weapon, advantage on initiative, party can't be surprised
- Gave Rope of Entanglement to Cyrus

**Consumables Used**: 
- 2x Potions of Greater Healing (replaced with 2x standard healing potions)

**Mission Role**: Primary scout (invisible via *One with Shadows*, immune to 
mental domination)

### Kessa
**Adapted for underwater**:
- Javelins x4 (crossbow useless underwater)
- Harpoon (already killed multiple sahuagin with it)
- Short sword backup

**Vulnerability**: Needs *Protection from Evil* spell (not immune to 
domination like Johannes)

### Cyrus  
**Equipment sacrifice**:
- Switched chain mail ? studded leather (can't swim in heavy armor)
- Lost ~3-4 AC for mobility

**New attunement**: Rope of Entanglement (from Johannes)

**Critical spells**:
- *Water Breathing* (enables mission)
- *Lesser Restoration* (only cure for mucus transformation)
- *Protection from Evil and Good* (will cast on Kessa)

---

## Tomorrow's Mission (Next Session)

### The Plan
**Ship**: *Stormbreaker* (fast sloop, 30 crew, Captain Andra)
**Objective**: Scout aboleth's lair, assess threat, determine timeline 
urgency
**Depth**: 200 feet underwater
**Rules**: Stealth reconnaissance only, NO combat unless survival requires

### Tactics
1. **Johannes scouts ahead** (invisible, 50-100 ft in front)
   - *One with Shadows* = invisible in darkness
   - Check in every 10 minutes via *Message* cantrip
   
2. **Support group follows** (Cyrus, Kessa, Thessa, 2 acolytes)
   - Kessa: Elevated positions, javelin support
   - Cyrus: Healing ready, *Lesser Restoration* on standby
   - Thessa: Maintains *Protection* on Kessa

3. **If detected**: Immediate retreat (no heroics)

### Emergency Protocols
- **Mucus contact**: Surface immediately, get *Lesser Restoration* within 
minutes
- **Mental domination**: *Calm Emotions* to suppress, retreat
- **Aboleth appears**: DO NOT ENGAGE, retreat immediately
- **Johannes emergency escape**: *Dimension Door* (500 ft teleport to 
surface)

### Success = Determine Timeline
- **3 weeks**: Binding holds, time to prepare proper assault
- **Days**: Binding breaking, immediate action needed
- **Hours**: Already free, emergency response required

---

## Active Quests

**PRIMARY**: Reconnaissance mission (starts next session)
**SECONDARY**: Coordinate Ak-Thyln/Haven alliance (after mission)
**ONGOING**: Break Johannes's fiendish pact (~9 months until next tribute)

---

## Current Status

**Location**: Ak-Thyln temple quarters, evening before mission
**Party**: Fully rested (long rest), equipped, prepared
**Departure**: Dawn on *Stormbreaker*
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL (3-week deadline before conjunction)

---

## Key Items

### Johannes
- Ring of Mind Shielding (mental immunity)
- Amulet of Health (CON 19, 66 HP)
- Trident of Warning (new, +1 weapon, advantage initiative)
- Cloak of Manta Ray (swim speed, water breathing)
- Sending Stone (paired with Laurana at Haven)

### Party Shared

---

*Timeline: 3 weeks until catastrophic conjunction*
This is about 1/10th the length while keeping all critical information. Would 
you like me to trim it further or adjust anything?
