Look# COASTAL SAHUAGIN THREAT - SESSION SUMMARY
## Quick Overview **Party**: Johannes (Warlock 8), Kessa (Rogue 5/Bard 2), 
Cyrus (Cleric 7) **Duration**: ~6 days **Location**: Coastal villages ? Ak-Thyln 
naval city **Status**: Preparing for dawn reconnaissance mission into aboleth's 
lair
---
## What Happened
### Act 1: Village Attacks - Fishing village under attack by sahuagin using 
cursed items (shells, coins, masks) - Items enchanted victims to sleepwalk 
toward ocean - Beach battle: Killed sahuagin priestess + 6 warriors, saved 3 
villagers - **Casualties**: Johannes took 32 damage, used healing
### Act 2: Cave Assault - Johannes scouted cave (2 miles north), found main 
nest - Party used *Water Breathing*, assaulted underwater nest during 
sahuagin raid on empty town - Major battle: 8 warriors + massive chieftain - 
**Critical moment**: Johannes dropped to -5 HP, Cyrus saved him with 
emergency healing - Killed chieftain, remaining warriors fled - **Used**: Both 
Potions of Greater Healing
### Act 3: Intelligence Gathered **Maps found showing**: - THREE villages 
targeted (not just one) - Offshore location marked (5-6 miles out, 200 ft deep) 
- References to "Khû'leth the Deep One"
**Evidence**: - Mass-production workshop for cursed items - Ritual notes 
about "when stars align" - *Silver Catch* crew confirmed dead (eaten) - This 
was just a forward base for something bigger
**Actions**: Evacuated all three coastal villages (~400 people saved)
### Act 4: Ak-Thyln **3-day ride to naval city for support**
**Research discovered**: - Khû'leth = ancient aboleth, bound 1,000+ years 
ago - **TIMELINE**: Planetary conjunction in 3 WEEKS (binding weakens) - 
Aboleth powers: mental domination, mucus transformation (breathe water 
NOT air = drown on land) - **Weakness discovered**: Aboleth's own mucus 
can be used against it
**Mission approved**: Admiral Kethren committed ship (*Stormbreaker*) + 
party + temple support for reconnaissance
---
## Key Mechanics/Threats
### Aboleth (Khû'leth) - 20-foot eel creature, 4 tentacles - **Mental 
domination**: Permanent enslavement via mucus contact - **Mucus 
transformation**: Touch = breathe water NOT air (requires *Lesser 
Restoration*) - **Psychic attacks**: Direct mind damage - **Lair powers**: 
Controls water, creates illusions, probes minds - **Ancient intelligence**: Plans 
in centuries, never forgets
### Party Protections - **Johannes**: Ring of Mind Shielding = IMMUNE to 
mental domination - **Kessa**: Will get *Protection from Evil and Good* 
(advantage vs aberrations) - **Cyrus**: Has *Lesser Restoration* ready 
(counters mucus transformation)
---
## Character Changes
### Johannes **New Equipment**: - **Trident of Warning** (from chieftain) - 
attuned - +1 weapon, advantage on initiative, party can't be surprised - Gave 
Rope of Entanglement to Cyrus
**Consumables Used**: - 2x Potions of Greater Healing (replaced with 2x 
standard healing potions)
**Mission Role**: Primary scout (invisible via *One with Shadows*, immune to 
mental domination)
### Kessa **Adapted for underwater**: - Javelins x4 (crossbow useless 
underwater) - Harpoon (already killed multiple sahuagin with it) - Short sword 
backup
**Vulnerability**: Needs *Protection from Evil* spell (not immune to 
domination like Johannes)
### Cyrus **Equipment sacrifice**: - Switched chain mail ? studded leather 
(can't swim in heavy armor) - Lost ~3-4 AC for mobility
**New attunement**: Rope of Entanglement (from Johannes)
**Critical spells**: - *Water Breathing* (enables mission) - *Lesser Restoration* 
(only cure for mucus transformation) - *Protection from Evil and Good* (will 
cast on Kessa)
---
## Tomorrow's Mission (Next Session)
### The Plan **Ship**: *Stormbreaker* (fast sloop, 30 crew, Captain Andra) 
**Objective**: Scout aboleth's lair, assess threat, determine timeline urgency 
**Depth**: 200 feet underwater **Rules**: Stealth reconnaissance only, NO 
combat unless survival requires
### Tactics 1. **Johannes scouts ahead** (invisible, 50-100 ft in front) - *One 
with Shadows* = invisible in darkness - Check in every 10 minutes via 
*Message* cantrip
1.	**Support group follows** (Cyrus, Kessa, Thessa, 2 acolytes) 
*	Kessa: Elevated positions, javelin support
*	Cyrus: Healing ready, *Lesser Restoration* on standby
*	Thessa: Maintains *Protection* on Kessa
2.	**If detected**: Immediate retreat (no heroics)
### Emergency Protocols - **Mucus contact**: Surface immediately, get 
*Lesser Restoration* within minutes - **Mental domination**: *Calm Emotions* 
to suppress, retreat - **Aboleth appears**: DO NOT ENGAGE, retreat 
immediately - **Johannes emergency escape**: *Dimension Door* (500 ft 
teleport to surface)
### Success = Determine Timeline - **3 weeks**: Binding holds, time to 
prepare proper assault - **Days**: Binding breaking, immediate action needed 
- **Hours**: Already free, emergency response required
---
## Active Quests
**PRIMARY**: Reconnaissance mission (starts next session) **SECONDARY**: 
Coordinate Ak-Thyln/Haven alliance (after mission) **ONGOING**: Break 
Johannes's fiendish pact (~9 months until next tribute)
---
## Current Status
**Location**: Ak-Thyln temple quarters, evening before mission **Party**: Fully 
rested (long rest), equipped, prepared **Departure**: Dawn on *Stormbreaker* 
**Threat Level**: CRITICAL (3-week deadline before conjunction)
---
## Key Items
### Johannes - Ring of Mind Shielding (mental immunity) - Amulet of Health 
(CON 19, 66 HP) - Trident of Warning (new, +1 weapon, advantage initiative) - 
Cloak of Manta Ray (swim speed, water breathing) - Sending Stone (paired 
with Laurana at Haven) - Emergency: *Dimension Door* scroll + spell
### Party Shared - Healing potions distributed (2-4 total) - Waterproof signal 
flares - Diving equipment (weighted belts, knives) - Sealed vials for mucus

SESSION READY - ABOLETH 
RECONNAISSANCE
Perfect summary - I have everything loaded. Let me set the scene for dawn 
departure...
 
THE MISSION BEGINS
The pre-dawn darkness over Ak-Thyln harbor carries an unusual stillness. No 
gulls cry. Even the waves seem muted against the docks.
You stand on the deck of the Stormbreaker as Captain Andra's crew makes 
final preparations. The fast sloop is stripped down for speed - minimal cargo, 
maximum maneuverability. Thirty experienced sailors move with quiet 
efficiency, checking rigging and stowing gear.
Cyrus finishes his pre-mission prayers at the bow, now wearing studded 
leather instead of his familiar chain mail. He looks lighter, more mobile - but 
also more vulnerable.
Kessa tests the balance of her javelins one more time, the harpoon strapped 
to her back. She catches your eye and offers a slight nod - ready, but you can 
see the tension in her shoulders. This isn't like infiltrating a Dragon Army 
camp. You can't pick locks underwater or talk your way past an aboleth.
Thessa of the Sapphire Heart - the senior temple cleric assigned to your 
group - stands amidships with her two acolytes, reviewing spell preparations. 
She's in her fifties, grey-haired, with the calm competence of someone who's 
faced aberrations before. She notices your attention:
"Commander Constantinius. The temple's records on Khû'leth are... sparse. 
Most who encountered it didn't return to update them." She doesn't say it to 
frighten you, just stating fact. "Your immunity to its mental dominion may be 
the only reason this mission is possible at all."
Captain Andra descends from the helm: "We'll reach the coordinates in about 
two hours. Current's favorable. Once we're on station, I'll maintain position 
while you dive." She glances at the horizon where the first hint of grey suggests 
approaching dawn. "Weather's clear, sea's calm. If there's a good day to do 
this, today's it."
The ship's bell rings twice. Sailors begin casting off mooring lines.
Johannes, you have about two hours before you'll be descending 200 feet 
into darkness to scout an ancient horror's lair.
What are you doing during the voyage? Any last preparations, 
conversations, or thoughts before you dive into the deep?
If the aboleth is fixated on this mission, what might we offer to dissuade it? 
Think Kisanith and Pax Tharkas. Killing isn't always the answer. Just Kessa and 
Cyrus
Dec 9
Johannes moves to where Kessa and Cyrus stand near the rail, keeping his 
voice low enough that the crew won't overhear.
"A thought that's been nagging at me since we left the temple archives." He 
glances between them. "What if there's a Khisanth solution here?"
Kessa's eyebrows rise slightly. "Negotiate with an aboleth? That's... ambitious 
even for you."
"Hear me out. Khisanth wanted territory, recognition, to be left alone to rule 
her domain. We gave her Pax Tharkas - something we couldn't hold anyway - 
and gained a permanent enemy for the Dragon Army." Johannes taps the rail 
thoughtfully. "What does an ancient aboleth want after a thousand years of 
imprisonment?"
Cyrus frowns, considering. "The texts said aboleths are... what was the phrase? 
'Architects of civilizations, shapers of lesser minds.' They don't just kill - they 
dominate, control, build empires of thralls."
"Exactly. So why is Khû'leth using sahuagin to kidnap coastal villagers? That's 
not empire-building - that's desperation. Gathering forces before the binding 
breaks fully." Johannes keeps his eyes on the horizon. "What if it's not trying 
to conquer - what if it just wants to be free?"
Kessa's expression shifts from skepticism to consideration. "What would we 
even offer? 'Please don't enslave humanity and we'll... what?'"
What's Johannes proposing? Does he have specific terms in mind, 
or is he thinking through the logic of whether negotiation is even 
possible with something this alien and ancient?
Brainstorm in case the opportunity presents itselfand I can't speak with you
Dec 9
Johannes leans against the rail, thinking aloud. "Right. So if the moment 
comes and I'm face-to-face with something that thinks in centuries..."
Cyrus crosses his arms. "You'd need to offer something it actually values. 
Aboleths aren't like dragons - they don't hoard gold. They 
collect knowledge, secrets, influence."
"Territory," Kessa suggests. "Like Khisanth. These waters are already its 
domain - we can't take them from it anyway. Maybe formal recognition? The 
coastal cities agree to stay away from certain areas, no ships, no fishing, in 
exchange for leaving the settlements alone."
"That could work," Johannes nods slowly. "Especially if the alternative is the 
combined naval forces of Ak-Thyln and Haven hunting it down. An aboleth 
that's been bound for a millennium might prefer guaranteed isolation to 
constant warfare."
Cyrus looks uncomfortable. "There's a darker possibility. What if it wants 
thralls? Not to conquer everything, but... tribute. Like your patron." He 
grimaces at the comparison. "A certain number of willing subjects per year in 
exchange for peace."
"Absolutely not," Johannes says flatly. "I won't negotiate another version of 
my curse onto innocent people."
"Agreed," Kessa says quickly. "But knowledge... that's interesting. What do we 
know that an imprisoned aboleth doesn't?"
Johannes's eyes sharpen. "The Dragon War. A thousand years of history it 
missed. The Cataclysm. The current political landscape. Where the Dragon 
Armies are, what they're doing..." He pauses. "Information about threats to its 
domain. If it wants to rebuild an empire of thralls, it needs to know who its 
competitors are."
"Magical artifacts?" Cyrus suggests. "Not to use against us, but... ancient 
aboleth magic is lost. Maybe there are items in Ak-Thyln's vaults or Haven's 
archives that would interest it. Things we consider dangerous curiosities."
Kessa taps her fingers on the rail. "What about the binding itself? We learned 
it's weakening because of the conjunction. What if we offered to help modify it 
rather than maintain it? Not imprisoned, but... contained to specific 
boundaries. A compromise between total freedom and total binding."
"Would require cooperation from both sides," Johannes muses. "Mages from 
the temples, the aboleth's own understanding of the magic... That could 
actually work. It gets freedom of movement in deep waters, we get protection 
for coastal populations."
Cyrus nods slowly. "The temple might accept that. Better than either 
catastrophic escape or constant warfare."
"Leverage," Johannes continues. "What's our actual bargaining position? 
We're scouting because if it breaks free in three weeks, the combined fleets 
can't stop it immediately. But if we give it three weeks unmolested, let the 
binding fully collapse naturally, then coordinate a proper sealing ritual 
afterward..." He shakes his head. "That's risky. We'd need trust."
"Which aboleths aren't known for," Kessa points out.
"No, but they're known for long-term planning. If we can demonstrate that 
cooperation serves its interests better than domination..." Johannes trails off. 
"The real question is whether it's already too far gone. If it's been planning this 
escape for centuries, gathering sahuagin armies, preparing to reclaim lost 
empire... we might be too late for diplomacy."
"And there's the mucus," Cyrus says quietly. "One touch and you're breathing 
water, drowning in air. Even if it wants to negotiate, its very nature makes 
peaceful contact nearly impossible. You're immune to the mental domination, 
but not the physical transformation."
Johannes grimaces. "So terms we could offer: territory recognition, historical 
knowledge, magical artifacts, modified binding, guaranteed isolation, 
information about modern threats. Our leverage: combined naval response, 
time until the conjunction, knowledge of the binding magic."
"And our weaknesses," Kessa adds pragmatically, "are that we can't actually 
enforce any of this if it decides to just enslave everyone anyway, and we're 
utterly outmatched in direct confrontation."
"Which means," Johannes concludes, "if negotiation is possible at all, it has to 
be based on convincing Khû'leth that cooperation advances its goals better 
than domination. That peace lets it rebuild power safely while war leaves it 
vulnerable to organized opposition."
Cyrus looks out at the lightening horizon. "It's worth considering. But 
Johannes... be careful. Aboleths are alien. They don't think like dragons or 
demons or even mortals. What seems like negotiation to us might be it 
simply... playing with its food."
"Noted," Johannes says grimly. "But I'd rather try and fail than not try at all."
The three of you fall into thoughtful silence as the Stormbreaker 
cuts through the waves toward the coordinates. Within the hour, 
you'll know whether you're facing a mindless monster or 
something that can still be reasoned with.
Any final preparations before arrival?
Share these ideas with Thessa to gauge her reaction
Dec 9
Johannes crosses the deck to where Thessa stands reviewing her spell 
components. The senior cleric looks up as he approaches.
"Priestess Thessa, a moment of your time? I'd value the temple's perspective 
on something."
"Of course, Commander." She nods to her acolytes, who step away to give you 
privacy.
Johannes outlines the thinking - the Khisanth precedent, potential terms an 
aboleth might value, the possibility of modified containment rather than total 
binding or total freedom. He keeps it concise, practical.
Thessa listens without interrupting, her expression growing more thoughtful 
as he speaks. When he finishes, she's quiet for a long moment, watching the 
wake behind the ship.
"Your tactical mind is why Admiral Kethren trusted you with this mission," 
she says finally. "But I need to be honest about what you're considering."
She turns to face him fully. "First, the pragmatic: if such terms could be 
reached, the temple would likely support them. We're not fools - we know we 
can't simply kill an aboleth at the height of its power, especially not in its own 
lair. A negotiated containment is infinitely preferable to coastal cities being 
transformed into thrall colonies."
"But?" Johannes prompts, hearing the hesitation.
"But aboleths are not dragons, Commander. I've studied the fragmentary 
records we have." Her voice drops lower. "Dragons are creatures of pride, 
territory, power - things we understand. Aboleths are... older. They remember 
when they ruled the world, when they created the first civilizations, shaped 
the first empires. To an aboleth, all other intelligent life exists to serve them. 
It's not cruelty or ambition - it's simply how they perceive reality."
She pauses, choosing her words carefully. "Khisanth negotiated because 
she respected your strength. You hurt her, denied her what she wanted, 
proved you were a threat. Respect leads to bargaining."
"An aboleth doesn't respect," Thessa continues. "It categorizes. You're either a 
thrall, a potential thrall, or an obstacle to be removed. The very concept of 
treating you as an equal negotiating partner would be... alien to its worldview."
Cyrus has drifted close enough to hear. "So you're saying it's impossible?"
"I'm saying it's improbable," Thessa corrects. "But improbable isn't 
impossible. If any mortal could pull off what you're suggesting..." She looks at 
Johannes with a mixture of respect and concern. "Your immunity to its mental 
dominion means you can actually speak with it without being enslaved mid-
sentence. That alone makes this possible in a way it wouldn't be for anyone 
else."
"What would give us the best chance?" Johannes asks.
Thessa considers. "Demonstrate that you understand what it truly wants. Not 
freedom - aboleths had freedom for eons before they were bound. Not 
territory - it already commands the depths. What it wants is to rebuild. To 
reclaim its rightful place as architect of civilization."
She meets his eyes. "If you can convince it that cooperation advances that goal 
better than conquest - that thralls taken by force are weak foundations 
compared to... let's call them 'willing subjects' granted through treaty - then 
perhaps. Perhaps."
"The temple would need guarantees," she adds. "Boundaries it cannot cross. 
Protections for coastal settlements. Verification methods." Her expression 
hardens slightly. "And we would need to be prepared for the possibility that it 
agrees to terms simply to buy time, then breaks them when it's strong enough. 
Aboleths think in centuries, Commander. They're patient."
Kessa speaks up from nearby. "So worst case, we buy time. Best case, we 
actually achieve containment."
"Precisely," Thessa nods. "Either outcome is better than immediate 
catastrophic escape." She looks back at Johannes. "I won't stop you from 
attempting negotiation if the opportunity presents itself. But I want you to 
understand what you're dealing with. This isn't a dragon you can impress or 
intimidate. This is something that considers you fundamentally lesser, no 
matter how powerful you are."
She places a hand on his shoulder, surprisingly warm. "That said... you've 
accomplished improbable things before. If anyone can find a way to 
communicate with something that alien, it might be you. Just remember: your 
immunity protects your mind, but not your judgment. Don't let the possibility 
of peace blind you to what it actually is."
Johannes, how do you respond? And the ship is nearly at the 
coordinates now - Captain Andra is calling for the crew to prepare 
for station-keeping.
This is all just in case, but it is something to consider.
Dec 9
"Understood, Priestess. This is contingency planning, nothing more." 
Johannes gives her a slight nod of appreciation. "I'm not going down there 
looking to negotiate - I'm going to scout, assess the threat, and return with 
actionable intelligence. But if the situation presents itself..."
"Then you'll have thought it through rather than improvising in the moment," 
Thessa finishes. "That's wise. The temple appreciates commanders who 
consider all options." She squeezes his shoulder briefly before releasing it. 
"May Mishakal grant you clarity in the depths, Commander. And may you 
return to share what you've learned."
Captain Andra's voice cuts across the deck: "Station keeping! All hands, 
prepare to hold position!"
The Stormbreaker slows, sails adjusting as the crew brings her to a stop over 
the coordinates. You're five to six miles offshore now - the coastal villages are 
distant smudges on the horizon behind you. The water here is a deep, almost 
black blue.
Kessa joins you at the rail, looking down into the dark water. "Two hundred 
feet down. Can't even see the bottom from here." She checks her javelins one 
more time - a nervous habit. "You sure about going first? Alone?"
Cyrus approaches from the other side, his medical kit secured waterproof 
against his chest. "We could all descend together. Safety in numbers."
Captain Andra climbs down from the helm, her expression serious. 
"Coordinates confirmed. We're directly over the marked location from the 
sahuagin maps. Current's stable, weather's holding." She looks at Johannes. 
"Your mission, Commander. How do you want to proceed?"
The moment has arrived. How does Johannes want to handle the 
descent? Scout ahead alone as planned, or adjust the approach? 
And any final words for Kessa and Cyrus before you go into the 
dark?
Scout alone.
Dec 9
Johannes checks his gear one final time - trident secured, cloak ready, Ring of 
Mind Shielding solid on his finger. He meets Kessa's concerned look with 
steady confidence.
"I go first. Alone. That's the plan and it's the right one." He keeps his voice 
calm, matter-of-fact. "I can be invisible down there. Silent. If something spots 
a group of five descending, we've lost the element of reconnaissance. If it spots 
me... I can vanish and they'll think they imagined it."
Cyrus nods reluctantly. "Ten minutes between Message cantrips. If we don't 
hear from you-"
"You wait another ten minutes, then assume I'm either out of range or 
compromised." Johannes looks between his two closest companions. "Don't 
come after me on a hunch. Stick to the timeline."
Kessa's jaw tightens but she doesn't argue. "And if you find it?"
"I observe. I learn. I stay invisible and stay alive." He allows himself a slight 
smile. "I've gotten rather good at that."
"Johannes." Kessa's voice drops lower, private despite the crew around them. 
"If something goes wrong down there... if the worst happens... Keys will make 
sure Laurana knows everything. About the mission, about what we learned, 
about..." She doesn't finish, but her meaning is clear. About you.
"Nothing's going wrong," Johannes says firmly, then softer: "But thank you."
Cyrus clasps his shoulder. "Mishakal's light guide you through the darkness, 
my friend. We'll be right behind you - just far enough to help, close enough to 
matter."
Thessa approaches with a small vial of silvery liquid. "Holy water, blessed for 
protection against aberrations. It won't stop an aboleth, but it might give you a 
moment's advantage if you need it." She hands it to him. "And Commander? 
Trust your immunity, but trust your instincts more. If something feels wrong, 
it probably is."
Johannes tucks the vial carefully into his waterproof pouch, then pulls the 
Cloak of Manta Ray around his shoulders. The magic tingles as it activates, 
gills forming along his neck, his movement already feeling more fluid in 
anticipation of water.
Captain Andra gestures to the rope ladder. "We'll lower you first. Once you 
signal you're ready to descend, the others wait ten minutes before following. 
Current will push you slightly north - account for that."
Johannes climbs over the rail, pausing at the top of the ladder. He looks back 
once at Kessa and Cyrus.
"See you on the other side of this."
Then he descends into the dark water.
The ocean closes over your head. The Cloak's magic fully engages - 
you can breathe easily, move naturally. Above you, the hull of 
the Stormbreaker is a dark shadow against the lighter surface. 
Below... nothing but deepening blue-black.
How deep do you descend before pausing to assess? And are you 
using any particular caution or magical preparation as you go 
down?
Sharks are drawn to motion, so my actions are smooth, unhurried, nothing 
that draws attention.
Dec 9
The descent into darkness is methodical, almost meditative. Johannes lets 
himself sink slowly, controlling his movements with the practiced economy of 
someone who's learned that survival often depends on not being noticed.
The water grows colder as you descend. Fifty feet down, the surface light 
begins to fade. You can still see the hull above, but it's distant now, wavering 
through the water column.
One hundred feet. The light is dim, blue-grey, the kind of twilight that makes 
distances hard to judge. You pause here, hanging motionless in the water, 
letting your eyes adjust. Your breath is steady through the magical gills - in, 
out, the rhythm of the ocean itself.
Nothing has reacted to your presence. No shapes dart through the peripheral 
darkness. No pressure wave of something large moving nearby.
You continue down, movements smooth and deliberate. Your dark clothing 
helps - you're just another shadow in the deepening gloom.
One hundred fifty feet. The cold is more pronounced now, seeping through 
even the magical protections. The water has weight here, pressure you can feel 
even though the Cloak protects you from being crushed by it.
You pause again, drifting, watching. Listening with more than ears - feeling for 
vibrations, changes in water pressure, anything that suggests you're not alone.
Still nothing. Just the vast, patient darkness of the deep ocean.
Two hundred feet.
The bottom finally resolves below you - not sand, but rocky seafloor broken by 
darker patches that might be crevices or caves. Formations of stone jut up like 
broken teeth. And there, perhaps a hundred feet to the north...
A structure.
Not natural. Too regular, too purposeful. Massive blocks of worked stone, 
green with age and covered in centuries of marine growth. Columns that might 
once have supported something grand, now toppled and broken. The ruins 
spread across the seafloor - what might have been a temple, or a palace, or 
something else entirely from an age before human civilization.
And at the center, where the largest structures still stand...
Darkness that seems thicker than mere absence of light. A opening 
in the stone, leading down into something deeper still.
You hang in the water fifty feet above the ruins, perfectly still, just another 
piece of drifting shadow.
Roll Perception (with advantage from your Trident of Warning) to 
observe the area carefully before approaching. What are you 
looking for specifically?
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Perception with advantage for you.
First roll: 13 + 5 (WIS modifier) = 18 Second roll (advantage): 11 + 5 
= 16
Result: 18
 
Hanging motionless in the water, you observe the ruins with methodical care, 
letting your eyes trace patterns and movement rather than forcing focus.
What you notice:
Movement patterns: Small fish dart among the ruins, but they avoid 
certain areas entirely. There's a rough perimeter about thirty feet from the 
central darkness where marine life simply... doesn't go. Not fleeing, just absent 
- as if they instinctively know not to enter.
The ruins themselves: Definitely pre-Cataclysm, possibly much older. The 
architecture is strange - angles that don't quite match human sensibilities, 
proportions that feel slightly wrong. This wasn't built by or for surface 
dwellers. The stone is carved with symbols that are heavily eroded but still 
visible in places - alien script that writhes and curves in ways that make your 
eyes want to slide away.
Water currents: There's a subtle pull toward that central darkness. Not 
strong, but constant. Water flowing into the opening, not out. Something 
down there is drawing water in - or the structure itself is designed to create 
that flow.
Guard positions: You spot them now - two sahuagin sentries, one on either 
side of the main entrance, standing in carved alcoves that provide cover. 
They're remarkably still, disciplined. Not the frenzied raiders from the beach, 
but trained guards. Their weapons are coral-studded tridents, and they wear 
what looks like ceremonial armor made of shell and bone.
They haven't seen you. You're too far above, too still, just another shadow in 
the dark water.
No sign of the aboleth itself, but that central opening descends further - 
you can't see how deep from this angle. The darkness there isn't natural; it has 
a quality to it that suggests either magical shadow or simply a shaft leading far 
deeper than light can penetrate.
Odd detail: Along the seafloor between the outer ruins and the central 
structure, there are... pathways? Cleared sections where the stone has been 
deliberately swept clean of debris and growth. They radiate out from the 
entrance like spokes of a wheel. Three of them lead to what look like smaller 
cave openings in the rocky seafloor. Supply routes, maybe? Or escape tunnels?
You've been down here for about three minutes now. The sentries haven't 
moved. The water continues its slow pull toward the darkness.
What's your next move? Continue observing from here, try to get 
closer to examine something specific, or send your 
first Message check-in to Cyrus?
Message check
Dec 9
You focus your mind, reaching out through the water with 
the Message cantrip. The magic connects easily - Cyrus is well within range.
"Two hundred feet down. Ancient ruins, pre-Cataclysm or older. Two 
sahuagin sentries at main entrance - disciplined, armed, haven't spotted me. 
Central structure has opening leading deeper, water current flowing inward. 
No sign of the aboleth yet. Proceeding with caution."
A moment's pause, then Cyrus's voice echoes in your mind, clear despite the 
distance and water between you:
"Understood. We're preparing to descend now. Will follow your path down, 
stop at one-fifty to avoid crowding you. Thessa says the water flow is 
concerning - aboleths sometimes create currents to draw prey closer. Stay 
alert. Next check-in ten minutes."
The mental connection fades. Above and behind you, you know your 
companions are now entering the water, beginning their own careful descent. 
They'll stay back, give you space to work, but they're coming.
The ruins lie before you, patient and ancient. The two sentries remain 
motionless in their alcoves. The darkness at the center continues to pull water 
slowly inward.
You have about ten minutes before your next check-in. Enough time to 
investigate something more closely, or to probe deeper toward that central 
opening.
What do you want to examine? The perimeter where fish avoid? 
One of those spoke-like pathways? Try to get closer to the sentries 
to assess their alertness? Or edge toward that central darkness to 
see what's creating the current?
The pathways, focus on the non obvious trap
Dec 9
Johannes drifts lower, angling toward one of the spoke-like pathways - 
specifically choosing the one that leads to the northeastern smaller cave 
opening, away from the sentries' direct line of sight.
He descends with the same unhurried smoothness, watching not just the 
pathway itself but the spaces around it. Traps aren't always mechanisms - 
sometimes they're positions, sight lines, responses.
The pathway is too clear. That's the first thing that strikes you. Centuries 
underwater and this stone is swept absolutely clean - no growth, no debris, no 
silt accumulation. That takes maintenance. Regular patrols, or something else 
passing through frequently enough to keep it clear.
As you drift closer, staying about twenty feet above the pathway itself, you 
notice:
Sight lines: The pathway is positioned so that anyone traveling along it 
would be visible from the central entrance for most of its length. There's a gap 
in the middle where a collapsed column provides brief cover, but otherwise - 
it's a killing field. Anyone walking this route is exposed.
The edges: The stones flanking the pathway aren't random ruins. They're 
positioned deliberately, creating a channel. Forcing movement into a specific 
corridor rather than allowing someone to pick their way through the rubble.
Shadows that aren't quite right: In several places along the pathway, 
there are darker patches among the ruins on either side. Your eyes want to 
dismiss them as just more shadows, but... they're too regular. Too consistently 
placed. Hiding spots? Or something worse?
You focus on one of those shadow-patches, drifting slightly closer while 
maintaining your distance from the pathway itself.
Roll Investigation to determine what those shadows actually 
conceal.
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Investigation for you.
Roll: 7 + 2 (INT modifier) = 9
 
You study the shadow-patches intently, but from this distance and angle, you 
can't quite make out what they are. The darkness and the way the ruins create 
overlapping shadows makes it difficult to distinguish between natural 
formation and deliberate construction.
They could be hiding spots for additional sentries. They could be alcoves 
containing something else - trapped areas, warning mechanisms, or even just 
architectural features that happen to create deep shadows.
What you can determine: whatever they are, they're consistent. Spaced at 
roughly regular intervals along each pathway, always on the sides, always 
positioned where someone traveling the route would pass close by them.
The most obvious explanation is ambush positions - places where sahuagin 
could wait in cover to intercept anyone approaching the central structure. But 
your instincts, honed by years of military tactics and recent experience with 
cursed sahuagin items, suggest there might be more to it.
To get a better look, you'd need to either:
*	Get much closer (risking detection by the sentries)
*	Approach from a different angle (time-consuming, but safer)
*	Use magic to investigate (but some spells create light or other detectable 
effects)
*	Simply note their positions and report them, letting the group decide 
how to handle them
You've been down here about six minutes now. Four minutes until your next 
check-in with Cyrus.
What's your approach? Push closer to investigate those shadows, 
move to examine a different feature of the ruins, or pull back to 
observe the overall layout before your next Message?
Come at a different angle
Dec 9
Johannes drifts laterally, circling wide around the ruins to approach the 
pathway from the side rather than from above. He keeps his movements 
minimal, using the water's natural currents to help position himself, 
conserving energy and avoiding the kind of active swimming that might draw 
attention.
The new angle takes time - you're moving slowly, carefully, keeping broken 
columns and toppled stonework between you and the sentries' position. But 
patience has kept you alive this long.
From this side approach, staying low near the seafloor but offset from the 
pathway itself, the shadows resolve more clearly:
Alcoves. Deliberately carved into the flanking stones.
But they're not empty ambush positions. Each one contains something - 
objects wrapped in what looks like preserved kelp or some kind of waterproof 
binding. The packages are roughly uniform in size, maybe two feet long, 
secured to the alcove walls with corroded metal fixtures.
They're supplies. Or equipment caches.
Stored at regular intervals along the pathway, positioned for quick access. This 
isn't a trap in the traditional sense - it's logistics. The pathways aren't just 
routes, they're supply lines.
One of the nearest caches is close enough that you could reach it without 
crossing into direct sight of the sentries - there's a tumbled section of wall 
providing cover. You could potentially examine one without being detected, 
though touching anything carries risk.
Then you notice something else:
Near one of the alcoves, partially hidden by the wrapped packages, there's a 
faint glow. Not bright, just a subtle luminescence barely visible in the deep 
darkness. Magical, almost certainly.
Some of these supplies are enchanted items.
You've been down here about eight minutes. Two minutes until your next 
check-in.
Do you risk getting close enough to examine one of the caches? Try 
to identify what that glowing item might be? Or pull back and 
report what you've learned?
Nothing worth reporting yet. Investigate more closely
Dec 9
Johannes edges closer to the nearest cache, using the tumbled wall section as 
cover. He keeps his body low, movements glacially slow, letting the natural 
sway of water currents disguise any motion.
The alcove is within arm's reach now. The wrapped packages are secured with 
what looks like copper wire, green with verdigris. The kelp wrapping is treated 
somehow - still intact after who knows how long underwater.
You can see the faint glow more clearly now. It's coming from beneath the 
wrappings of one particular package, a soft blue-green luminescence that 
pulses very gently. Magical, definitely, but what kind?
Then you hear it.
Not with your ears - with that deeper sense that comes from the Trident of 
Warning. A vibration in the water. Regular. Rhythmic.
Something is approaching along the pathway.
You freeze, perfectly still against the tumbled stones. Your dark clothing 
blends with the shadows. You're not on the pathway itself, not in the direct 
route, but you're close - maybe fifteen feet from it.
The vibration grows stronger. You can feel it now through the water - the 
pressure wave of something large moving with purpose.
Around the collapsed column, into the clear section of pathway, comes 
a sahuagin war band.
Six of them, moving in formation. But these aren't like the raiders you fought 
on the beach. These are elite guards - larger, better equipped, moving with 
military precision. Their armor is more elaborate, their weapons pristine. The 
lead sahuagin carries what looks like a ceremonial staff that glows with the 
same blue-green light as the package near you.
They're headed directly toward the central structure, following the pathway. 
They haven't seen you - you're off to the side, in shadow, motionless.
But they're going to pass within twenty feet of your position.
What do you do? Remain absolutely still and hope they pass 
without noticing? Retreat slowly while their attention is forward? 
Use One with Shadows to become invisible (though you'd need dim 
light or darkness, and movement to activate it)?
One with Shadows
Dec 9
You press yourself deeper into the shadow of the tumbled wall, feeling the 
invocation rise naturally: One with Shadows. The magic responds instantly - 
you become invisible, melting into the darkness like you were never there.
The war band continues along the pathway, their formation tight and 
professional. The lead sahuagin with the glowing staff passes closest to your 
position - perhaps eighteen feet away. His head swivels slightly, those dead 
black eyes scanning the ruins, but he sees nothing. You're shadow among 
shadows, absence rather than presence.
The six guards move past, their destination clearly the central structure. You 
watch them approach the entrance where the two sentries stand. There's a 
brief exchange - clicks and hisses in the sahuagin language, too rapid and alien 
for you to parse. The sentries step aside, and the war band descends into that 
central darkness.
The water current pulls slightly stronger as they enter, then settles back to its 
steady inward flow.
The two sentries resume their positions, motionless as statues.
You're still invisible, still pressed against the tumbled wall. The 
cache with the glowing item is right there. The pathway is clear 
again.
Two minutes have passed since your last check-in - you're slightly overdue for 
your Message to Cyrus.
Do you:
*	Send the check-in now, reporting what you just witnessed
*	Quickly examine the glowing cache first, then report
*	Follow the war band's path to see where they're going in the central 
structure
*	Pull back and reposition before checking in
Report
Dec 9
You focus your mind, reaching out through the water with Message:
"War band just passed my position. Six elite sahuagin, military formation, 
headed into central structure. Supply caches positioned along pathways - 
some items are enchanted. Sentries remain at entrance. These aren't raiders, 
Cyrus - this is an organized military operation. Infrastructure, logistics, 
discipline."
A brief pause, then Cyrus's response comes through, his mental voice tight 
with concern:
"Understood. We're at one-fifty feet, holding position. Thessa says organized 
forces suggest the aboleth is actively commanding them - already awake and 
planning, not just breaking free. That changes our timeline assessment. Can 
you determine how many more sahuagin are down there? And Johannes... 
that war band went inside. Be extremely careful about following."
The connection fades.
You remain invisible against the tumbled wall, considering your options. The 
sentries haven't moved. The pathway is clear again. That glowing cache is still 
right there, easily reachable.
But Cyrus's words echo in your mind: already awake and planning. This isn't 
a creature barely conscious, waiting for the binding to break. This is an active 
operation - guards, patrols, supply lines, military structure.
The question is: how deep does this go? How many sahuagin are gathered 
here? And what exactly is Khû'leth planning for when that conjunction arrives 
in three weeks?
What's your next move?
Trace the war band backward, where did they come from?
Dec 9
Smart thinking. Johannes moves carefully along the pathway in reverse, 
following the route the war band took to reach the central structure. You stay 
invisible, drifting low and slow, using the tumbled ruins for cover even though 
the magic should keep you hidden.
The pathway leads northeast, away from the central structure, toward one of 
those smaller cave openings you spotted earlier. As you follow it, you notice 
more of those supply caches - at least four more alcoves, all stocked with 
wrapped packages, some showing that faint magical glow.
The pathway ends at a cave mouth - natural formation, maybe fifteen feet 
across, leading into darkness. Unlike the worked stone of the central ruins, 
this is raw rock, though the entrance has been cleared and widened somewhat.
You pause at the threshold, listening, feeling for vibrations in the water.
There's movement inside. Distant, but present. The pressure waves 
suggest multiple bodies, perhaps some kind of activity or patrol deeper in the 
cave system.
Then you notice something else: scratches on the rock near the 
entrance. Recent ones, cutting through the marine growth. Tally marks, 
maybe? Or some kind of record-keeping. There are dozens of them, organized 
in clusters.
And near the cave floor, partially obscured by silt: tracks. Not just sahuagin 
prints, but drag marks. Something heavy being pulled in or out regularly.
Roll Perception to examine the area around the cave entrance 
more carefully - what else can you learn about this location before 
deciding whether to probe deeper?
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Perception with advantage (Trident of Warning) for you.
First roll: 18 + 5 = 23 Second roll: 4 + 5 = 9
Result: 23 - Excellent!
 
Your careful examination reveals several critical details:
The tally marks aren't random - they're organized into groups of five with a 
diagonal slash, counting something. You count at least eight complete groups, 
plus three additional marks. Forty-three. Recent enough that marine growth 
hasn't obscured them. Patrols? Tribute deliveries? Prisoners taken?
The drag marks are more telling up close. They're consistent with the size 
and weight of a human body - or multiple bodies. The tracks lead into the 
cave, not out. And there are multiple sets, overlapping, some newer than 
others. The silt pattern suggests regular traffic over days or weeks.
Shell fragments scattered near the entrance - broken pieces of those cursed 
items you found in the sahuagin nest. Some still show traces of the 
enchantment, though they're inert now. This cave is connected to the cursed 
item production. Either a workshop, or a staging area for distribution.
Most critically: You spot something partially buried in the silt near the cave 
wall. You drift closer, brush away sediment carefully.
A holy symbol. Small, silver, tarnished but recognizable - the balanced 
scales of Gilean, god of knowledge and neutrality. The chain is broken. This 
belonged to a cleric or scholar.
It's recent. Days old, maybe a week at most.
Someone from the coastal settlements - or perhaps from a ship - was brought 
here. Alive when they arrived, given the drag marks. And they're somewhere 
inside this cave system now.
The implications: This isn't just a forward military base. They're taking 
captives. The forty-three tally marks might represent prisoners, not patrols. 
And if there are people still alive in there...
You've been down here about twelve minutes total. Your invisibility is still 
active. The cave opening yawns before you, darkness leading deeper into the 
rock. You can hear/feel that distant activity inside - movement, possibly voices 
though the water distorts sound.
What do you do?
Enter the cave
Dec 9
Johannes slips into the cave entrance, invisible and silent. The darkness here 
is absolute - no surface light penetrates this deep, this far into solid rock. But 
your eyes have adjusted to the depths, and there's a faint bioluminescence 
from some kind of algae or fungi clinging to the walls, just enough to navigate 
by.
The cave tunnel slopes downward, widening as it goes. The drag marks 
continue along the floor, multiple overlapping trails all heading deeper. You 
follow them, one hand trailing along the rough stone wall to orient yourself, 
moving with exquisite care.
The tunnel curves, descends another twenty feet, then opens into a larger 
chamber.
You stop at the threshold, taking it in.
The chamber is perhaps forty feet across, with a ceiling lost in darkness above. 
More of that faint bioluminescence provides ghostly illumination - enough to 
see shapes, movement, horror.
Cages.
Crude but effective - bars made from coral and bone, lashed together with wire 
and kelp rope. There are six of them arranged along the far wall.
And they're occupied.
You count quickly: Eleven people. Humans, mostly, though you think you 
see a dwarf in one cage. They're huddled together, some sitting in drugged 
stupor, others awake but listless. Their clothing marks them as fishermen, 
sailors, coastal villagers. Several show signs of the cursed items' influence - 
glazed eyes, slack expressions, the remnants of enchantment not fully worn 
off.
Two sahuagin guards stand watch near the cages, armed with tridents. 
They're alert but not expecting trouble - this is routine guard duty for them.
But that's not what makes your blood run cold.
In the center of the chamber, there's a pool - a depression in the stone floor 
filled with seawater that glows with sickly green phosphorescence. And lying 
in that pool, partially submerged, is a human woman. She's conscious, but her 
skin has a translucent quality, her breathing labored. Her fingers and toes 
show webbing between them that wasn't there naturally.
She's being transformed. The mucus. The aboleth's mucus. They're 
changing her, slowly, methodically. Making her something that can breathe 
water, serve in the depths permanently.
Near the pool, there's a stone table with more of those wrapped packages - 
cursed items in various stages of creation. A workshop, just as you suspected. 
And on the floor beside it: More holy symbols. A ship captain's 
insignia. Personal effects from at least a dozen different people.
The forty-three tally marks weren't just prisoners taken. They were 
prisoners processed.
Where are the other thirty-two?
The two guards haven't noticed you. The prisoners are too drugged 
or despairing to raise alarm. You're still invisible.
What do you do?
Is there evidence of the mucus present, something that can be collected?
Dec 9
You scan the chamber carefully, looking for the aboleth's mucus - Thessa 
mentioned it could be used against the creature, and having a sample would 
be invaluable.
The glowing pool where the woman is transforming - that greenish 
phosphorescence isn't just algae or magic. The water itself has a viscous 
quality, slightly thicker than normal seawater. That's almost certainly mucus-
contaminated water, though diluted.
More promising: Along the stone table where the cursed items are being 
assembled, there are small clay vessels - sealed pots about the size of your 
fist. Three of them. One is open, and you can see thick, translucent gel inside 
that gleams with that same sickly green glow. Pure mucus, or close to it. 
Concentrated.
The sahuagin must be collecting it from the aboleth directly, then using it 
either for transforming captives or possibly as a component in creating the 
cursed items.
The sealed pots are within reach - maybe twelve feet from your current 
position at the chamber entrance. You'd need to move past one of the guards 
(about eight feet away from the table) to get to them. The guard is facing the 
cages, not the table, but any disturbance of the water or sound would alert 
him.
You have one of those sealed vials Thessa gave you for collecting 
samples. It would hold perhaps a quarter of what's in one of those 
clay pots - more than enough for analysis and potential use.
The challenge: Getting to the table, collecting a sample, and getting out 
without alerting two armed guards who are standing in an enclosed space with 
limited escape routes.
Do you attempt it? And if so, how do you approach - quickly and 
quietly, or with extreme patience?
Mage hand?
Dec 9
Perfect solution. You focus carefully, invoking Mage Hand - the spectral, 
translucent force appearing near the stone table. It's faint enough in the dim 
bioluminescence that it might go unnoticed if you're careful.
Roll Stealth with advantage (you're invisible) to maneuver the 
Mage Hand to collect a sample without drawing attention. The 
guards are alert but focused on the prisoners, and any unusual 
sound or water disturbance could alert them.
The hand can lift up to 10 pounds and manipulate objects - easily enough to 
uncork your vial, scoop mucus from the open pot, and seal it again.
What's your approach:
*	Move the hand slowly and carefully (lower chance of detection but takes 
more time)
*	Work quickly to minimize exposure time (faster but potentially noisier)
Give me your approach and I'll roll.
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Stealth with advantage for you, assuming a careful, patient approach.
First roll: 19 + 5 = 24 Second roll: 6 + 5 = 11
Result: 24 - Excellent!
 
The spectral hand materializes near the stone table, barely visible even to you. 
You manipulate it with exquisite precision - decades of military command 
translated into careful, deliberate magical control.
The hand retrieves your sample vial from your pouch, uncorks it with a 
faint tink that gets lost in the ambient water sounds. It dips into the open clay 
pot, scooping a generous portion of the thick, glowing mucus. The substance is 
viscous, clinging to itself as the hand transfers it carefully into your vial.
One of the guards shifts slightly, and you freeze the hand mid-motion. The 
sahuagin makes a clicking sound to his companion, but he's commenting on 
something about the prisoners - not investigating anything unusual.
The hand completes its work, sealing your vial and returning it to your pouch. 
The entire operation takes perhaps thirty seconds, smooth and undetected.
You now have a sample of pure aboleth mucus.
As the magical hand dissipates, you take stock of the situation:
*	11 prisoners in various states of distress
*	1 woman actively being transformed in the mucus pool
*	2 guards who haven't noticed anything amiss
*	32 unaccounted captives from the tally marks
*	Evidence of systematic abduction and transformation
This is worse than just a military staging ground. This is infrastructure for 
building an army of transformed thralls.
You're still invisible, still undetected. But you've been in this cave for several 
minutes now, and you're due for another check-in with Cyrus soon.
Do you:
*	Investigate further to find where the other 32 captives are
*	Attempt to gather more intelligence from this chamber
*	Withdraw and report what you've found
*	Something else
2 more vials, then retreat.
Dec 9
Practical thinking - three samples provide redundancy and multiple uses. You 
summon Mage Hand again, this time with even more confidence after the 
successful first collection.
The spectral hand retrieves two more vials from your pouch, working with the 
same careful precision. The open clay pot still has plenty of mucus - this 
material is apparently being stored in quantity.
First vial: filled and sealed smoothly.
Second vial: the hand dips in again-
One of the guards turns. Not toward the table, but toward the tunnel entrance 
where you're positioned. He clicks something to his companion, gesturing 
with his trident.
He's not looking at you - you're still invisible. But he's 
sensed something. A change in water pressure, maybe. A disturbance in the 
current. Predator instinct.
The Mage Hand is still holding the second vial over the pot, mucus dripping 
from the opening.
The guard takes a step toward the entrance, his black eyes scanning. His 
companion raises his weapon slightly, alert now.
Quick decision needed:
*	Complete the collection (another 5-10 seconds, but higher risk of 
detection)
*	Seal the partial vial now and dismiss the hand immediately
*	Dismiss the hand and abandon the second vial to avoid any further 
disturbance
What do you do?
Complete
Dec 9
The spectral hand continues its work with deliberate calm - rushing now 
would only create more disturbance. It finishes filling the second vial, seals it 
with practiced precision, and returns both containers to your pouch.
The guard is now ten feet from the tunnel entrance, his trident held ready. 
He's searching, but his eyes pass right over you - invisible in shadow, 
motionless as stone.
He clicks sharply - a questioning sound.
His companion responds from deeper in the chamber, equally alert now. The 
prisoners stir slightly, sensing the tension.
The Mage Hand dissipates silently.
You remain absolutely still. The guard is close enough now that you could 
reach out and touch him. His gills flutter as he tastes the water for any 
chemical signature. His head swivels, scanning.
Ten seconds pass. Twenty.
Finally, he makes a dismissive grunt and turns back toward the chamber, 
though his posture remains more alert than before. He exchanges a few more 
clicks with his companion - something about currents, water flow, nothing to 
worry about.
You have three vials of pure aboleth mucus secured.
The guards are now heightened alert status, but they haven't raised any alarm. 
They think it was nothing - just the paranoia that comes from guard duty in a 
dark cave.
Time to leave.
You ease backward into the tunnel, maintaining your invisibility, moving with 
the kind of patience that's kept you alive through worse situations than this. 
The bioluminescent algae guides your way back up the sloping passage.
Behind you, you hear one of the prisoners whimper softly. The woman in the 
transformation pool gasps. Eleven people who need rescue. Thirty-two more 
unaccounted for.
But you have what you came for - intelligence, evidence, and samples that 
might be crucial to stopping this.
You emerge from the cave mouth back onto the seafloor. The pathway 
stretches before you, leading back toward the central structure. The two 
sentries remain at their posts, unaware of your infiltration.
Time check: You've been down here about 18 minutes total. 
Overdue for another Message to Cyrus.
Do you report now, or investigate something else first?
Report
Dec 9
You focus your mind, reaching out with Message:
"Cyrus. Cave system northeast of central structure. Eleven prisoners in cages 
- villagers, sailors. They're transforming captives with aboleth mucus, 
making them water-breathers. I collected samples. Tally marks suggest 
forty-three total taken - thirty-two unaccounted for. This isn't just military 
staging. They're building a thrall army. Two guards in the chamber, didn't 
detect me."
The response comes quickly, Cyrus's mental voice tight with urgency:
"Gods above. Thessa says if they're mass-producing thralls, the aboleth is 
preparing for immediate action after the binding breaks - not long-term 
planning. We need to know its current state. Is it already free? Still bound 
but conscious? Johannes, we're at your position now, one-seventy-five feet. 
Can see the ruins below. What's your assessment - do we pull back and 
report, or push for the central structure?"
A valid question. You've gathered critical intelligence:
*	Organized military operation with elite guards
*	Systematic abduction and transformation of prisoners
*	Supply infrastructure and magical item production
*	Evidence of immediate post-freedom plans
But you still haven't answered the core question: What is Khû'leth's actual 
status? Is it still bound, merely conscious and planning? Or has the binding 
already weakened enough that it's partially free?
That answer lies in the central structure, where that war band descended into 
darkness.
What do you tell Cyrus? Recommend withdrawal with what you've 
learned, or push deeper to assess the aboleth's actual condition?
I will drink potion of invisibility and head into the large dark entrance; I don't 
think we have enough info to be able to make real strategic planning at this 
point.
Dec 9
You pull the Potion of Invisibility from your waterproof pouch - more reliable 
than One with Shadows, and it'll last a full hour regardless of your actions. 
The liquid glows faintly as you uncork it, and you down it in one smooth 
motion.
The magic takes hold immediately, more complete than your shadow 
invocation. You look down - nothing. Not even a shimmer. Perfect.
Message to Cyrus: "Drinking invisibility potion, investigating central 
structure. Need to know the aboleth's actual status - everything else is just 
guessing. If I don't report in twenty minutes, assume compromise and 
withdraw. Get those prisoners' locations to the Admiral. Don't come after 
me."
Brief pause, then: "Understood. Twenty minutes. Mishakal guard you, my 
friend. We'll be ready to move if you need extraction."
The connection fades.
Johannes moves across the open seafloor toward the central structure, 
completely invisible now. The two sentries don't even twitch as you pass 
within fifteen feet of their positions.
The entrance looms before you - that darkness that's more than mere absence 
of light. The water current pulls steadily inward, stronger here at the 
threshold. You can feel the age of this place, the weight of centuries pressing 
down through the water.
The worked stone around the entrance is carved with those alien symbols, 
more elaborate here. They seem to writhe at the edge of your vision, meaning 
just beyond comprehension.
You cross the threshold.
The darkness swallows you.
Even with your darkvision adjusting, it takes a moment to make sense of what 
you're seeing. The passage descends steeply - not a gradual slope but a 
deliberate shaft, carved smooth. Handholds have been cut into the walls for 
sahuagin to use, but the design predates them by millennia.
You descend carefully, using the handholds yourself to control your movement 
against the inward current.
Fifty feet down. One hundred feet. The pressure increases, the cold deepens. 
You're now well below three hundred feet total depth.
One hundred fifty feet into the shaft.
Then it opens.
You emerge into a massive chamber.
The scale is staggering - easily two hundred feet across, the ceiling lost in 
darkness above. The bioluminescence here is different, deliberately cultivated. 
Glowing fungi and algae have been arranged in patterns along the walls, 
providing dim but functional light.
And you can see the full scope of the operation.
Sahuagin everywhere. Not dozens. Hundreds. They're organized in 
military formations, grouped by function. Warriors drilling in formation. 
Priestesses conducting rituals over pools of that glowing mucus. Craftsmen 
assembling cursed items in organized workshops. This is a full military 
encampment, an army preparing for invasion.
But that's not what makes your breath catch.
At the far end of the chamber, the floor drops away into another opening - 
larger, darker, deeper still. And rising from that opening, visible in the dim 
light...
Tentacles.
Four of them, each easily twenty feet long, resting on the chamber floor like 
massive serpents. They're translucent, covered in that mucus, pulsing gently 
with bioluminescence from within.
The aboleth is here. Not in some deeper lair, not hidden away. It's right 
below this chamber, close enough that its tentacles rest in this space.
And as you watch, frozen in invisible horror, one of the sahuagin priestesses 
approaches those tentacles reverently. She kneels, places her webbed hands on 
the mucus-slicked surface.
Her body goes rigid. Her eyes glaze over. Her mouth opens and she begins 
speaking - but the voice isn't hers. It's layered, resonant, impossibly ancient:
"Twenty days remain. The conjunction approaches. My children 
multiply. The surface cities will fall. The binding weakens with each 
tide. Soon... soon I am free."
The priestess collapses. Another sahuagin drags her away - still alive, but the 
mental contact has clearly taxed her.
Khû'leth is awake. Conscious. Planning. And counting down to 
freedom.
What do you do?
I ask my inner voice...ANything else or do I need to get out of here?!
Dec 9
Your patron's voice slides into your mind, cold and calculating as always - but 
there's an edge of genuine concern you rarely hear:
"Leave. NOW. You absolute fool."
A pause, then more urgently:
"That creature is ANCIENT. It ruled civilizations when your species was 
learning to make fire. Every moment you remain near it risks detection - 
aboleths don't just see, they SENSE minds, thoughts, intentions. Your ring 
protects you from domination, not from PERCEPTION."
Another beat.
"You have what you need: It's awake, it's planning, it has an army, and it 
knows EXACTLY when it's breaking free. Twenty days. That's your timeline. 
That mucus in your pouch is worth more than you know - my kind have... 
history with the Deep Ones. Unpleasant history."
The voice turns sharper:
"You've pushed your luck far enough. You're invisible to eyes, not to a 
creature that can taste THOUGHTS in the water. If it focuses its attention 
this direction even for a moment, that ring won't save you from being 
noticed - just from being controlled. And being noticed by something that 
thinks in centuries while you're in its lair surrounded by hundreds of its 
thralls is NOT survival behavior."
A final warning:
"I have invested considerable effort in keeping you alive, Johannes. Don't 
waste it by lingering to admire the decor. LEAVE."
Your patron - who rarely shows concern for your wellbeing beyond 
his own investment - is genuinely alarmed.
What do you do?
I listen to the voice of reason and get my ass out of there as quickly as 
possible.
Dec 9
Johannes doesn't need to be told twice. He turns and moves - not panicked, 
but with urgent purpose - back toward the shaft entrance.
The sahuagin army continues their preparations, unaware of the invisible 
human gliding past their formations. You keep your movements smooth 
despite the adrenaline, remembering: sharks are drawn to erratic motion.
You reach the shaft, begin ascending against that inward current. Hand over 
hand on the carved holds, pulling yourself up through the darkness. One 
hundred feet. Fifty feet.
The entrance appears above - that rectangle of slightly-less-darkness framed 
by alien symbols.
You emerge from the central structure, passing between the two sentries who 
remain oblivious. Your invisibility potion still holds - plenty of time left.
Once you're clear of the immediate area, you risk a slightly faster pace across 
the open seafloor, putting distance between yourself and those tentacles, that 
ancient voice, that army preparing for conquest.
When you're a safe distance away - maybe a hundred fifty feet from the ruins - 
you pause, hanging in the water, letting your heart rate settle.
Message to Cyrus: "Coming up. It's worse than we thought. Aboleth is awake, 
active, has hundreds of sahuagin. Twenty days until it breaks free. We need 
to surface NOW and get this to the Admiral."
Immediate response: "Thank Mishakal. Coming up with you. Thessa's 
already starting ascent with the acolytes. We're at one-fifty, see you in a 
moment."
You begin your ascent, controlled and steady. No reason to rush now and risk 
the bends or drawing attention from below.
At one hundred fifty feet, you see them - Cyrus, Kessa, Thessa, and the two 
acolytes, all rising with you in a loose formation. Kessa's eyes scan the water 
around you even though she can't see you. She knows you're there.
One hundred feet. The water grows warmer, lighter.
Fifty feet. You can see the hull of the Stormbreaker above, dark against the 
surface light.
You break the surface near the ship's ladder. The moment your head clears the 
water, the potion's invisibility fades - you become visible again, gasping 
slightly despite the magical breathing.
Sailors reach down to help you aboard. Captain Andra is already there: 
"Commander? What did you find?"
Behind you, Cyrus and the others surface, the temple group climbing aboard 
with the efficient urgency of people who know they've just scouted something 
terrible.
The mission is complete. You're alive. And you have intelligence 
that changes everything.
What do you tell Captain Andra first?
I cover everything, but the awareness of the aboleth takes priority, along with 
the numbers of sanguin moving around.
Dec 9
Johannes hauls himself aboard, water streaming from his cloak. He doesn't 
bother with pleasantries:
"Captain, we need to return to Ak-Thyln immediately. The situation is 
critical."
Andra's expression sharpens. "Report."
"The aboleth is awake and fully conscious - not dormant, not barely aware. 
It's commanding an army." Johannes strips off his waterproof pouches, 
securing them. "Hundreds of sahuagin, Captain. Not dozens. Organized 
military formations, supply lines, workshops. This is a full invasion force 
preparing for deployment."
The crew within earshot goes very still.
"It knows exactly when the binding breaks," Johannes continues. "Twenty 
days. It's counting down. And it's not just preparing to escape - it's preparing 
to conquer. Systematic abduction of coastal residents, transformation into 
water-breathing thralls, mass production of enchanted items for mental 
control."
Cyrus climbs aboard, his face grim. "We found prisoners, Captain. At least 
eleven in one holding area, with evidence of thirty-two more processed 
through their system. They're building an army of converted surface dwellers."
Thessa surfaces next, her grey hair plastered to her skull. "The temple needs to 
know immediately. An aboleth of this age and power, with this level of 
preparation..." She doesn't finish, but her meaning is clear.
Captain Andra's jaw tightens. "How deep?"
"Central chamber is approximately three hundred fifty feet down," Johannes 
reports. "The aboleth itself is positioned below that - I saw its tentacles. Each 
one twenty feet long at least."
Andra turns to her first mate. "Full sail. Fastest course back to Ak-Thyln. And 
someone get Admiral Kethren's signal flags ready - he needs to know we're 
coming in with urgent intelligence."
She looks back at Johannes. "Anything else we need to know before we sail?"
Do you mention the mucus samples, the cave system details, the 
specific observations about thrall transformation? Or save the full 
debrief for the Admiral and temple leadership?
Everything. The sooner more brains can begin working on this, the better.
Dec 9
"Everything," Johannes says, moving to the ship's chart table as sailors 
scramble to set sail. "Captain, gather your officers. The Admiral and temple 
leadership need the complete picture, but your crew should hear this too - 
they'll be part of whatever response we mount."
Andra nods sharply, calling her first mate and navigator over. Cyrus, Kessa, 
and Thessa join the cluster around the table as the Stormbreaker surges into 
motion, sails filling with wind.
Johannes lays it out systematically, the way he'd brief resistance commanders:
"The central structure is the command center - ancient ruins, pre-Cataclysm 
or older. Two sentries at the entrance, but they're just ceremonial. The real 
security is deeper. I descended approximately 350 feet total depth to a massive 
chamber - easily 200 feet across. That's where the main force is staged."
He traces rough positions on the chart. "Conservative estimate: 300-400 
sahuagin. Warriors in formation drills, priestesses conducting rituals, 
craftsmen in workshops. This is a professional military operation with full 
logistics support."
"Northeast of the main structure, there's a cave system." He marks it. "That's 
where they're holding prisoners and conducting transformations. Eleven 
captives confirmed - fishermen, sailors, coastal villagers. But the tally marks 
outside suggest forty-three total processed through. The other thirty-two are 
either already transformed, dead, or held elsewhere."
Thessa leans forward. "The transformation process?"
"Pools of concentrated aboleth mucus," Johannes pulls out one of the vials, 
still glowing faintly green. "They immerse captives in it. I watched a woman in 
mid-transformation - her skin was becoming translucent, webbing forming 
between fingers and toes. She could breathe water but looked like she was 
suffocating in it simultaneously."
Cyrus grimaces. "The mucus makes them breathe water but only water. They'd 
drown in air."
"Exactly. Perfect thralls for an underwater empire." Johannes sets down two 
more vials. "I collected three samples. Thessa, the temple said aboleth mucus 
could be used against them - we need your scholars analyzing this 
immediately."
The priestess carefully takes the vials. "Aboleths are vulnerable to their own 
secretions in concentrated form. We'll need to determine the exact 
application, but this is invaluable."
"The workshops are producing cursed items en masse," Johannes continues. 
"Shells, coins, masks - the same items we found in the coastal nest. They're 
designed to mentally compel victims to walk into the ocean. That's how they're 
acquiring most of their prisoners - enchantment rather than direct raids."
Captain Andra's navigator speaks up: "The Silver Catch - the missing fishing 
vessel. Were they...?"
"Dead," Johannes confirms grimly. "Evidence suggested they were consumed. 
But their disappearance served multiple purposes - elimination of witnesses, 
food for the army, and their ship's cargo likely processed for materials."
"Supply lines," he marks the pathways on the chart. "Three spoke routes 
radiating from the central structure to smaller cave systems. Regular patrols, 
cached equipment at intervals. Some items are enchanted - I saw magical 
glows in sealed packages. They're not just staging an invasion, they're building 
infrastructure to sustain it."
Kessa adds quietly, "The discipline we saw... these aren't mindless monsters. 
Every sahuagin moved with purpose, followed commands, maintained 
formations. Something is coordinating them perfectly."
"The aboleth itself," Johannes confirms. "I saw a priestess make direct contact 
with one of its tentacles. It spoke through her - layered voice, ancient beyond 
measure. It said 'twenty days remain, the binding weakens with each tide, the 
surface cities will fall.'"
Silence on deck. Even the sailors working the rigging have gone quiet, 
listening.
Thessa's face is pale. "It spoke? It's that conscious, that... present?"
"Fully aware. Planning. Counting down." Johannes meets her eyes. "The 
tentacles I saw were just resting in the chamber - casual, like someone draping 
their arms over furniture. The main body is deeper still. This creature isn't 
straining against weakening bonds. It's waiting with absolute confidence for 
the moment it can simply... step free."
The first mate swears under his breath.
"Tactical assessment," Johannes continues, forcing professional calm. "We 
cannot assault that position with conventional forces. Three hundred fifty feet 
of depth, hundreds of defenders in prepared positions, fighting in an 
environment that favors them completely. Even with Water Breathing, our 
forces would be at catastrophic disadvantage."
"But we can't leave it unopposed," Andra says.
"No. Which means we need unconventional approaches." Johannes looks at 
Thessa. "The binding magic - can it be reinforced? Modified? We have twenty 
days before the conjunction."
"Possibly. The temple will need to research the original binding, determine 
what's feasible." She clutches the mucus vials. "These samples may be key. If 
we can weaponize the aboleth's own secretions..."
Cyrus speaks up: "The prisoners. Eleven people still alive in those cages. We 
can't leave them there for twenty days."
"Agreed," Johannes says. "But a rescue operation would alert Khû'leth to our 
knowledge of the situation. We'd lose any element of surprise for whatever 
final response we mount."
Kessa's expression hardens. "So we choose between eleven lives and 
potentially thousands if we tip our hand too early."
The brutal calculus of war. Johannes has made these decisions before, but 
they never get easier.
Captain Andra looks toward Ak-Thyln's distant coastline, now visible on the 
horizon. "Two hours until we make port. Admiral Kethren will want this brief 
within minutes of docking. The temple leadership immediately after. How do 
we prioritize the response?"
Johannes, what do you recommend as the immediate priorities 
once you reach Ak-Thyln? And do you mention the possibility of 
negotiation, or keep that option close for now?
Bring them both together; a council of war. Any response will have to be 
coordinated intricately. If you can call the temple officials to the Admiral's 
headquarters, that would be the most efficient.
Dec 9
"Bring them together," Johannes says decisively. "This isn't a naval problem or 
a temple problem - it's both, and the response needs to be coordinated from 
the start. Captain, can you send a runner ahead once we're in signal range? 
Request Admiral Kethren convene an emergency war council at naval 
headquarters. Temple leadership, military command, and anyone with 
expertise in ancient bindings or aberration combat."
Andra nods approvingly. "Smart. Keeps everyone working from the same 
intelligence, prevents contradictory responses." She turns to her first mate. 
"The moment we're close enough, signal flags: 'Emergency war council 
required. Existential threat confirmed. Request Admiral convene all relevant 
leadership immediately upon our arrival.'"
"Aye, Captain."
Thessa looks thoughtful. "The temple's Lorekeeper - Brother Aldric - he's the 
one who found the original binding records. He should be there. And High 
Priestess Salindra has authority to commit temple resources without lengthy 
deliberation."
"Military side," Cyrus adds, "we'll need someone who understands siege 
warfare and unconventional tactics. This isn't going to be solved with standard 
naval engagement."
Johannes nods. "And someone with magical expertise - war mages, if Ak-
Thyln has them. We're dealing with ancient enchantments, binding magic, and 
creatures that operate on principles most soldiers have never encountered."
Kessa's been quiet, thinking. "What about Haven? Laurana and the resistance 
have resources, expertise in fighting impossible odds. Should we bring them 
into this?"
"Eventually," Johannes says. "But first we need Ak-Thyln's assessment of their 
own capabilities and limitations. Then we can determine what additional 
support we need and from where."
The Stormbreaker cuts through the waves, the city growing larger on the 
horizon. Johannes can see the harbor now, the naval fortress rising on the 
headland.
Captain Andra studies him. "You'll be presenting this intelligence directly to 
the Admiral. You've commanded resistance operations, fought Dragon Armies. 
How would you frame this for maximum effectiveness?"
Johannes, how do you plan to present this? What's your opening to 
the war council? What's the key message you want them to grasp 
immediately?
Chronologically. Everything I did, in order, to avoid confusion or omissions. 
Then wait while those with more experience decide how to approach a conflict 
in an inaccessible battleground with an enemy far beyond my capacity to 
understand.
Dec 9
"Chronologically," Johannes says. "Facts first, in sequence. What I observed, 
when, and under what conditions. Let them draw conclusions from complete 
information rather than my interpretations."
He pulls out his waterproof journal, makes quick notes while the details are 
fresh. Times, positions, numbers, observations. The discipline of a military 
commander who knows that accurate reporting saves lives.
"The key is making sure they understand the timeline," he continues. "Twenty 
days isn't much, but it's not nothing. Enough time to research, prepare, maybe 
reinforce the binding if that's possible. But only if we start immediately."
Thessa nods approvingly. "Let the experts do what they're expert in. Your role 
is witness and scout - provide the data, then step back."
"Exactly." Johannes looks out at the approaching city. "I've fought Dragon 
Armies, led resistance operations, infiltrated fortresses. But an ancient aboleth 
planning an invasion from 350 feet underwater? That's beyond my experience. 
I'm not going to pretend otherwise."
Kessa gives him a slight smile. "Humility from Commander Constantinius. 
The world truly is ending."
Despite the tension, Johannes allows himself a brief smile back. "I know my 
limits. Recognizing when you're outmatched is how you stay alive long enough 
to find people who aren't outmatched."
The harbor grows closer. Signal flags begin going up from the Stormbreaker - 
urgent, priority, emergency council required.
Within minutes, responding flags appear from the naval fortress: Message 
received. Admiral assembling council. Dock at military pier. Immediate 
escort to headquarters.
"They're taking this seriously," Andra observes with satisfaction. "Good. They 
should be."
The ship glides into harbor, sailors expertly bringing her alongside the military 
pier. Before the gangplank is even secured, a naval officer is there - a 
commander by his insignia.
"Captain Andra? Admiral Kethren's compliments. He requests your party 
proceed immediately to headquarters. The war council is assembling now."
Johannes secures his pouches, checks that the mucus vials are safely with 
Thessa, and exchanges glances with Cyrus and Kessa.
"Ready?" Cyrus asks quietly.
"Ready," Johannes confirms.
 
NAVAL HEADQUARTERS - FIFTEEN MINUTES LATER
The war council chamber is impressive - a large room dominated by a detailed 
map table showing the entire coastal region. Admiral Kethren stands at its 
head, his weathered face grave. Around the table:
*	High Priestess Salindra - a woman in her sixties, wearing the silver 
and blue robes of Mishakal's temple, radiating calm authority
*	Brother Aldric - the Lorekeeper, elderly and scholarly, already 
surrounded by open tomes
*	Commander Voss - naval tactical officer, young but sharp-eyed
*	War Mage Thalen - robed in deep purple, staff in hand, expression 
neutral
*	Captain Andra - representing the Stormbreaker and direct witness
*	Thessa - senior temple cleric who accompanied the mission
And space cleared for Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa.
Admiral Kethren doesn't waste time with pleasantries: "Commander 
Constantinius. Captain Andra's signals indicated existential threat confirmed. 
The council is assembled. Report."
The room goes silent. All eyes on Johannes.
He steps to the map table, places his hand on the coastal region, and begins:
"Six days ago, a fishing village was attacked by sahuagin using enchanted 
items to compel victims into the ocean..."
He walks them through everything. Chronologically. The beach 
battle. The cave assault. The maps showing three villages targeted. 
The ride to Ak-Thyln. The research into Khû'leth. The mission 
approval. The descent.
The ruins. The sentries. The war band. The supply caches. The cave 
system. The eleven prisoners. The transformation pools. The tally 
marks suggesting forty-three total captives.
The mucus samples - he gestures to Thessa, who places the three 
vials on the table.
The central structure. The descent into darkness. The massive 
chamber. The hundreds of sahuagin in organized military 
formations.
And finally: the tentacles. The priestess making contact. The voice 
speaking through her. Twenty days.
When he finishes, the silence is profound.
Brother Aldric speaks first, his voice shaking slightly: "It spoke? It's that 
conscious?"
"Fully aware," Johannes confirms. "Planning, commanding, counting down 
with absolute confidence."
War Mage Thalen leans forward, studying the mucus vials. "These samples... 
you collected them from an active transformation site?"
"Yes. One open vessel among several sealed ones. They appear to be storing it 
in quantity."
High Priestess Salindra's expression is grave. "Commander, you mentioned 
you observed the aboleth's tentacles directly. How close were you?"
"Perhaps one hundred feet, Your Holiness. I was invisible via magical potion, 
but..." Johannes hesitates, then continues honestly, "my patron advised me to 
leave immediately. He indicated that aboleths can sense minds even when 
they cannot dominate them, and that prolonged proximity risked detection 
regardless of invisibility."
Commander Voss marks positions on the map. "Three hundred fifty feet 
depth. Hundreds of defenders. Prepared positions in an environment 
completely hostile to surface forces." He looks up. "Admiral, with respect, this 
is not a battle we can win through conventional naval engagement."
"Agreed," Admiral Kethren says grimly. He looks at Brother Aldric. "The 
binding. Can it be reinforced?"
The Lorekeeper pages through his tomes. "I... possibly. The original binding 
required a coalition of mages, priests, and..." he pauses, "sacrifices. Significant 
sacrifices. The magic was powered by willing deaths - seven mages gave their 
lives to create the binding structure."
Horrified silence.
"That may not be necessary for reinforcement," Thessa interjects quickly. "If 
the binding still holds partially, we might be able to shore it up without... that 
level of cost. But we'd need time to research, and access to the binding site 
itself."
"Which is where?" Commander Voss asks.
"The ruins themselves," Brother Aldric says. "The binding is anchored to the 
structure where the aboleth was imprisoned. To reinforce it, we'd need to work 
on-site."
"Underwater," Cyrus says flatly. "Three hundred fifty feet down, surrounded 
by an army of sahuagin, with an awake and aware aboleth watching."
War Mage Thalen drums his fingers on the table. "The mucus samples may 
offer another approach. Aboleths are known to be vulnerable to concentrated 
forms of their own secretions - it disrupts their natural defenses. If we could 
weaponize this..."
High Priestess Salindra looks troubled. "Either approach - reinforcing the 
binding or developing weapons from the mucus - requires time we may not 
have. Twenty days is not much for research, preparation, and execution."
Admiral Kethren turns to Johannes. "Commander, you've led resistance 
operations against impossible odds. You infiltrated and held Pax Tharkas 
against a Dragon Army. What's your assessment? Can this be stopped?"
How does Johannes respond? Does he mention the possibility of 
negotiation now, or keep that option to himself for the moment 
while the experts assess military/magical options?
As you said, this is battle that would occur on an inaccessible field, with far too 
many unknown variables. But, in short, it must, at just about any cost. This 
aboleth has access to the memories and knowledge of countless millenia, and 
the ability to continue to send out forces with impunity while we would be 
forced to continually defend against them. It is unsustainable. Either we must 
abandon the entire coast, which is untenable, or we must find a way to destroy 
the creature and its minions in its lair. 
Which does present a possibility. While it might be possible to use the mucus 
against the creature, three doses seems a paltry sum and would immediately 
doom whoever delivered it to guaranteed destruction. I wouldn't take that off 
the table, but...
What if we were to find some device or spell, magical or otherwise, that could 
immolate the entirety of the aboleth's lair? It is a large space; but it is 
confined. And the water pressures at that depth would likely concentrate any 
destructive force we would unleash. Is anyone aware of spells or other means 
that would be effective for such a task?
Show more
Dec 9
The council members exchange glances, the weight of Johannes's assessment 
settling over the room.
Admiral Kethren nods grimly. "Abandoning the coast isn't an option. We'd 
lose dozens of settlements, critical trade routes, our entire maritime 
infrastructure. And as you say - the creature would simply expand from there, 
building strength while we retreated."
War Mage Thalen's eyes sharpen with interest at the immolation suggestion. 
"A confined space at extreme depth..." He begins pacing, thinking aloud. "The 
pressure would indeed amplify certain effects. Fire wouldn't work - water 
extinguishes it. But there are other principles..."
Brother Aldric looks up from his tomes. "Elemental magic. Not fire, but 
perhaps lightning? Electricity conducts through water exceptionally well. A 
sufficiently powerful discharge in that enclosed chamber..."
"Would kill everything in it," Commander Voss finishes. "Including any of our 
people attempting the delivery."
"Not necessarily," Thalen counters. "There are spells that can be triggered 
remotely, or set with delayed activation. Glyph of Warding, for instance, 
though the power required would be..." He trails off, calculating.
High Priestess Salindra leans forward. "What about divine 
intervention? Earthquake could collapse the entire structure. Bury them 
under tons of stone and pressure."
"Would that kill an aboleth?" Cyrus asks. "They're aberrations, not natural 
creatures. Can they be crushed?"
"Everything physical can be damaged by sufficient force," Thessa says. "The 
question is whether we can generate that force at depth, and whether it would 
destroy the binding as well - potentially freeing the creature even as we try to 
kill it."
Brother Aldric's finger stops on a page. "Here. Delayed Blast Fireball - it's not 
truly fire when it detonates, it's pure magical force and heat. At that depth, the 
pressure might actually contain the explosion rather than dissipate it, turning 
the chamber into a pressure cooker."
War Mage Thalen nods slowly. "Seventh-level spell. I can cast it. But the 
timing would be critical - set it, evacuate, let it detonate. And we'd need to be 
certain the aboleth was actually in the chamber when it went off."
"It's mobile," Johannes points out. "Those tentacles I saw could have been just 
the creature resting near the surface of its lair. It might retreat deeper if it 
sensed danger."
Captain Andra speaks up: "What about multiple devices? A coordinated 
strike? Hit the central chamber, the cave systems, the supply routes 
simultaneously. Give it nowhere to retreat."
"Resource intensive," Admiral Kethren observes. "We'd need multiple high-
level casters, precise coordination at depth, and a way to ensure simultaneous 
detonation across multiple locations."
Commander Voss marks the map. "And we'd still need to deal with the 
prisoners. Eleven confirmed captives, possibly more. If we collapse the caves 
or detonate explosives, they die with the sahuagin."
The moral calculus hangs in the air.
Johannes meets Cyrus's eyes across the table. His friend's expression is 
troubled - the healer in him recoiling from the idea of knowingly killing 
prisoners, even to save thousands.
High Priestess Salindra's voice is heavy: "We cannot sacrifice innocent lives 
without attempting rescue. The temple will not sanction a plan that writes off 
eleven souls as acceptable losses."
"Then we need a two-phase operation," Johannes says. "Rescue first, then 
destruction. Or..." he pauses, thinking, "we use the rescue as distraction. While 
the aboleth's forces respond to a prison break, we position our destructive 
measures."
War Mage Thalen nods approvingly. "Tactically sound. They'd focus defenses 
on containing the escape, potentially drawing forces away from critical 
positions."
Brother Aldric looks troubled. "But this still requires us to position magical 
attacks in multiple locations at 350 feet depth, in hostile territory, without 
detection. Even with distraction, that's..."
"Nearly impossible," Commander Voss finishes bluntly.
Admiral Kethren drums his fingers on the map table. "Let me ask a different 
question, Commander Constantinius. You mentioned your patron advised you 
to leave. Does your... connection to infernal powers provide any insight into 
dealing with aberrations? Devils and aboleths have been at odds for eons, 
haven't they?"
Johannes, how do you respond? Do you share what your patron 
said about having "history" with the Deep Ones? And do you bring 
up the possibility of negotiation now, or continue focusing on 
destructive options?
But the two actions would not necessarily be exclusive; two groups - one a 
raiding party to rescue as many prisoners as possible (creating the kind of 
diversion and focus that could help cloud the aboleth's attention to other 
matters, like the group seeking to place the charges that could kill it. The 
uproar creates the perfect distraction, since the aboleth wouldn't chase after 
the raiders, but remain and accelerate its plans for invasion, increasing the 
likelihood that important martial figures related to the plan would be present 
when the fireballs were detonated.
Dec 9
Johannes's words cut through the tactical discussion with sharp clarity. The 
council members pause, considering the elegant brutality of the two-pronged 
approach.
Admiral Kethren's expression shifts from grim to calculatingly interested. "A 
simultaneous operation. The rescue creates chaos, draws attention, forces 
defensive response... while a separate team positions the destructive charges."
"More than that," Commander Voss adds, leaning over the map. "If the 
aboleth perceives prisoners escaping, it would likely assume that's 
the entire operation. Rush to accelerate its invasion timeline, pull forces 
together for immediate action..."
"Concentrating targets," Captain Andra finishes. "Instead of forces spread 
across multiple cave systems, they'd consolidate in the central chamber for 
coordinated response."
War Mage Thalen nods slowly. "And an aboleth that ancient would be 
arrogant enough to believe it could simply crush a rescue attempt. It wouldn't 
flee deeper - it would move to command the response directly, ensuring the 
escaped prisoners are recaptured and made examples of."
"Which puts it exactly where we need it when the charges detonate," Johannes 
concludes.
High Priestess Salindra's expression is troubled but thoughtful. "This gives the 
prisoners a chance at survival while still addressing the existential threat. The 
temple could support this approach... but the rescue team would be taking 
catastrophic risk."
"They'd be diving into hostile territory, breaking prisoners out of a heavily 
guarded position, then escaping through 350 feet of water while under 
pursuit," Cyrus says quietly. "With an enraged aboleth behind them."
"Yes," Johannes says simply. "It's suicide odds. Which is why it needs to be 
volunteers who understand exactly what they're walking into."
Brother Aldric raises a hand hesitantly. "Timing would be critical. How long 
would the demolition team need to position their charges?"
War Mage Thalen considers. "Delayed Blast Fireball can be set with up to one 
minute delay - maximum. If we wanted longer, we'd need Glyph of Warding, 
which requires inscribing surfaces... that takes minutes per glyph, and would 
be immediately obvious to any guard patrol."
"So the demolition team needs to work fast," Commander Voss says. "Get in 
position, set charges, get out. All while the rescue is creating chaos."
"Multiple charges," Thalen continues. "Central chamber definitely - that's 
where the aboleth will be. But also the cave system where the prisoners are 
held. Collapse it after evacuation to eliminate that supply line. And ideally the 
other spoke tunnels - trap their forces in the central area."
Admiral Kethren marks positions. "So we need: One rescue team, probably 4-
6 people maximum for speed and stealth. One or more demolition teams - 
War Mage Thalen, who else can cast seventh-level spells?"
"I can prepare Earthquake," High Priestess Salindra says quietly. "Ninth level. 
It would collapse the entire structure if cast at the binding site itself. But..." 
she hesitates. "I would need to be there. To cast it. And the spell takes time to 
channel."
The weight of what she's offering settles over the room. The High Priestess 
herself, going to the aboleth's lair.
"Your Holiness, that's-" Thessa begins.
"Necessary," Salindra interrupts gently. "If we're committing to this plan, we 
commit fully. I can cast Water Breathing on myself and others. I can 
provide Protection from Evil against aberrations. And I can bring the 
structure down around Khû'leth's head." She meets Johannes's eyes. "You're 
right, Commander. This must be stopped at almost any cost. I'm willing to pay 
that cost."
Brother Aldric looks stricken but says nothing.
Commander Voss speaks carefully: "So the theoretical plan is: Rescue team 
infiltrates, breaks prisoners out, creates maximum chaos. Demolition team - 
War Mage Thalen positioning Delayed Blast Fireballs, High Priestess Salindra 
preparing Earthquake - sets charges while attention is focused on escape. 
Prisoners evacuate toward surface while demolition team follows. Charges 
detonate once all friendly forces are clear, collapsing the structure and 
hopefully killing the aboleth in concentrated magical destruction."
"Theoretical," Admiral Kethren emphasizes. "We haven't discussed the 
massive holes in this plan. Like how the demolition team positions charges 
without being detected. How the rescue team extracts eleven prisoners 
through 350 feet of water while under pursuit. How we coordinate timing 
without communication at that depth. How we ensure the aboleth doesn't 
simply... leave before detonation."
Johannes nods. "All valid concerns. But it's the first plan that addresses both 
moral necessity-saving the prisoners-and strategic necessity-eliminating 
the threat before it breaks free."
Thessa speaks up: "The mucus samples. We could use them as insurance. If 
the aboleth pursues the rescue team directly, someone could deploy 
concentrated mucus as a weapon. It wouldn't kill it, but it might disable or 
weaken it long enough for escape."
"A suicide weapon," Kessa says quietly from her position near the wall. She's 
been listening intently. "Whoever deploys it would need to get close enough to 
an aboleth to splash it with its own mucus. They'd be within tentacle range."
"Yes," Thessa acknowledges.
Captain Andra looks at Johannes. "Commander, you'd be part of the rescue 
team, wouldn't you? You've already scouted the location, know the layout, and 
have that immunity to mental domination."
Johannes, how do you respond? And do you mention the 
negotiation possibility now, as a potential alternative or 
supplement to this increasingly dangerous plan?
Wait. If we could collapse the building first, that would compress the space 
available even more, reducing the number of spells needs to create the 
explosion, One, maybe two, at most. Which significantly reduces the number 
of people involved. As long as we can guarantee that the aboleth is at the 
heart of the explosion, that eliminates the need to destroy the other cave 
systems, etc. Sahuguin aren't capable of creating a threat on their own. They 
don't have the capacity. The aboleth is the only concern. Kill it, and the threat 
is reduced to minimal.
Dec 9
Johannes's words stop the tactical planning cold. The council members look at 
each other as the elegant simplicity of the revised approach sinks in.
War Mage Thalen's eyes light up. "Collapse the structure first. Trap the 
aboleth in compressed space, then detonate concentrated magical force in an 
area perhaps a quarter the original size..."
"One Delayed Blast Fireball in a crushed, confined area at 350 feet of depth 
and pressure," Brother Aldric says slowly. "The force would have nowhere to 
dissipate. It would be... catastrophic."
"For everything in that space," Commander Voss adds. "Which would be the 
aboleth, its command structure, and most of its elite forces if they're 
consolidating for invasion response."
High Priestess Salindra nods thoughtfully. "Earthquake first to collapse the 
ruins and compress the chamber. Then Delayed Blast Fireball into the rubble. 
The aboleth would be crushed, disoriented, trapped - and then incinerated by 
magical force with nowhere to escape."
"And you're right about the sahuagin," Admiral Kethren says. "Without the 
aboleth's intelligence and coordination, they're just scattered raiders. 
Dangerous, but manageable. Not an existential threat. The creature is what 
we need to kill."
Captain Andra traces the revised operation on the map. "So: rescue team 
extracts prisoners, creates chaos. While attention is focused on that, High 
Priestess casts Earthquake to collapse the structure. War Mage Thalen 
sets Delayed Blast Fireball in the compressed rubble. Both teams evacuate. 
Fireball detonates, kills everything that survived the collapse."
"Simpler," Commander Voss agrees. "Fewer moving parts, fewer people at 
risk, higher concentration of force on target."
Cyrus speaks up: "But this makes timing even more critical. If we collapse the 
structure while the rescue team is still in the cave system extracting 
prisoners..."
"We kill our own people," Johannes finishes. "The rescue has to be fast. Get in, 
break them out, get clear of the collapse radius - all before 
the Earthquake triggers."
"How long does Earthquake take to cast?" Commander Voss asks.
"One action - six seconds," Salindra says. "But the effects last one minute. The 
ground would shake, structures would collapse progressively. Anyone still in 
the cave systems when I cast it would have perhaps thirty seconds to clear 
before being buried."
Thessa looks worried. "That's not much time. Eleven prisoners, some possibly 
drugged or transformed, being evacuated through underwater passages by a 
small team..."
"It's tight," Johannes acknowledges. "But possible if the team is fast and the 
prisoners can swim."
War Mage Thalen raises another concern: "The Earthquake will alert the 
aboleth immediately. It will know something catastrophic is happening. Will it 
flee deeper, or will it remain to protect its army and investment?"
"It will remain," Johannes says with certainty. "An aboleth that ancient, that 
close to freedom, with centuries of planning invested? It won't abandon 
everything and run. It will believe it can stop us, crush the resistance, make 
examples of whoever dared attack."
"Arrogance," Brother Aldric murmurs. "The fatal flaw of ancient powers."
Admiral Kethren leans on the map table. "So the critical bottleneck is the 
rescue timing. Everything else - the collapse, the fireball, the evacuation - can 
work. But only if we can extract those prisoners and get them clear in under a 
minute from when the Earthquake begins."
He looks at Johannes. "Is that even possible, Commander?"
Johannes, how do you assess this? And do you bring up negotiation 
now as a potential way to buy time, reduce variables, or even avoid 
the suicide mission entirely? Or do you keep that card close?
Actually, I have a different idea that might be even better. If designated 
landing spaces can be created aboard ship, what if we were to use Teleport 
spells to move all the prisoners directly from their cells to ships awaiting on 
the surface? Yes, it creates serious health risks shifting so drastically in terms 
of pressure, but that can be mitigated by healers standing by ready to 
intercede, but a single spell can transport 8 additional individuals along with 
the spell caster, and removes any risk of trying to fight our way out of the 
holding areas or leaving individuals behind. Blunt force raid the cells, empty 
them, and that begins the countdown for Earthquake, then Fireball. Two spell 
casters and all the prisoners would be immediately withdrawn from the table 
as possible risks.
Dec 9
The room goes absolutely silent. Every eye turns to Johannes.
War Mage Thalen sits up straight. "Teleport. Of course. Seven levels, up to 
eight creatures plus the caster..." His mind visibly races through the 
calculations. "Two casters could extract all eleven prisoners in two castings. 
Instantaneous removal from the cells to prepared landing zones on deck."
High Priestess Salindra's expression shifts from troubled to cautiously 
hopeful. "The pressure differential would be extreme - 350 feet of depth to 
surface in an instant. Dangerous, potentially fatal, but..."
"But treatable," Thessa interrupts, leaning forward. "Lesser Restoration for 
the mucus transformation, healing magic for pressure trauma, stabilization 
spells. If we have clerics standing by on deck with prepared spells, most 
should survive. Certainly better odds than fighting through an underwater 
escape while pursued."
Brother Aldric pages frantically through his tome. "The bends, nitrogen 
bubbles in the blood, ruptured organs from rapid decompression... yes, 
magical healing should address most of it. The transformed ones might 
actually fare better - their bodies are partially adapted to pressure already."
Commander Voss maps it out: "So two casters teleport into the holding cave. 
Grab prisoners. Teleport directly to prepared ship decks where healing teams 
wait. The entire extraction takes... what, thirty seconds? A minute?"
"Less," Thalen says. "If we prepare properly. First caster takes six prisoners, 
second takes five plus any guards we incapacitate. Two castings, perhaps forty 
seconds total including casting time and prisoner gathering."
Captain Andra looks at Admiral Kethren. "We'd need two ships positioned 
precisely at coordinates, decks cleared for arrival, healing teams in position. 
And the teleport casters would need to have seen the destination or have 
detailed descriptions."
"We have the Stormbreaker," Kethren says. "And we can position a second 
vessel. I'll assign the Wave Dancer - smaller, faster, experienced crew. Both 
ships can be on station within hours."
Cyrus is already thinking through the medical response: "We'd need at least 
four clerics per ship, multiple uses of Lesser Restoration prepared, healing 
potions distributed, stabilization protocols ready. The temple can provide 
that."
"This changes everything," Commander Voss says, excitement creeping into 
his voice. "The rescue becomes a surgical strike instead of a fighting retreat. 
The demolition team doesn't have to worry about coordinating with escaping 
prisoners. We control the exact moment the operation begins."
Johannes nods. "And the moment the prisoners vanish from their cells, the 
sahuagin will sound the alarm. Total chaos. The aboleth will assume a major 
assault is underway, consolidate forces in the central chamber to respond-"
"Exactly where we want it," Salindra finishes. "I cast Earthquake, collapse the 
structure around it. Thalen positions Delayed Blast Fireball in the 
compressed rubble. We evacuate while it's disoriented and trapped. Fireball 
detonates. Aboleth dies."
War Mage Thalen raises a hand. "I should mention - Teleport isn't perfectly 
accurate. There's a chance of mishap, especially teleporting to a location I've 
only seen described. We'd need someone who's actually been to the 
destination to guide the spell."
All eyes turn to Johannes.
"I've been in that cave," he says simply. "I can describe it in detail. Or..." he 
pauses, "I could be one of the teleport casters. I don't have the spell, but if 
someone could provide a scroll or teach it..."
"No time for teaching," Thalen says. "But scrolls are possible. The temple 
might have one, or we could scribe them. Though..." he looks troubled, "using 
a scroll for Teleport requires a high degree of magical skill. The caster needs to 
be at least capable of seventh-level magic themselves, or the scroll simply 
won't function."
High Priestess Salindra speaks carefully: "I can cast Teleport. And so can our 
senior war priest, Castellan Morrow. Between us, we could handle the 
extraction."
"Which means you'd be in two places at once," Commander Voss points out. 
"Extracting prisoners from the cave and positioning to cast Earthquake in the 
central chamber."
"Not if I do one, Castellan Morrow does the other," Salindra says. "I teleport 
in, grab prisoners, teleport them to ship, then proceed to the central chamber 
for Earthquake. Morrow handles the second group independently."
Brother Aldric looks worried. "Your Holiness, you'd be making 
two Teleport jumps under combat conditions, then casting Earthquake in a 
collapsing underwater ruin. The magical strain alone..."
"Is acceptable," Salindra says firmly. "This plan gives us our best chance to 
save the prisoners and kill the aboleth. I can handle the casting requirements."
Admiral Kethren studies the map. "So the revised plan: Two ships on station 
above the coordinates. High Priestess Salindra and Castellan Morrow teleport 
into the prisoner cave, extract all eleven prisoners in two castings back to the 
ships. Healing teams immediately stabilize them. The alarm goes up. Sahuagin 
forces consolidate. High Priestess proceeds to central chamber, 
casts Earthquake. War Mage Thalen positions Delayed Blast Fireball in the 
collapsed rubble. Both evacuate. Fireball detonates. Mission complete."
He looks around the table. "This is workable. Actually workable. What are we 
missing?"
Johannes, what concerns or refinements do you see? And now that 
the plan is more surgical and less suicidal, do you mention the 
negotiation option as a backup, or keep it to yourself?
This could simplify things. If I and one or two others were to go down 
physically, we could infiltrate the holding cells, giving us a source of live 
reconnaisance that could eliminate mishaps in the teleport/rescue operation, 
as well as guarantee how many prisoners could be rescued. If the guards could 
be eliminated quietly, it could even give us the chance to see if there are 
others that could be rescued elsewhere. Second, I will inflitrate the aboleth's 
lair itself and hide myself somewhere out of the way. Again, pinpoint accuracy 
for the teleport, as well as the means for insuring the target is exactly where 
we need it to be as the earthquake and fireball are initiated. If we can work out 
instantaneous telepathic communication, and some means of obfuscating my 
mental presence from the aboleth's awareness more than this ring?
Dec 9
The council members lean forward, the operational precision of Johannes's 
suggestion drawing immediate interest.
War Mage Thalen nods slowly. "Advanced reconnaissance eliminates the 
teleport mishap risk entirely. If you're physically present in both locations, you 
become the anchor points. Teleport to a creature you can see has almost zero 
chance of error."
"And real-time intelligence," Commander Voss adds. "You'd know exact 
prisoner count, guard positions, aboleth location, optimal timing..."
High Priestess Salindra looks thoughtful. "Communication is 
solvable. Sending allows twenty-five word messages across any distance. I 
could maintain contact with you, relay information to the strike team. The 
mental obfuscation is more complex."
Brother Aldric pages through his tomes rapidly. "The Ring of Mind Shielding 
protects against domination and mind-reading, but not detection. The aboleth 
wouldn't know your thoughts, but it might sense a thinking presence nearby, 
especially if you're close..."
"Nondetection," Thessa interrupts. "Third-level spell. Makes the target 
immune to divination magic and unable to be perceived through magical 
scrying. It's not perfect against an aboleth's innate abilities, but combined with 
the ring, it should mask your mental presence significantly."
"Duration is eight hours," Salindra confirms. "More than sufficient for the 
operation. I can cast it on you before you descend."
Admiral Kethren studies Johannes. "You're proposing to infiltrate the prisoner 
cave, eliminate guards quietly, verify prisoner count and condition, then 
proceed alone into the central chamber where the aboleth itself rests, position 
yourself as an observation post, and coordinate the entire strike through 
magical communication."
"Yes," Johannes says simply.
"That's..." Commander Voss trails off, searching for words.
"Insane," Kessa finishes from the wall. Her voice is tight. "Johannes, you'd be 
alone in that chamber. One hundred feet from a creature that could kill you in 
seconds if it noticed you."
"I'd be invisible and mentally shielded," Johannes counters. "And I've already 
been that close once. I know I can do it."
Cyrus speaks quietly: "And if something goes wrong? If the aboleth detects you 
anyway, if you're discovered, if the timing breaks down?"
"Then I use Dimension Door to escape," Johannes says. "500 feet teleport, 
enough to reach the surface or at least get clear of the immediate threat. I have 
the scroll prepared."
War Mage Thalen looks impressed despite himself. "It's actually tactically 
sound. The real-time intelligence would be invaluable. Knowing 
the exact moment the aboleth is positioned optimally, when its forces are 
maximally consolidated..."
"Who goes with him to the prisoner cave?" Captain Andra asks. "He 
mentioned one or two others."
Johannes looks at Cyrus and Kessa. They've been with him through everything 
- Pax Tharkas, the Dragon Army, the coastal attacks. He trusts them 
completely.
Cyrus meets his eyes and nods slowly. "I go. Lesser Restoration for the 
transformed prisoners, healing if things go wrong, Water Breathing support."
Kessa's jaw is tight, but she nods too. "Someone needs to watch your back 
while you're coordinating magic users. And I'm good at quiet kills."
High Priestess Salindra's expression is grave. "Commander Constantinius, I 
want to be clear about what you're proposing. You would be the lynchpin of 
the entire operation. If you're compromised, if communication fails, if the 
aboleth detects you... everything collapses. The prisoners die, the strike team 
is exposed, and the aboleth remains free to invade."
"I understand the stakes, Your Holiness."
"Do you?" She leans forward. "Because I need to know - absolutely - that you 
understand this plan puts you closer to an ancient aberration than any mortal 
should ever willingly go. Your immunity to mental domination won't save you 
from physical attack. One tentacle strike could kill you before you can escape."
"I know," Johannes says steadily. "But this plan gives us the best chance of 
success. Real-time intelligence, precise coordination, minimal friendly 
casualties, and maximum damage to the target. Those advantages are worth 
the risk."
Brother Aldric speaks hesitantly: "There is... one other 
consideration. Nondetection conceals you from magical detection. But 
aboleths don't just sense magically - they sense through water pressure, 
vibration, chemical signatures. If you move too much, if your presence 
disturbs the water flow significantly..."
"I'll be perfectly still," Johannes says. "I've done stealth operations before. I 
know how to be invisible."
War Mage Thalen drums his fingers on the table. "The communication 
protocol would need to be precise. Sending allows twenty-five words per 
message. We'd need coded signals: 'Prisoners secured' means begin approach. 
'Target positioned' means cast Earthquake. 'Clear' means detonate fireball. 
Simple, unambiguous."
"Agreed," Johannes says.
Admiral Kethren looks around the table. "Does anyone see a fatal flaw in this 
approach? Speak now."
Silence. Then Commander Voss says slowly: "It's high-risk, but every 
alternative is either impossible or costs more lives. This actually might work."
"Timeline?" the Admiral asks.
"We need to prepare the ships, position them on station, brief the teleport 
casters, prepare healing teams, and get the strike team equipped," 
Commander Voss calculates. "Minimum... eighteen hours. Ideally twenty-
four."
"The aboleth said twenty days," Johannes reminds them. "We have time to do 
this right."
High Priestess Salindra nods. "Then we proceed. I'll coordinate with Castellan 
Morrow on the teleport rescue. War Mage Thalen prepares Delayed Blast 
Fireball. Commander Constantinius, Brother Cyrus, and Miss Darrow prepare 
for infiltration. Admiral, your ships get into position."
She stands, and the others follow. "We reconvene in twelve hours for final 
briefing and equipment distribution. May Mishakal grant us wisdom, courage, 
and the strength to do what must be done."
The council begins to break up, members heading to their 
preparations. Johannes, do you have any final questions or 
concerns to raise? Or do you take this moment to speak with Cyrus 
and Kessa privately about what you're proposing?
This plan is absolutely insane, crazy dangerous, and sounds like a totally kick-
ass way to die if necessary. If not, I don't think I will ever have to buy a drink in 
any tavern in Anaslon again.
Dec 9
Kessa lets out a sharp bark of laughter as the three of them step away from the 
dispersing council. "Only you would plan an operation this suicidal and 
immediately start thinking about the bar stories afterward."
Cyrus shakes his head, but there's a faint smile on his lips. "Sitting invisible 
one hundred feet from an ancient aboleth while coordinating a magical 
assassination via telepathy. You're right - this is absolutely insane."
"Completely deranged," Kessa agrees. She checks her daggers, a nervous habit. 
"Which is why it might actually work. No one expects someone to 
be that reckless."
"It's not reckless," Johannes protests. "It's calculated risk with significant 
operational advantages."
"It's both," Cyrus says dryly. "You can be tactically brilliant and suicidally 
brave at the same time. You've demonstrated this repeatedly."
They find a quiet corner of the headquarters courtyard. The sun is setting over 
Ak-Thyln, casting long shadows. Eighteen hours until the operation begins.
Kessa's expression turns serious. "Johannes, I need you to be honest with us. 
Not Commander Constantinius giving a tactical assessment - you. Are you 
actually confident you can pull off the central chamber infiltration? Because if 
you have doubts..."
She doesn't finish, but the implication is clear: tell us now, while we can 
adjust the plan.
Cyrus adds quietly: "We've followed you through worse odds. Pax Tharkas, the 
Dragon Army, coastal raids against overwhelming numbers. You've earned our 
trust. But this..." He gestures vaguely toward the harbor, the dark water 
beyond. "This is different. You'd be alone down there. We can't help you if 
things go wrong."
Johannes looks between his two closest companions. Kessa, who's been with 
him since before he understood what the curse truly meant. Cyrus, who's 
saved his life more times than either of them can count.
They deserve honesty.
"I'm terrified," he admits. "That thing down there is older than civilization, 
more powerful than anything I've ever faced, and operates on principles I 
barely understand. My patron - a devil - told me to run. That should tell you 
something."
Kessa nods slowly. "But?"
"But I've already done it once. I infiltrated, observed, and escaped without 
detection. I know the layout, the positions, the rhythms of the place." 
Johannes's voice strengthens. "And this plan gives those eleven prisoners their 
best chance. Gives the coastal cities their best chance. Gives us our best 
chance."
"The free drinks are just a bonus," Cyrus says with gentle humor.
"Exactly," Johannes allows himself a small smile. "Though honestly, after this, 
I'm planning to drink enough that I forget what aboleth tentacles look like."
Kessa snorts. "Not likely. That image is burned into our brains forever." She 
sobers. "Alright. We're with you. Prison cave infiltration, quiet guard 
elimination, prisoner assessment. Then you go play bait for a cosmic horror 
while Cyrus and I help coordinate topside."
"Actually," Cyrus says thoughtfully, "I should stay underwater with you during 
the central chamber phase. Not close - maybe positioned at the shaft entrance, 
far enough to be safe but close enough to provide emergency healing if you 
need to escape wounded."
"That's-" Johannes begins.
"Non-negotiable," Cyrus interrupts firmly. "You're taking insane risks for good 
tactical reasons. Let me take a smaller risk for good medical reasons. You 
might need healing to survive the escape, and every second counts at that 
depth."
Johannes looks at his friend - the cleric who's followed him into darkness 
repeatedly, who's pulled him back from death's edge, who's never wavered 
despite knowing about the curse.
"Alright," he agrees quietly. "Thank you."
"That's what friends do," Cyrus says simply.
Kessa clears her throat. "So. We have eighteen hours. I suggest we spend the 
first six sleeping, because we're all exhausted and operating on adrenaline. 
Then equipment check, final briefing, and..." She pauses. "Maybe a decent 
meal. If we're doing this, we do it properly rested and well-fed."
"Practical as always," Johannes says.
"Someone has to be, since you two keep volunteering for suicide missions." 
But her tone is affectionate.
They stand there for a moment, the three of them, watching the sun set over 
the ocean that hides an ancient horror. Tomorrow they'll descend into those 
depths again. Tomorrow they'll attempt something that by all rights should be 
impossible.
But tonight, they're alive, together, and committed to seeing this through.
"For what it's worth," Johannes says quietly, "if I do have to buy drinks for the 
rest of my life, I'm glad you two will be there to help me bankrupt myself."
Kessa grins. "Damn right we will."
Cyrus just smiles and claps Johannes on the shoulder. "Come on. Let's find 
those temple quarters and get some actual rest. Tomorrow we kill an aboleth."
"Tomorrow we kill an aboleth," Johannes agrees.
 
Eighteen hours until operation begins. What does Johannes do 
during this preparation time? Sleep, equipment check, any 
conversations he needs to have, messages to send? Or do we skip 
ahead to the final briefing and mission start?
Skip ahead. (Out of character - holy crap, this is awesome!!!)
Dec 9
(Out of character - RIGHT?! This is the kind of high-stakes tactical planning 
that makes D&D incredible. Johannes coordinating a surgical strike against 
an ancient cosmic horror while sitting invisible 100 feet away from it is 
PEAK drama. Let's do this!)
 
FINAL BRIEFING - 18 HOURS LATER
The pre-dawn darkness hangs over Ak-Thyln harbor. Two ships bob at anchor 
- the Stormbreaker and Wave Dancer, both stripped down and positioned 
precisely over the coordinates. Healing teams stand ready on both decks, 
clerics in Mishakal's colors preparing spells and arranging medical supplies.
In the Admiral's headquarters, the strike team assembles for final briefing:
Johannes - infiltration specialist, forward observer, tactical 
coordinator Cyrus - combat medic, positioned at shaft entrance as emergency 
support Kessa - staying topside to coordinate surface operations and prisoner 
stabilization High Priestess Salindra - teleport 
rescue, Earthquake caster Castellan Morrow - tall, scarred war priest, 
teleport rescue second team War Mage Thalen - Delayed Blast 
Fireball placement Thessa - support caster, Nondetection and protective 
spells
Admiral Kethren spreads the final operational map on the table.
"Final positions confirmed. Stormbreaker holds station here, Wave 
Dancer two hundred yards east. Both have healing teams ready - four clerics 
each, multiple Lesser Restoration spells prepared, healing potions distributed, 
stabilization protocols briefed."
He points to the underwater map. "Strike sequence:
Phase One - Infiltration: Commander Constantinius, Brother Cyrus, and 
Miss Darrow descend via Water Breathing. Kessa splits off at 175 feet, returns 
to surface. Johannes and Cyrus proceed to prisoner cave. Eliminate guards 
quietly. Verify prisoner count and condition. Johannes sends confirmation 
via Sending to High Priestess Salindra."
War Mage Thalen continues: "Phase Two - Rescue: High Priestess Salindra 
and Castellan Morrow teleport directly to Johannes's position in the cave. 
Each caster takes approximately half the prisoners - Salindra takes six, 
Morrow takes five. Teleport directly to prepared landing zones on ship decks. 
Healing teams immediately stabilize. Duration: under sixty seconds from first 
teleport to last prisoner evacuated."
High Priestess Salindra picks up: "Phase Three - Positioning: Once 
prisoners are secure, I teleport back underwater to the central structure 
entrance. Johannes has already proceeded to observation position inside the 
main chamber. He confirms aboleth location and force concentration 
via Sending. When optimal moment arrives, he signals: 'Target positioned.'"
"Phase Four - Collapse," Thalen says grimly. "High Priestess 
casts Earthquake. Structure begins collapsing immediately. Johannes 
confirms aboleth trapped in rubble. Cyrus extracts Johannes if needed - 
they're both carrying Dimension Door scrolls as backup. High Priestess exits 
via teleport to ship."
"Phase Five - Detonation," he continues. "I descend to collapsed structure, 
position Delayed Blast Fireball in the rubble where aboleth is trapped. Set one 
minute delay. Exit via my own Dimension Door. Fireball detonates. 
Everything in that compressed space dies."
Commander Voss marks final escape routes. "All personnel back on ships 
within three minutes of Earthquake casting. Ships immediately make distance 
from the site in case of secondary collapses or surviving hostiles."
Admiral Kethren looks at each team member in turn. "Timing is everything. 
Communication is everything. If any phase fails, we abort and reassess. 
Clear?"
Nods around the table.
Thessa steps forward with a small collection of items. "Magical preparations. 
Commander Constantinius - Nondetection first, then Water Breathing." She 
begins casting, the magic settling over Johannes like a cool mist. "You're now 
shielded from magical detection for eight hours. Combined with your ring, the 
aboleth shouldn't sense your mental presence."
She hands him a small crystal. "Sending Stone - already paired to High 
Priestess Salindra's. For critical communications only, as the aboleth might 
sense repeated magic use."
High Priestess Salindra adds: "I have Sending prepared multiple times. You 
can contact me, I can contact you. Twenty-five words per message. Use them 
wisely."
War Mage Thalen distributes scrolls. "Dimension Door for emergency 
extraction. Johannes gets two - one for himself, one backup. Cyrus gets one. 
High Priestess has it prepared as spell. Don't hesitate to use them if things go 
wrong."
Brother Aldric brings forward three vials - the remaining mucus samples. "We 
analyzed these. The mucus is indeed toxic to aboleths in concentrated form, 
but deployment requires direct contact. These are backup weapons of last 
resort. If you must use them, throw at tentacles or body - avoid splashing 
yourself, as the transformation effect is permanent without Greater 
Restoration."
Kessa takes one vial, secures it carefully. Cyrus takes another. Johannes takes 
the third.
Castellan Morrow speaks for the first time - his voice is deep, calm. "I've 
cast Teleport in combat dozens of times. I won't fail the extraction. But I need 
Commander Constantinius to be absolutely still when we arrive. Don't move, 
don't react, just let us grab prisoners and go. Understood?"
"Understood," Johannes confirms.
Captain Andra checks her timepiece. "Twenty minutes until optimal tide 
conditions. Dawn breaks in forty minutes - we want to be finished before full 
light reveals our ships to any surface observers."
She looks at Johannes, Cyrus, and the spell casters. "This is the most 
audacious military operation I've witnessed in thirty years of naval service. If 
you succeed, you'll have saved thousands of lives and prevented a catastrophe. 
If you fail..." She doesn't finish.
"We won't fail," Johannes says quietly.
High Priestess Salindra places her hand on his shoulder. "Mishakal's light 
guide you through the darkness, Commander. May your courage hold, your 
mind stay clear, and your path lead back to us."
"And may Paladine grant us swift justice," Castellan Morrow adds.
War Mage Thalen just nods grimly. "Let's kill this thing."
Admiral Kethren straightens. "Strike team, to your vessels. Operation begins 
in twenty minutes. Dismissed."
 
ABOARD THE STORMBREAKER - 15 MINUTES LATER
The deck is organized chaos - healing teams in position, equipment staged, 
sailors maintaining position against current. Johannes stands at the rail in full 
gear:
*	Trident of Warning (advantage on initiative, party can't be surprised)
*	Cloak of Manta Ray (swim speed, water breathing backup)
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (mental immunity)
*	Amulet of Health (CON 19, 66 HP)
*	Two Dimension Door scrolls (emergency escape)
*	Mucus vial (weapon of last resort)
*	Sending Stone paired to Salindra
*	Waterproof signal flare
*	Nondetection active (8 hours)
Cyrus stands beside him, similarly equipped but with additional healing 
supplies. His studded leather looks almost fragile compared to his usual chain 
mail, but he moves easier, lighter.
Kessa approaches, checks Johannes's gear one final time. "Everything secure. 
Communications clear. Backup plans in place." She meets his eyes. "You're 
ready."
"I'm ready," he agrees.
She pulls him into a brief, fierce hug. "Come back alive, Johannes. That's an 
order."
"Yes ma'am," he says softly.
Cyrus offers his hand. Johannes takes it, and they clasp forearms - the old 
military way, the way that says brothers in arms.
"Together," Cyrus says simply.
"Together," Johannes agrees.
Captain Andra calls from the helm: "Strike team, positions! Operation begins 
in five minutes!"
Johannes and Cyrus move to the rope ladder. The water below is black, 
impenetrable, hiding an ancient horror and an army of thralls.
High Priestess Salindra appears at the rail. "Commander. One final thing." She 
presses something small into his palm - a silver coin stamped with Mishakal's 
symbol. "Not for luck. For proof. When you return, show me this coin, and I'll 
know it's truly you and not some thrall wearing your face."
The weight of what she's saying settles over him. The aboleth could capture 
him, transform him, send him back as a spy.
"I'll return it personally," Johannes promises, securing the coin.
"I know you will." She steps back. "May your gods - all of them - watch over 
you."
The ship's bell rings. Once. Twice. Three times.
It's time.
Johannes descends the ladder into the dark water. Cyrus follows immediately 
behind.
The ocean closes over your head. The magical breathing engages. You begin to 
descend into the depths.
Above, Kessa watches until you disappear, her hand tight on the rail.
 
What are Johannes's thoughts as he descends? And are you ready 
to begin Phase One?
Before that, a change to the plan. Trying to do both the prisoner rescue and 
the aboleth lair is to much for one person. Someone else needs to do the 
prisoner rescue.
Dec 9
Johannes surfaces suddenly, startling the crew. He pulls himself back up the 
ladder with urgent purpose.
"Wait. Stop. The plan needs adjustment."
Captain Andra turns sharply. "Commander?"
"I can't do both," Johannes says, water streaming from his gear. "The prisoner 
cave reconnaissance and the central chamber observation. They're in opposite 
directions, and the timing's too tight. If I'm in the prisoner cave when the 
rescue teleports happen, I can't be in position to observe the aboleth. We need 
someone else to handle one or the other."
Admiral Kethren, still on deck for the launch, frowns. "You're the only one 
who's scouted both locations."
"I can describe the prisoner cave in detail to someone else," Johannes 
counters. "It's simpler - one chamber, cages along the wall, guards in 
predictable positions. The central structure is the complex infiltration. That's 
where I need to be."
High Priestess Salindra nods slowly. "He's right. We were asking one person to 
be in two places at critical moments. Commander, what do you propose?"
Johannes, who handles the prisoner cave reconnaissance? Options 
might include:
*	Cyrus goes alone to the cave (he has healing for transformed prisoners, 
combat capability)
*	Kessa goes with Cyrus to the cave (her stealth skills for guard 
elimination)
*	Someone else from the strike team takes the cave mission
*	A different approach entirely
What's your recommendation?
Kessa, if she's willing
Dec 9
Johannes looks directly at Kessa. "Keys. I need you to take the prisoner cave."
She blinks, surprised. "I was coordinating topside-"
"I know. But you're the better choice for this." Johannes speaks quickly, the 
tactical logic clear in his mind. "The cave is straightforward infiltration - 
guards, prisoners, simple layout. You've done a hundred jobs like this. Stealth 
approach, quiet kills if needed, assess prisoner condition, be the teleport 
anchor point when Salindra and Morrow arrive."
Kessa's expression shifts from surprise to consideration. "And you focus 
entirely on the aboleth chamber. The complex part."
"Exactly. I've already been inside the central structure - I know the descent, 
the layout, the hiding positions. That's where the real danger is, where we 
need eyes on target." He turns to the others. "Kessa infiltrates the prisoner 
cave, eliminates the two guards quietly, verifies prisoner count. When she 
signals ready, Salindra and Morrow teleport in, grab prisoners, teleport out. 
Sixty seconds, maybe less."
Cyrus nods slowly. "That leaves me free to position at the shaft entrance as 
planned - emergency support for Johannes without splitting focus."
High Priestess Salindra looks at Kessa. "Miss Darrow, you'd be the anchor 
point for two Teleport spells in hostile territory. Are you comfortable with that 
responsibility?"
Kessa's jaw sets with determination. "I've broken people out of Dragon Army 
prisons. I can handle two sahuagin guards and some cages." She looks at 
Johannes. "You trust me with this?"
"Completely," he says without hesitation. "You're one of the best infiltrators I 
know. And you're the only person here I'd trust to pull this off solo while I'm 
busy elsewhere."
She studies him for a moment, then nods sharply. "Alright. I take the prisoner 
cave. You take the nightmare chamber with the cosmic horror." A slight smile. 
"Somehow I think you got the worse end of this deal."
"Debatable," Johannes says dryly.
Admiral Kethren looks around. "Does this resolve the operational concern? 
One person, one objective each?"
"It does," Commander Voss confirms. "Cleaner division of responsibilities. 
Kessa scouts and secures cave, Johannes scouts and observes central chamber. 
Both provide teleport anchor points for their respective phases."
War Mage Thalen nods. "I like it better actually. Less chance of timing 
conflicts or positioning problems."
Thessa steps forward. "Miss Darrow, you'll need the same 
protections. Nondetection, Water Breathing, and I'll give you Protection from 
Evil and Good - advantage against aberrations, including sahuagin."
"Appreciated," Kessa says, moving to where Thessa can cast the spells.
While the magic settles over her, Captain Andra hands Kessa a waterproof 
pouch. "Communication stone paired to ship. Signal flares. Extra daggers - 
you said your crossbow's useless underwater."
"Javelins and harpoon," Kessa corrects, checking the weapons. "Already killed 
sahuagin with them before."
Johannes briefs her quickly: "Cave entrance is northeast of the central 
structure, about two hundred yards. Tally marks outside - ignore them. 
Descend the tunnel, opens into a chamber forty feet across. Six cages along the 
far wall, eleven prisoners last count. Two guards, usually positioned near the 
cages. There's a transformation pool in the center with glowing mucus-"
"Stay away from the pool, got it," Kessa interrupts. "What about the workshop 
area? The cursed items you mentioned?"
"Stone table on the left as you enter. Three sealed clay pots of mucus - that's 
where I collected samples. Don't disturb them unless necessary."
"Understood." She secures her gear, tests her movement. "Guards - quick kills 
or subdued?"
"Your call. Dead guards can't raise alarms, but noise from combat might. Use 
your judgment."
Kessa nods. She's done this calculus before.
High Priestess Salindra approaches. "Miss Darrow, when you're ready for 
extraction, use the Sending Stone. Just say 'Prisoners secured.' Castellan 
Morrow and I will teleport immediately to your position. Stay visible, stay still, 
let us do the grabbing."
"How will you know which prisoners to grab?" Kessa asks.
"We'll take whoever's closest, prioritize those who can't move themselves," 
Morrow's deep voice answers. "If there are more than eleven, we do a third 
trip. If fewer, we adjust on the fly."
"Simple enough." Kessa looks at Johannes one more time. "You be careful 
down there with that thing."
"You too. Those guards might be elite."
"Please. I've killed worse before breakfast." But her bravado doesn't quite hide 
the concern in her eyes.
Cyrus clasps her shoulder. "Mishakal watch over you, Keys."
"And you, Brother."
Captain Andra checks her timepiece. "We're now twelve minutes behind 
schedule, but still within acceptable window. Strike team - final positions!"
Johannes and Kessa move to the rope ladder together. Cyrus joins them.
"Together," Cyrus says quietly.
"Together," Johannes and Kessa echo.
They descend into the black water.
 
DESCENT - 100 FEET DOWN
The three of you sink through the darkness in tight formation. The magical 
breathing is steady, the water cold but bearable. At 175 feet, Kessa will split off 
toward the prisoner cave. You and Cyrus continue to 350 feet - you to infiltrate 
the central chamber, Cyrus to hold position at the shaft entrance.
As you descend, Johannes, what's going through your mind? Any final checks, 
thoughts, or preparations before you split up?
Nope. I'm trying to avoid any emotions that might increase my footprint.
Dec 9
Smart. Johannes's mind goes quiet, controlled. Military discipline taking over 
- the kind of cold focus that's kept him alive through impossible situations. No 
fear, no anticipation, no doubt. Just the mission. Just the descent.
175 feet.
Kessa breaks formation smoothly, angling northeast toward the prisoner cave. 
She gives a brief hand signal - good hunting - then disappears into the blue-
black gloom.
You and Cyrus continue down. The pressure increases. The cold deepens. The 
surface is a distant memory now.
250 feet.
The ruins begin to resolve below - broken columns, worked stone, that 
unnatural architecture. You can see the two sentries at the central entrance, 
motionless in their alcoves. They haven't noticed you yet - you're descending 
slowly, smoothly, just another piece of drifting shadow.
300 feet.
Cyrus taps your shoulder - the signal. He's peeling off here, positioning 
himself near the shaft entrance but out of direct line of sight. Close enough to 
help if you need emergency extraction, far enough to avoid detection.
You continue alone.
350 feet.
The central structure looms before you. The sentries remain oblivious. The 
water current pulls steadily inward - that same draw you felt before, the 
aboleth's lair breathing.
Your Nondetection is active. Your Ring of Mind Shielding protects your 
thoughts. Your invisibility potion is ready but not yet consumed - you're 
saving it for when you enter the structure itself.
You drift down to the seafloor, landing softly in the silt behind a tumbled 
column. The sentries are maybe fifty feet away. The entrance - that darkness 
that's more than darkness - beckons.
Above and behind you, Cyrus has taken position. Somewhere to the northeast, 
Kessa is approaching the prisoner cave.
It's time to infiltrate the aboleth's lair.
Do you drink the invisibility potion now before approaching the entrance, or 
save it for once you're inside the shaft?
How long does it's effects last?
Dec 9
The Potion of Invisibility lasts for 1 hour.
Given the operation timeline:
*	You need to infiltrate the central chamber
*	Position yourself for observation
*	Wait for Kessa to signal prisoner extraction (could be 10-20 minutes)
*	Observe the aboleth's response and force consolidation
*	Confirm optimal moment for Earthquake
*	Coordinate final strike phases
You're probably looking at 30-45 minutes total from entry to extraction. The 
potion should cover the entire operation with time to spare, but drinking 
it now means you're invisible for the approach past the sentries and the entire 
descent into the chamber.
Alternatively, you could try to slip past the sentries without it (they didn't 
notice you last time when you were just being careful), saving the potion for 
inside the main chamber where the real danger is. But that's riskier.
What do you do?
Oh, I drink it now
Dec 9
Johannes uncorks the Potion of Invisibility and drinks it down in one smooth 
motion. The liquid is cold, tasting of starlight and shadow.
The magic takes hold immediately. You look down - nothing. Your hands, your 
body, your equipment - all invisible. Even the disturbance you make in the 
water seems muted, harder to detect.
You are completely invisible for the next hour.
You move from behind the column, drifting across the open seafloor toward 
the central entrance. The two sentries stand motionless in their alcoves, those 
dead black eyes scanning the darkness. You pass within twenty feet of the left 
sentry.
He doesn't react. Doesn't twitch. You're a ghost in the water.
The entrance looms before you - that darkness that seems to swallow light. 
The current pulls stronger here, drawing you inward. You let it help, moving 
with the flow rather than against it, smooth and silent.
You cross the threshold.
The carved symbols on the walls seem to writhe in your peripheral vision, 
alien script that your mind wants to slide away from. You ignore them, 
focusing on the descent.
The shaft drops away steeply. Hand over hand on the carved holds, controlling 
your descent against the inward current. The pressure increases. The darkness 
deepens.
100 feet down the shaft. 450 feet total depth.
150 feet down. 500 feet total.
The massive chamber opens below you. You emerge from the shaft into that 
vast space, and your breath would catch if you weren't maintaining perfect 
control.
The sahuagin army spreads before you.
Hundreds of them, organized in military formations. Warriors drilling. 
Priestesses conducting rituals. Craftsmen at their workshops. But there 
are more than last time - reinforcements have arrived, or forces have 
consolidated. You count quickly: 400+, easily.
And at the far end of the chamber, where the floor drops away into deeper 
darkness...
The tentacles.
Four massive appendages, each twenty feet long, resting on the chamber floor. 
Translucent, covered in mucus, pulsing with bioluminescent patterns from 
within. They're positioned differently than before - spread wider, as if the 
creature below is... awake. Alert.
You need to find a hiding position. Somewhere with good sightlines to observe 
the aboleth and the sahuagin forces, but out of the way, unlikely to be 
disturbed.
Roll Perception to find an optimal observation post.
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Perception with advantage (Trident of Warning) for you.
First roll: 3 + 5 = 8 Second roll: 16 + 5 = 21
Result: 21 - Excellent!
 
Your eyes sweep the massive chamber systematically, looking for the perfect 
vantage point. The sahuagin activity provides cover - so much movement that 
stillness becomes invisible.
You spot it.
High on the chamber wall, perhaps forty feet up from the floor, there's 
a collapsed section of ancient stonework - what might have once been a 
viewing gallery or ceremonial platform. The ruins create a shadowed alcove 
with a clear view down to where the tentacles rest, but it's elevated enough 
that casual patrols wouldn't pass by. The stone is stable enough to support 
your weight, and there are handholds for positioning.
Better still: the alcove is positioned at an angle where the bioluminescent light 
creates natural shadow - even if your invisibility were to fade, the darkness 
would help conceal you.
You drift upward smoothly, using the chamber's natural water currents to help 
position yourself. The sahuagin below continue their activities, none looking 
up. Why would they? This is their domain, their fortress. They have no reason 
to suspect infiltration.
You settle into the alcove, wedging yourself against the ancient stone. From 
here you can see:
*	The tentacles clearly - about 80-90 feet away, close enough to 
observe but far enough for relative safety
*	The main sahuagin formations - warriors, priestesses, command 
structure
*	The shaft entrance where you came in - your primary escape route
*	The deeper opening where the aboleth's main body rests below
You test the position. Stable. Concealed. Perfect sightlines. This will work.
Now comes the hard part: waiting.
You check your mental countdown. The invisibility potion has about 55 
minutes left. Somewhere northeast of here, Kessa is approaching the prisoner 
cave.
Do you send a Sending to High Priestess Salindra now to confirm 
you're in position? Or wait until Kessa signals that the prisoners 
are secured before making contact?
Send confirmation
Dec 9
You focus your mind on the Sending Stone, feeling the paired connection to 
High Priestess Salindra. Twenty-five words maximum.
"In position, central chamber. Invisible, concealed, 90 feet from target. 400+ 
sahuagin present, forces consolidated. Tentacles visible, creature alert. 
Awaiting prisoner extraction signal. Standing by."
A brief pause - maybe ten seconds - then Salindra's voice echoes in your mind, 
calm and clear:
"Confirmed. Excellent work, Commander. Castellan Morrow and I are 
prepared. Ships ready. Healing teams standing by. Will await Miss 
Darrow's signal. Mishakal guide you both. Hold position."
The connection fades.
You settle deeper into the alcove, making yourself as small and still as 
possible. From your vantage point, you watch the organized chaos below:
A priestess approaches the tentacles, kneels reverently. Her body goes rigid 
as she makes contact. When she speaks, that layered voice emerges - the 
aboleth speaking through her:
"The binding weakens. Nineteen days remain. Soon the surface 
dwells will kneel. Soon they will SERVE."
She collapses. Guards drag her away.
The warriors continue their drills - organized, disciplined, deadly. These aren't 
mindless thralls. These are trained soldiers awaiting deployment orders.
Time passes. 5 minutes. 10 minutes.
Your body remains perfectly still. Your breathing steady. The ancient stone 
cold against your back. Every few minutes, another priestess makes contact 
with the tentacles, receives commands, collapses.
The aboleth is very active. Very aware. Planning, coordinating, preparing.
15 minutes.
Then, faintly, through the Sending Stone, you feel a pulse. Not words yet - just 
the connection activating from the other end.
Kessa must be signaling.
A moment later, Salindra's voice in your mind, though not directed at you - 
she's relaying to the strike team:
"Prisoner signal received. Beginning extraction. Commander Constantinius, 
observe and report aboleth response."
This is it. The operation is going live.
What do you do? Keep watching the tentacles? Scan the sahuagin 
forces for reaction? Prepare to track how quickly the alarm 
spreads?
Nothing. No disturbance
Dec 9
Johannes remains absolutely motionless. A statue in the alcove. Not even 
his eyes move rapidly - just slow, controlled observation sweeps. No ripples in 
the water. No change in breathing pattern. No mental activity beyond passive 
observation.
Still. Silent. Invisible.
Below, the sahuagin continue their routines. Warriors drill. Priestesses 
conduct rituals. Craftsmen work. The tentacles pulse gently with 
bioluminescence.
30 seconds pass.
Nothing changes. The chamber is unaware that two high-level clerics just 
teleported into their prison cave, grabbed eleven captives, and vanished.
60 seconds.
Still nothing. The extraction must have been clean - in, grab, out. No alarms 
triggered yet.
90 seconds.
Then - a disturbance at one of the spoke-tunnel entrances. A sahuagin 
guard bursts into the chamber, swimming frantically. He's making clicking 
sounds - urgent, alarmed.
The warrior formations pause their drills. Priestesses turn their attention.
The guard reaches a cluster of what appear to be commanders - larger 
sahuagin with more elaborate armor. Rapid clicking exchanges. Body language 
showing agitation, confusion.
The alarm has been raised. The prisoners are gone.
The commanders respond immediately. Sharp clicks that echo through the 
water. Warriors begin forming up into organized squads. Not panicked -
 disciplined. This is a military force responding to a crisis.
And then...
The tentacles move.
Not violently. Not suddenly. But with terrible, deliberate purpose. They lift 
from the chamber floor, rising, spreading wider. The bioluminescence within 
them intensifies - green-blue light pulsing stronger.
Johannes, your instincts scream danger even though you haven't moved, 
haven't been detected. This is a creature that has existed for millennia waking 
to full alertness.
Do you remain perfectly still, or do you send immediate intel to 
Salindra about the aboleth's response?
No nothing. No disturbance
Dec 9
Johannes doesn't even twitch. The discipline is absolute. Stone. Shadow. 
Nothing.
Below, the tentacles continue rising, spreading. The light within them pulses 
in rhythmic patterns - communication, command, or perhaps just the 
creature's equivalent of focus.
More sahuagin pour into the chamber from the spoke-tunnels. Not fleeing -
 reporting. Each guard squad leader reaches the command cluster, delivers 
rapid clicking reports. The commanders organize them with swift efficiency 
into search parties, defense formations, rapid response units.
This is a professional military response to a prison break.
One of the priestesses approaches the tentacles. She places her webbed hands 
on the mucus-slicked surface. Her body goes rigid.
That layered voice speaks through her, but louder than before, echoing 
through the chamber:
"THE SURFACE-DWELLERS DARE. THEY THINK THEY CAN 
STEAL WHAT IS MINE. FIND THEM. BRING THEM BACK. MAKE 
THEM EXAMPLES. SHOW THEM THE PRICE OF DEFIANCE."
The priestess collapses, blood trickling from her gills - the mental contact was 
more forceful this time.
Warriors surge toward the spoke-tunnels in organized squads - 30, 40, 50 
sahuagin deploying to hunt the "escaped" prisoners who are already hundreds 
of feet above on ship decks being healed.
The aboleth is focusing outward, hunting for surface raiders it 
assumes are fleeing through the water.
It hasn't looked inward. Hasn't sensed Johannes watching from 90 
feet away.
More forces consolidate in the chamber - warriors returning from patrol 
routes, priestesses gathering near the tentacles for coordination, commanders 
forming a tactical center.
The creature is doing exactly what you predicted: consolidating 
forces for coordinated response, positioning itself to command the 
hunt personally.
Target concentration is increasing.
Still, Johannes remains motionless. Watching. Waiting for the optimal 
moment.
What are you waiting for specifically before signaling Salindra? 
Maximum force concentration? The aboleth to fully emerge? A 
specific formation or position?
She'll contact when she's ready, I have to remain undetected until then.
Dec 9
Absolutely right. Johannes remains perfectly still. His job is to observe and 
confirm when Salindra signals - not to initiate contact and risk the magical 
signature being detected.
Below, the consolidation continues. More warriors stream into the chamber - 
you count 500+ now, easily. The entire sahuagin force is being recalled to the 
central command post.
The tentacles have fully risen now, no longer resting casually on the floor. 
They're active, moving with slow, deliberate sweeps through the water. Not 
searching the chamber - the aboleth is focused outward, hunting for the 
surface raiders it assumes are escaping through the ocean.
Perfect.
The creature is alert, awake, angry - but looking in the wrong direction. Its 
forces are consolidated exactly where you need them. The timing couldn't be 
better.
5 minutes since the alarm.
The priestesses have formed a semicircle around the tentacles, hands 
outstretched, receiving coordinated commands. The warriors are organized 
into strike groups. The commanders coordinate patrol routes, search patterns, 
pursuit vectors.
Then you feel it - the Sending Stone activating.
Salindra's voice, calm and measured despite what she's about to do:
"Commander. All prisoners secured and stabilizing. Castellan Morrow and I 
in position. Confirm: Is target optimally positioned? Are forces maximally 
concentrated? Acknowledge when ready for Earthquake."
This is the moment.
Below you, 500+ sahuagin consolidated around an alert, active aboleth. The 
creature's main body is still in the deeper chamber, but its tentacles are fully 
extended upward into this space, connected to its priestesses, commanding its 
army.
Is this the optimal moment? Do you signal "Target positioned"?
Yes, bombs away
Dec 9
Johannes focuses on the Sending Stone, his mental voice absolutely steady:
"Target positioned. Forces maximally consolidated. Aboleth fully active, 
tentacles extended, command structure engaged. Five hundred plus hostiles 
in kill zone. Execute Earthquake. I confirm: bombs away."
Salindra's response is immediate, just two words:
"Mishakal's justice."
Then silence.
You brace yourself against the ancient stone, wedging tight into the alcove. 
You have perhaps 10-15 seconds before-
The chamber CONVULSES.
Even at this depth, through water, you feel it. The stone beneath and around 
you shudders. Not like a tremor - like the world itself is being shaken by an 
angry god.
Below, the sahuagin formations break immediately into chaos. Warriors 
tumble through the water. Priestesses lose their connection to the tentacles. 
The commanders try to maintain order but-
CRACK.
A massive support column splits from floor to ceiling. Stone debris begins 
falling - no, not falling, the water resistance makes it more like a 
deadly rain of rubble cascading through the chamber.
CRACK. CRACK. CRACK.
More columns fail. The ceiling begins collapsing in sections. Huge blocks of 
worked stone that have stood for millennia suddenly surrendering to 
Salindra's divine wrath.
The tentacles thrash - not in attack, but in reaction. The aboleth feels its 
prison, its fortress, its carefully prepared invasion staging ground collapsing 
around it.
And then you see it.
From the deeper opening, rising through the falling debris, the aboleth 
itself emerges.
Twenty feet of serpentine horror. Translucent flesh revealing internal organs 
that pulse with alien biology. Four tentacles whipping through the water. 
Three eyes - cold, ancient, furious - scanning the collapsing chamber for the 
source of this attack.
It's looking for enemies. For surface raiders. For whoever dared.
Its gaze sweeps past your alcove. The Nondetection and invisibility hold. You 
are nothing. A absence. A shadow in chaos.
The sahuagin are dying. Dozens crushed by falling stone. Others fleeing 
toward the spoke-tunnels, only to find them collapsing too. The entire 
structure is coming down.
The aboleth is trapped.
Massive stones fall around it. One tentacle gets pinned under rubble. The 
creature SCREAMS - not with sound, but with psychic force that even your 
Ring of Mind Shielding can't fully block. You feel the pressure of its rage, its 
disbelief, its FURY.
HOW. HOW DARE THEY. I WAS SO CLOSE. SO CLOSE TO FREEDOM.
More rubble. The chamber is compressing, exactly as planned. What was 200 
feet across is now maybe 150, and still shrinking as stone cascades down.
The aboleth tries to retreat deeper, but the opening behind it collapses 
entirely. Tons of ancient stone sealing it in.
It's trapped in a compressed kill zone with its entire army.
30 seconds since the Earthquake began.
Then, through the chaos, through the falling stone and dying sahuagin and 
thrashing aboleth, you see him:
War Mage Thalen, appearing via Dimension Door near the chamber floor, 
100 feet away from you. He's surrounded by falling debris, but he's fast. His 
hands move in practiced patterns, magical energy gathering.
He points at the center of the compressed space, where the aboleth struggles 
against the rubble.
A tiny point of light appears. Orange-red. Condensed. Delayed Blast 
Fireball.
Set for one minute.
Thalen immediately casts again - another Dimension Door - and vanishes.
45 seconds since Earthquake began.
The chamber continues collapsing. The aboleth is pinned under tons of stone 
now, only two tentacles still free, thrashing weakly. The sahuagin that aren't 
dead are trapped, crushed, drowning in collapsed tunnels.
And in the center of it all, that tiny point of light grows slowly brighter.
You need to leave. NOW.
Your alcove is still relatively stable, but the ceiling above is cracking. You have 
maybe 30 seconds before the Delayed Blast Fireball detonates with the force 
of a small sun in this compressed, underwater space.
Do you use your Dimension Door scroll to teleport to the surface 
immediately, or try to exit through the shaft where Cyrus is 
waiting?
Through the shaft, I don't leave him waiting
Dec 9
Johannes launches from the alcove, swimming hard toward the shaft 
entrance. The invisibility is irrelevant now - chaos reigns, no one is watching 
for infiltrators.
Debris falls around you. A sahuagin warrior tumbles past, crushed by falling 
stone. The water is thick with silt and blood.
You reach the shaft entrance.
Cyrus is there, positioned just inside, his face tight with controlled fear. He 
sees the water disturbance of your movement even though he can't see you.
"Johannes?!" he shouts over the grinding roar of collapsing stone.
"HERE!" You grab his arm - he can feel you even if he can't see you. "GO! UP! 
NOW!"
You both kick hard, ascending the shaft. Hand over hand on the carved holds 
when swimming isn't fast enough. The shaft is collapsing behind you - stone 
grinding, water pressure shifting violently.
100 feet up the shaft.
Below, that point of orange-red light is growing brighter. Thirty seconds 
maybe. Twenty.
150 feet.
The exit is ahead - you can see the two sentries abandoning their posts, fleeing 
into open water as the entire structure shakes itself apart.
You burst from the shaft entrance into open ocean.
Cyrus beside you, both swimming hard for the surface. Up. UP.
300 feet depth. 250 feet.
Behind and below, through the murky water, you see it:
The Delayed Blast Fireball detonates.
Even at this distance, through hundreds of feet of water, the pressure wave 
hits like a physical blow. The compressed chamber, the tons of rubble, the 
extreme depth - everything conspires to concentrate the magical force into a 
space the size of a small building.
The water around the detonation boils. The stone doesn't just collapse - 
it pulverizes. The shockwave radiates outward in a perfect sphere of 
destruction.
Everything in that chamber - aboleth, sahuagin, ancient ruins - is vaporized.
The pressure wave throws you and Cyrus upward, tumbling through the water. 
Cyrus grabs your arm - you grab his - holding each other as the ocean 
convulses.
200 feet. 150 feet.
You can see the hulls above now - Stormbreaker and Wave 
Dancer maintaining position.
100 feet. 50 feet.
You break the surface together, gasping despite the magical breathing. Sailors 
are already throwing ropes, reaching down.
Hands grab you, haul you aboard. Your invisibility fades as you cross the rail - 
sudden visibility, water streaming, alive.
Cyrus collapses on deck beside you, breathing hard. "Did we-"
"It's dead," you confirm. "It's dead."
Below, the water is still churning. Debris floats to the surface - shattered 
stone, dead sahuagin, the remnants of an ancient fortress.
High Priestess Salindra stands at the rail, her face pale but determined. War 
Mage Thalen is already aboard, leaning heavily against the mast, magically 
exhausted but alive.
Captain Andra approaches. "Commander?"
Johannes forces himself to stand, water streaming from his gear. He reaches 
into his pouch, pulls out the silver coin Salindra gave him, and hands it to her.
"Proof," he says simply. "It's me. Not a thrall."
She takes the coin, examines it, then smiles with fierce relief. "Welcome back, 
Commander Constantinius."
Across the deck, Kessa is there - returned from the Wave Dancer - her 
expression caught between relief and disbelief.
The healing teams are still working on the eleven rescued prisoners. Several 
are conscious now, confused, terrified, but alive.
The aboleth is dead. The invasion is stopped. The mission is 
complete.
What does Johannes do first?
Nope, not up. We have to do damage assessment, maybe a follow up strike if 
needed.
Dec 9
Johannes grabs the rail before anyone can pull him fully aboard, water still 
streaming from his gear. His tactical mind is already working through the 
aftermath.
"Wait. WAIT." He looks at Captain Andra, then Salindra. "We don't celebrate 
yet. We need damage assessment. Confirmation of kill. Secondary strike 
capability if anything survived."
Cyrus, still catching his breath beside him, nods immediately. "He's right. We 
can't assume-"
"The fireball detonated in a compressed space at 500 feet of depth," War Mage 
Thalen says, but he's not arguing - he's assessing. "The force would have been 
catastrophic. But aboleths are ancient, resilient..."
Admiral Kethren, who's been monitoring from the Wave Dancer, signals 
across: "Commander's right. We need eyes on target. Confirm the kill before 
we withdraw."
High Priestess Salindra looks troubled. "The entire structure collapsed. The 
fireball vaporized what remained. What could have survived that?"
"I don't know," Johannes says flatly. "Which is why we need to verify. Aboleths 
regenerate, hibernate, have contingencies we can't imagine. If even a piece of 
it survived, if it retreated deeper before the blast, if there's ANY chance it's still 
alive..." He doesn't finish, but everyone understands.
An aboleth that survives this will be enraged beyond measure.
Commander Voss, aboard via magical communication, speaks: 
"Reconnaissance dive. Small team, quick assessment, extraction if hostile 
contact. Who goes?"
Johannes is already moving toward the ladder. "I do. My invisibility is gone 
but I've got thirty minutes of Nondetection left. And I know what I'm looking 
for."
"Johannes, you just-" Kessa starts.
"I know what an aboleth looks like," he interrupts. "I know the chamber 
layout. I need to see the blast site, confirm nothing survived, check for escape 
tunnels or contingency chambers we didn't know about."
Cyrus stands wearily. "Then I'm going too. You're not doing another dive 
alone."
War Mage Thalen straightens despite his exhaustion. "I should go. I placed the 
fireball - I can assess whether the detonation was complete or if the spell was 
somehow contained or diverted."
Salindra raises her hand. "I can cast Scrying - observe the site remotely 
without risking more lives."
"How long?" Admiral Kethren asks.
"Ten minutes to prepare and cast. If the aboleth is dead, I'll see a corpse. If it's 
alive..." She doesn't finish.
Johannes considers. Scrying is safer - no one at risk. But it only shows what's 
visible, not what might be hidden in collapsed tunnels or deeper chambers.
What does Johannes recommend?
I use dimension door to relocate. My cloak of mantra should be enough to 
handle the pressure change.
Dec 9
Johannes pulls out one of his Dimension Door scrolls. "I'm using this. 500 feet 
range - gets me directly to the blast site and back. Cloak of Manta Ray handles 
the pressure adaptation. In and out, two minutes maximum."
"Alone?" Cyrus says sharply.
"Fastest way. I teleport down, assess the site, teleport back up if I need to or 
swim if it's clear. Nondetection is still active - anything that survived won't 
sense me easily." Johannes checks the scroll, his gear. "If I'm not back in five 
minutes, assume the worst and prepare follow-up strike."
Captain Andra looks like she wants to argue, but the tactical logic is sound. 
"You're sure about the pressure? That's 500 feet down, instant transition-"
"The Cloak adapts me to underwater environments. I've tested the limits 
before." Not quite true, but close enough. "And if something goes wrong, I still 
have the second Dimension Door scroll for emergency extraction."
High Priestess Salindra places her hand on his shoulder. "Then at least take 
this." She casts quickly - Death Ward. "If something kills you down there, this 
spell will bring you back from zero hit points once. Automatically. It lasts eight 
hours."
The magic settles over Johannes like a warm shroud. A life insurance policy.
Admiral Kethren nods grimly. "Five minutes, Commander. Then we assume 
you're compromised and Salindra scrys the site anyway."
Kessa grabs Johannes's arm. "You come back. That's twice in one day I'm 
ordering you not to die."
"Noted," he says.
War Mage Thalen hands him a glowing stone. "Sunrod. Magical light, 
waterproof. If it's too dark to see down there, this'll help. Just snap it to 
activate."
Johannes secures it, then unfurls the Dimension Door scroll. The magic is 
complex, seventh-level, but the scroll guides his mind through the casting. He 
pictures the blast site - the compressed chamber, the center where he last saw 
the aboleth trapped under rubble.
Reality tears open.
A doorway of shimmering magic appears on deck. Through it, distorted and 
distant, the underwater ruins.
Johannes steps through.
 
BLAST SITE - 500 FEET DEPTH - INSTANT TRANSITION
The Cloak of Manta Ray's magic surges, adapting your body immediately to 
the crushing pressure. Your gills engage. Your eyes adjust to the darkness.
You're in hell.
The chamber is... gone. Not collapsed - gone. Where there was once a 200-
foot space, there's now just compressed rubble and pulverized stone. The 
fireball and pressure didn't just destroy the structure - 
it compressed everything into a space maybe 50 feet across.
Dead sahuagin are everywhere - crushed, burned, some just... gone. 
Vaporized. Body parts scattered through the debris.
You snap the sunrod. Magical light floods the area.
And there, in the center of the devastation:
The aboleth.
Or what's left of it.
The body is shattered. Two of the tentacles are completely severed, drifting 
in the current. The main body is crushed under a massive stone block - you 
can see where the creature tried to shield itself, tried to use its tentacles to 
create space, but the force was too great.
One of its three eyes is ruptured. Ichor leaks from massive wounds. The 
translucent flesh is burned, torn, pulverized.
But-
Is it dead?
Roll Perception to examine the corpse carefully. Are there signs of 
life? Regeneration? Any movement?
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Perception with advantage (Trident of Warning) for you.
First roll: 20 + 5 = 25 Second roll: 8 + 5 = 13
Result: 25 - CRITICAL SUCCESS!
 
Johannes moves closer, sunrod held high, examining the massive corpse with 
methodical precision. Years of military experience - of checking bodies to 
confirm kills, of recognizing when an enemy is feigning death - guide his 
observation.
The aboleth is dead. Completely, utterly, permanently dead.
Here's what you see with absolute certainty:
The body temperature is already equalizing with the surrounding water. 
No metabolic heat. Aboleths are cold-blooded, but even they generate some 
warmth when alive. This is corpse-cold.
The mucus secretion has stopped entirely. The translucent flesh that 
should be constantly producing that viscous coating is dry - well, as dry as 
something underwater can be. The mucus production is an involuntary 
biological function. It doesn't stop unless the creature is dead.
The bioluminescence is gone. Those internal organs that pulsed with light 
- dark now. Completely dark. Not dimmed, not flickering - extinguished.
Most critically: You see massive internal damage through the translucent 
flesh. The creature's brain - a complex, multi-lobed organ near where the 
tentacles meet the body - is ruptured. Not just damaged. Destroyed. You 
can see where the pressure wave literally pulverized the neural tissue. Even an 
aboleth's legendary regeneration can't recover from having its brain turned to 
paste.
The two intact eyes are clouded, pupils fixed and dilated. The nictitating 
membranes are stuck half-open - a death spasm.
No gill movement. Even dead things sometimes twitch from residual nerve 
impulses. Nothing. This body has been dead long enough that even those 
reflexes have ceased.
You move around to check from different angles, looking for ANY sign of:
*	Breathing/water movement through gills: None
*	Tentacle reflexes: None
*	Regeneration starting (tissue regrowth, wound closure): None
*	Hidden escape tunnels or secondary chambers: The entire area is 
compressed rubble - nowhere to escape
Then you notice something else: The binding site.
Carved into the stone floor beneath where the aboleth's body now rests, you 
can see ancient runes. Heavily damaged by the collapse and fireball, but still 
visible. This was the center of the thousand-year-old binding.
The aboleth died exactly where it was originally imprisoned. It never 
escaped. Never tasted freedom. After a millennium of planning, gathering 
forces, counting down to liberation... it died in its cage.
There's a poetry to that. A justice.
You are absolutely certain: Khû'leth the Deep One is dead.
Around you, the devastation is complete. Maybe 30-40 sahuagin corpses 
visible in the rubble - the rest are buried or vaporized. No movement 
anywhere. No survivors. The entire operation - armies, priestesses, 
commanders, workshops, prisoners, invasion plans - obliterated.
You've been down here about ninety seconds.
Do you take anything as proof? A sample from the corpse? 
Documentation? Or just return with your eyewitness 
confirmation?
If there are valuable aboleth body parts, they go in the bag of holding. I'll also 
look to see if there's any loot from the lair. There's gotta be something, right?
Dec 9
Johannes's tactical mind immediately shifts to practical matters. An aboleth 
this ancient, this powerful, preparing an invasion for a millennium? 
There's definitely loot.
First: Aboleth body parts
You approach the massive corpse. The intact tentacles are each 20+ feet long - 
too large for your bag of holding unless you cut sections. But more valuable:
The eyes. You carefully extract one of the two intact eyes - each about the size 
of a dinner plate, clouded but still structurally sound. Aboleth eyes are 
legendary components for scrying magic and divination rituals. Worth a 
fortune to the right mage.
Brain tissue samples. Disgusting work, but you extract several vials worth 
of the pulverized neural matter. Aboleth brains contain knowledge - literal, 
physical memories encoded in the tissue. Alchemists and scholars pay 
incredible sums for this.
Mucus glands. You locate and carefully remove two intact glands from the 
neck area - these produce the transformation mucus. More valuable than gold 
to researchers studying aberrations.
Skin samples. The translucent flesh itself has properties - you cut several 
large pieces, roll them carefully.
All of this goes into your bag of holding.
Now: The Lair
You search through the rubble systematically. An aboleth doesn't hoard gold 
like a dragon, but it collects knowledge and power.
Roll Investigation to search the ruins for valuable items, magical 
artifacts, or hidden caches.
Systematic methodology search. I take my time after I send message 
confirming the aboleth is dead.
Dec 9
Smart. Johannes pulls out the Sending Stone first:
"Aboleth confirmed dead. Brain destroyed, no regeneration, corpse cold. 
Binding site intact underneath body - died in its prison. Collecting samples 
and searching for intelligence. Extend timer to fifteen minutes."
Salindra's response comes immediately, her mental voice flooded with relief:
"Praise Mishakal. Confirmed, fifteen minutes approved. Admiral Kethren is 
signaling fleet-wide stand down. Take your time, Commander. The threat is 
ended. Well done."
The connection fades.
Now Johannes can work methodically. No rush. No panic. Just systematic 
battlefield intelligence gathering - something he's done dozens of times after 
resistance victories.
He starts at the outer edges of the compressed chamber, working inward in a 
grid pattern. The sunrod's light reveals details in the rubble:
Roll Investigation for systematic search. Take your time, be 
thorough.
Roll
Dec 9
I'll roll Investigation for you.
Roll: 18 + 2 = 20 - Excellent!
 
Your systematic search pays off beautifully. An aboleth that planned for a 
millennium didn't keep everything in plain sight.
FIRST DISCOVERY: The Command Cache
Near where the sahuagin commanders were positioned, you find a sealed 
stone chest - crushed partially by rubble but intact enough to pry open. Inside, 
wrapped in waterproof materials:
*	Three spell scrolls (high level, you'd need to identify them properly, 
but the magical auras are strong)
*	A coral crown inlaid with black pearls - clearly ceremonial, probably 
worn by the high priestess. The pearls glow faintly with enchantment.
*	Navigation charts - waterproofed parchment showing coastal 
settlements, patrol routes, planned invasion vectors. Intelligence gold.
*	A journal in Sahuagin script - probably the command log. You can't 
read it, but scholars will want this.
SECOND DISCOVERY: The Workshop Stores
You find the remains of the cursed item workshop. Most items are destroyed, 
but in a sealed alcove:
*	Two intact clay vessels of aboleth mucus (in addition to your 
samples)
*	Enchanting tools - small hammers, inscribing needles, all magical. 
These were used to create the cursed items.
*	Raw materials: Rare shells, pieces of coral with natural magical 
properties, gemstones sized for socket work.
THIRD DISCOVERY: The Tribute Chamber
This is the big find. Behind a collapsed section of wall, you discover what 
appears to have been a vault. The aboleth collected tributes from its sahuagin 
servants, items they'd scavenged from shipwrecks and raids over decades:
*	1,847 gold pieces in various currencies (you estimate the weight)
*	A +1 trident (distinct from standard weapons, clearly masterwork)
*	A pearl of power (1st level) - allows recasting a spell once per day
*	Bracers of Defense - +2 AC when wearing no armor
*	A ring with an unusual dark blue stone that pulses faintly - unknown 
enchantment, needs identification
*	Three potions in sealed crystal vials - colors suggest healing (red), 
water breathing (blue-green), and something else (opalescent white)
*	A small locked iron box (you can't open it here, but it's clearly 
valuable enough to be locked)
FOURTH DISCOVERY: Knowledge Stones
Most valuable of all - you find what appear to be memory crystals. Aboleths 
store knowledge in physical form. There are five crystal spheres, each 
about fist-sized, that pulse with faint inner light. These likely contain:
*	Maps of underwater territories
*	Historical records
*	Magical knowledge
*	Intelligence on other threats/powers
Scholars and mages would pay fortunes for even one of these.
Everything fits in your bag of holding - barely. You're approaching 
capacity.
You've been down here about twelve minutes now. The site is thoroughly 
searched. You have:
*	Aboleth body parts (proof + valuable components)
*	Command intelligence (charts, journal, crown)
*	Magical items (scrolls, trident, bracers, ring, pearl, potions)
*	Knowledge crystals (priceless historical/magical data)
*	Gold and materials
*	The locked box (mystery contents)
Do you return to the surface now, or is there anything else you 
want to examine?
Search the remains of the outer lair, where the aboleth died, to see if there 
items left there. If not, head to the surface in the usual way - avoiding pressure 
sickness, but use message to inform topside about my plans.
Dec 9
Johannes moves to the center of the devastation, where the aboleth's corpse 
rests on top of the ancient binding runes. If the creature had any personal 
treasures, any items it kept closest to itself, they'd be here.
He carefully shifts rubble near the body, searches beneath the tentacles, 
examines the area around where its main body lies crushed.
Roll Investigation one more time for the aboleth's personal area.
Roll...and check where the priest/priestsess were too.
Dec 9
I'll roll Investigation for you.
Roll: 9 + 2 = 11
 
You search methodically around the aboleth's body and where the priestesses 
were conducting their rituals. The compression and devastation make it 
difficult - much is pulverized or buried under tons of rubble that would take 
hours to shift.
Around the aboleth's body:
You find fragments of what might have been valuable items - a shattered 
crystal that probably held knowledge, pieces of worked metal that suggest 
jewelry or regalia, but nothing intact enough to be worth taking. The fireball's 
heat at this proximity literally melted or shattered most delicate items.
BUT - partially buried under the aboleth's body, you spot something: A 
stone tablet, about two feet square, carved with those same alien runes that 
cover the walls. It's cracked but largely intact. This was positioned directly 
under where the aboleth rested - possibly something it was studying, or 
something related to the binding itself. The runes seem to shimmer faintly 
even now.
You pry it free and add it to your bag.
Near the priestess ritual area:
Most of the priestesses' personal items were destroyed, but you find:
*	Two ceremonial daggers with handles carved from some kind of 
deep-sea bone, blades etched with ritual markings. Magical aura 
suggests they were used in the transformation rituals.
*	A necklace made of small bones strung on wire, with a central piece 
that looks like a fossilized tooth from something massive. It radiates 
faint necromantic energy.
*	Ritual components - mostly destroyed, but you collect a few intact 
pieces: rare minerals, preserved organs in sealed jars, materials that 
scholars studying aberration magic would want.
That's about all you can recover without heavy excavation equipment. The 
compression was simply too thorough.
You secure everything, then pull out the Sending Stone:
"Finishing search. Found significant intelligence and magical items. 
Returning via normal ascent to avoid pressure issues. Will surface in 
approximately ten minutes. Request retrieval team ready at ladder."
Salindra responds:
"Acknowledged. Ships standing by. The prisoners are stable - eight fully 
conscious, three still recovering. Take your time ascending safely. We're not 
going anywhere."
You begin your ascent. Slow, controlled, letting your body adjust to the 
pressure changes naturally despite the Cloak's protection. No reason to risk 
the bends after surviving everything else.
450 feet... 400 feet... 350 feet...
The ruins fall away below you. You pass through the depth where Cyrus waited 
at the shaft entrance earlier.
300 feet... 250 feet...
The water grows lighter, warmer. You can see both ships' hulls clearly now.
200 feet... 150 feet...
Almost there. Your bag of holding is heavy with treasures and intelligence.
100 feet... 50 feet...
You break the surface.
Sunlight. Air. The sound of sailors cheering as they see you emerge.
Hands reach down - Cyrus is there first, grabbing your arm. Kessa on the other 
side. They haul you aboard the Stormbreaker.
The moment your feet hit the deck, the cheering intensifies. Sailors, clerics, 
even Admiral Kethren aboard the Wave Dancer raising his hat in salute.
High Priestess Salindra approaches, her expression radiating relief and pride. 
"Commander Constantinius. Report?"
Johannes unslings the bag of holding, sets it on the deck with a heavy thunk.
"The aboleth is dead. Confirmed kill - brain destroyed, no regeneration 
possible. I have body samples as proof, plus significant intelligence materials 
and recovered artifacts from the lair."
He pulls out one of the massive aboleth eyes - the size of a dinner plate - and 
sets it on the deck. Sailors recoil slightly, but Salindra's eyes widen with 
recognition.
"Mishakal's mercy. That's... that's an intact eye from an ancient aboleth. 
Commander, do you understand what you've brought back?"
"Valuable magical components," Johannes says. "Plus navigation charts 
showing their invasion plans, command journals, memory crystals containing 
historical knowledge, and various magical items we'll need identified."
He looks around the deck at the assembled strike team - exhausted, wounded, 
but alive. All of them.
"The threat is ended. The coastal settlements are safe. And we have eleven 
people who get to go home to their families."
Captain Andra steps forward. "Commander Constantinius, on behalf of Ak-
Thyln's naval forces and the people of the coast... thank you."
Admiral Kethren's voice carries across the water from the Wave Dancer: 
"THREE CHEERS FOR COMMANDER CONSTANTINIUS AND THE STRIKE 
TEAM! HIP HIP-"
"HOORAY!"
"HIP HIP-"
"HOORAY!"
"HIP HIP-"
"HOORAY!"
Kessa leans close, grinning. "So... about those free drinks for life?"
What does Johannes do?
Wait for the grog to flow, then rest as the fleet heads back to port.
Dec 9
Johannes manages a tired smile at Kessa. "Let's get back to port first. Then 
we'll see about bankrupting myself in every tavern on the coast."
Captain Andra is already calling orders: "All hands! Set course for Ak-Thyln! 
Full sail - let's get our heroes home!"
Within minutes, both ships are underway, cutting through the waves toward 
the distant harbor. The mood aboard is jubilant - sailors singing work songs, 
the rescued prisoners sitting on deck wrapped in blankets, slowly realizing 
they're actually safe.
Someone produces a bottle of rum. Then another. Then several more. The 
grog starts flowing as the adrenaline fades and the reality of survival sets in.
War Mage Thalen accepts a cup with shaking hands. "I've cast combat magic 
for twenty years. Never anything like that."
"You placed that fireball perfectly," Johannes says, accepting his own cup. 
"Right in the center of the compressed space. Textbook execution."
"Textbook execution of an insane plan," Thalen corrects, but he's smiling. 
"Which somehow actually worked."
High Priestess Salindra declines the alcohol but sits with the group, her 
exhaustion evident. "Two Teleports and an Earthquake in combat conditions. 
I'm going to sleep for a week after we dock."
Castellan Morrow just grunts agreement, already half-asleep against the mast.
Cyrus finds Johannes at the rail, hands him a fresh cup. "To impossible 
victories."
"To not dying," Johannes counters.
"To not dying," Cyrus agrees, and they drink.
Kessa appears with a mostly-empty bottle. "One of the rescued fishermen just 
asked if we killed 'the monster.' I told him yes. He started crying." Her voice is 
softer than usual. "His son was one of the other prisoners. They're over there, 
reunited."
Johannes looks where she's pointing. A middle-aged man holding a younger 
man, both crying, both alive.
"That's why we did this," he says quietly. "That right there."
The ships sail on. The sun climbs higher. Johannes finds a spot on deck, his 
back against the rail, and lets himself finally rest. The bag of holding sits 
beside him, full of treasures and proof. The Trident of Warning rests across his 
lap. His companions are nearby, safe.
The coast grows larger on the horizon. Ak-Thyln's harbor comes into view - 
and there are crowds at the docks. Word has already spread via magical 
communication. The city knows their strike team succeeded.
As the ships approach, Johannes can see:
*	Banners being raised
*	People gathering at the waterfront
*	Temple bells beginning to ring
*	Admiral Kethren's flagship displaying full honors
Captain Andra grins from the helm. "Commander, I think you're about to 
become very famous. And very drunk, if the welcome committee has anything 
to say about it."
Johannes looks at Cyrus and Kessa. "You two are helping me with this, right?"
"Absolutely not," Kessa says cheerfully. "You led this mission. You get to enjoy 
every minute of being the hero."
"I'll help you to the temple afterward," Cyrus offers. "Someone needs to make 
sure you don't die of alcohol poisoning after surviving an aboleth."
The Stormbreaker glides into dock. The crowd erupts in cheers.
 
LATER THAT EVENING - AFTER THE CELEBRATIONS
Hours later, after the official debriefing, after the speeches and toasts and 
celebrations, after the rescued prisoners were reunited with families, after the 
treasures were catalogued and the intelligence materials secured...
Johannes finally makes it to the temple quarters assigned to the strike team. 
His head is buzzing pleasantly from excellent wine, his body exhausted but 
satisfied.
Cyrus is already asleep in one bed, still in his armor, too tired to even remove 
it.
Kessa sits by the window, looking out at the harbor. "Can't sleep?"
"Too much to process," she admits. "We actually did it. Killed an ancient 
horror, saved eleven lives, stopped an invasion..." She trails off. "What do we 
even do after something like this?"
Johannes sits beside her. "Rest. Recover. Figure out what comes next."
"And your curse? Your patron?" She keeps her voice low. "Nine months until 
the next tribute."
"I have the Binding Tome," Johannes says. "And now resources, connections, 
evidence that I can accomplish impossible things." He looks at her. "We're 
closer than we've ever been, Keys."
She nods slowly. "Good. Because I didn't survive fighting an aboleth just to 
watch that demon claim you."
They sit in comfortable silence, watching the celebration lights still burning in 
the city below.
Tomorrow will bring new challenges. The Dragon War continues. Johannes's 
curse remains. Haven needs coordination with Ak-Thyln. There's still work to 
be done.
But tonight... tonight they're alive, victorious, and safe.

Dec 9
LOOT IDENTIFICATION & 
PROCESSING
NEXT MORNING - TEMPLE ARCHIVES
Johannes wakes with only a mild headache - surprisingly merciful given last 
night's celebrations. He finds Cyrus and Kessa already up, and together they 
carry the bag of holding to the temple's identification chambers.
High Priestess Salindra has assembled an expert team:
*	Brother Aldric (Lorekeeper - historical/ancient items)
*	War Mage Thalen (arcane identification)
*	Master Artificer Keldin (magical item crafting specialist from the 
city)
*	Scholar Vess (aberration researcher, specifically interested in aboleth 
materials)
They spread everything across a large examination table. Admiral Kethren 
arrives with Commander Voss - military intelligence wants first look at the 
strategic materials.
 
ABOLETH BODY PARTS
Scholar Vess examines these first, eyes gleaming with academic 
fervor:
1. Aboleth Eye (intact)
*	Value: 5,000 gp to the right buyer
*	Uses: Primary component for Scrying spells, can be ground into powder 
for True Seeing potions, or preserved whole as a focus for divination 
magic
*	Vess's assessment: "This alone justifies the entire expedition. An intact 
eye from an ancient aboleth is... unprecedented in modern scholarship."
2. Brain Tissue Samples (6 vials)
*	Value: 2,000 gp per vial (12,000 gp total)
*	Uses: Contains literal memories - alchemical processing can extract 
knowledge, or consumed raw by certain rituals (extremely dangerous)
*	Vess's assessment: "These samples contain a thousand years of 
planning, observations, magical knowledge. We could learn... gods, we 
could learn so much."
3. Mucus Glands (2 intact)
*	Value: 3,000 gp each (6,000 gp total)
*	Uses: Source material for transformation research, component in 
potions of water breathing (superior quality), basis for anti-aberration 
weapons
*	Vess's assessment: "The temple will want to purchase these for 
defensive research. We need to understand how to counter aboleth 
mucus if we ever face another."
4. Skin Samples (multiple pieces)
*	Value: 1,500 gp total
*	Uses: Can be worked into armor or cloaks with water-resistance 
properties, component in certain protective enchantments
*	Vess's assessment: "Exotic armor crafting material. Lightweight, 
flexible, naturally magical."
ABOLETH MATERIALS TOTAL VALUE: 29,500 gp
 
STRATEGIC INTELLIGENCE
Admiral Kethren and Commander Voss examine these:
5. Navigation Charts (waterproofed parchment)
*	Military Value: Priceless for coastal defense
*	Contents: Shows planned invasion vectors, sahuagin patrol routes, 
deep-water passages, and marked locations of other potential 
underwater threats
*	Kethren's assessment: "These charts show us vulnerabilities we didn't 
know we had. And three other marked sites that might be similar 
threats. We need to investigate those locations immediately."
6. Command Journal (Sahuagin script)
*	Value: Will take weeks to translate fully
*	Contents: Day-to-day operations log, force deployments, prisoner 
processing records
*	Aldric's assessment: "I can read some Sahuagin. This details their entire 
operation over the past six months. We'll learn their command 
structure, how they recruited, what their goals were beyond invasion."
7. Coral Crown (black pearls, ceremonial)
*	War Mage Thalen casts Identify
*	IDENTIFIED: Crown of Underwater Command
*	Allows wearer to breathe water (permanent)
*	Grants advantage on Charisma checks with aquatic creatures
*	Once per day: cast Command (DC 15) that works on aquatic 
creatures specifically
*	Value: 8,000 gp
*	Thalen's assessment: "Ceremonial but functional. The high priestess 
used this to coordinate sahuagin forces. Could be valuable for future 
underwater diplomacy or operations."
INTELLIGENCE MATERIALS: Navigation charts and journal 
retained by military/temple. Crown available for party use or sale.
 
WORKSHOP MATERIALS
Master Artificer Keldin examines these:
8. Two Clay Vessels of Aboleth Mucus
*	Value: 4,000 gp each (8,000 gp total)
*	Note: Identical to your sample vials but in larger quantities
*	Keldin's assessment: "Dangerous to handle but incredibly valuable. The 
temple will definitely want these for research."
9. Enchanting Tools (magical)
*	Keldin picks them up reverently
*	Value: 3,500 gp as a set
*	Uses: These were used to create the cursed items. With proper study, 
could be repurposed for legitimate enchanting work at enhanced 
efficiency
*	Keldin's assessment: "These tools are... exquisite. Dark purpose, yes, but 
the craftsmanship is masterful. +2 to enchanting checks if used by a 
skilled artificer."
10. Raw Materials (shells, coral, gemstones)
*	Value: 2,200 gp worth of exotic materials
*	Uses: Components for water-themed magic items or jewelry
*	Keldin's assessment: "High quality materials. Could offset costs if you're 
commissioning custom magical items."
WORKSHOP MATERIALS TOTAL: 13,700 gp value
 
TRIBUTE VAULT TREASURES
The main haul. War Mage Thalen begins systematic identification:
11. Gold Coins
*	Counted precisely: 1,847 gold pieces in various currencies (some 
quite old)
*	All convertible to standard currency
12. +1 Trident
*	IDENTIFIED: Standard +1 magical weapon
*	Value: 1,000 gp (or keep for use)
*	Note: Superior to standard tridents, would be excellent backup weapon 
or gift to naval ally
13. Pearl of Power (1st level)
*	IDENTIFIED: Once per day, regain one expended 1st-level spell slot
*	Value: 500 gp (underselling it - more valuable in use)
*	Thalen's assessment: "Extremely useful for any spellcaster. I'd 
recommend keeping this rather than selling."
14. Bracers of Defense
*	IDENTIFIED: +2 AC when wearing no armor or light armor
*	Value: 6,000 gp
*	Thalen's assessment: "Perfect for Kessa or any unarmored combatant. 
Significantly increases survivability."
15. Ring with Dark Blue Stone
*	Thalen casts Identify, then his eyebrows rise
*	IDENTIFIED: Ring of Water Walking
*	Walk on liquid surfaces as if solid ground
*	Movement speed unchanged
*	Can activate/deactivate as bonus action
*	Value: 4,000 gp
*	Thalen's assessment: "Situational but incredibly useful when you need 
it. Maritime operations, swamp navigation, escaping across water..."
16. Three Potions
*	Red: Potion of Superior Healing (8d4+8 HP restored)
*	Blue-Green: Potion of Water Breathing (lasts 8 hours, can affect up to 
10 creatures)
*	Opalescent White: Thalen frowns, casts additional divinations...
*	IDENTIFIED: Potion of Gaseous Form
*	Transform into misty cloud for 1 hour
*	Fly 10 feet per round, can pass through small openings
*	Resistance to nonmagical damage
*	Values: 500 gp, 300 gp, 1,000 gp respectively
*	Thalen's assessment: "The gaseous form potion is rare and valuable. 
Incredible escape tool or infiltration aid."
17. Locked Iron Box
*	Master Artificer Keldin examines the lock
*	"This is... complex. Magical and mechanical. Give me a moment."
*	He works for ten minutes with tools and Knock spell
*	The box opens with a satisfying click
INSIDE THE BOX:
*	500 platinum pieces (5,000 gp value!)
*	A small black diamond (Keldin estimates 2,000 gp value)
*	A folded piece of aged parchment
Brother Aldric carefully unfolds the parchment. His expression goes from 
curious to shocked.
"This is... this is a deed. To a property in..." he squints at the faded text, 
"...Palanthas. A warehouse district property, pre-Cataclysm. Probably 
worthless now given the city's changes, but if the building still stands and the 
deed is honored..." He looks up. "This could be worth investigating."
 
KNOWLEDGE CRYSTALS
Brother Aldric handles these last, with almost religious reverence:
18. Five Memory Crystals (fist-sized, pulsing with inner light)
He places one in a special cradle, casts divination magic, and projects the 
contents into the air as shimmering images and text.
Crystal 1: DEEP OCEAN CARTOGRAPHY
*	Complete maps of underwater territories within 500 miles
*	Locations of other aberration lairs (3 marked)
*	Safe passage routes through deep trenches
*	Value: Priceless to naval operations and exploration
Crystal 2: HISTORICAL RECORDS
*	Aboleth observations of surface civilizations over 1,000 years
*	Pre-Cataclysm knowledge preserved
*	Details about the original binding ritual
*	Value: Priceless to scholars and historians
Crystal 3: MAGICAL THEORY
*	Aberration magic principles
*	Water-based spell modifications
*	Binding and unbinding techniques
*	Value: Could advance magical research by decades
Crystal 4: CONTEMPORARY INTELLIGENCE
*	Information gathered by sahuagin scouts over past 50 years
*	Details on other underwater powers and threats
*	Knowledge about Dragon Army naval activities (!)
*	Value: Critical for current military planning
Crystal 5: ABOLETH SPECIES KNOWLEDGE
*	Biology, psychology, weaknesses of aboleths
*	How to identify, track, and potentially negotiate with them
*	Counter-tactics and defensive measures
*	Value: Literally life-saving if anyone ever faces another aboleth
Brother Aldric looks overwhelmed. "Commander Constantinius... these 
crystals represent more knowledge than our entire temple archive contains on 
underwater threats. This is... this is a treasure beyond treasures."
Admiral Kethren steps forward. "The military intelligence in crystal four alone 
could change how we fight the Dragon Army's naval operations."
High Priestess Salindra speaks carefully: "These crystals... we cannot put a 
gold value on them. But their worth to Ak-Thyln, to Haven, to all coastal 
cities... immeasurable."
 
RITUAL ITEMS
19. Stone Tablet (alien runes, from under aboleth's body)
*	Brother Aldric studies it intensely
*	"This is... part of the original binding ritual. The runes describe the 
anchoring mechanism. With this and the historical crystal, we could 
theoretically recreate binding magic for other aberrations."
*	Value: Academic/magical research treasure
20. Two Ceremonial Daggers (bone handles, ritual markings)
*	IDENTIFIED: Used in transformation rituals
*	+1 magical daggers
*	Special: Wounds inflicted ignore resistance to necrotic damage
*	Value: 1,500 gp each (3,000 gp total), or keep as weapons
21. Necklace (bones, fossilized tooth centerpiece)
*	IDENTIFIED: Amulet of the Depths
*	Grants resistance to cold damage
*	Advantage on saving throws against being frightened by 
aberrations
*	Once per day: cast Speak with Dead (no components required)
*	Value: 5,000 gp
*	Thalen's assessment: "Creepy as hell, but genuinely powerful. The fear 
resistance alone is valuable for anyone fighting aberrations."
RITUAL ITEMS TOTAL: Tablet (priceless research value), Daggers 
(3,000 gp), Necklace (5,000 gp)

DISTRIBUTION DISCUSSION
High Priestess Salindra speaks: "Commander Constantinius, this haul 
rightfully belongs to you and your strike team. However, I must make formal 
offers on behalf of Ak-Thyln:"
TEMPLE OFFERS:
*	Will purchase all aboleth body parts for 35,000 gp (premium over 
market value)
*	Will purchase mucus vessels for 10,000 gp total (premium)
*	Requests access to knowledge crystals for research (compensated 
separately)
*	Requests loan of stone tablet for binding research
MILITARY OFFERS:
*	Will purchase navigation charts for 5,000 gp
*	Requests copy/access to Crystal 4 (contemporary intelligence)
*	Offers formal gratitude and ongoing relationship with Haven forces
Admiral Kethren adds: "We're also prepared to offer equipment upgrades, 
naval transport priority, and trade agreements as additional compensation."
JOHANNES, CYRUS, AND KESSA - What do you want to:
1.	KEEP for personal use?
2.	SELL to temple/military?
3.	Donate/trade for other benefits?
As a token of good faith, and in appreciation for the temple and navy's 
willingness to accept the word of three complete strangers, I offer the aboleth 
parts, maps, and crystals as gifts on behalf of Haven and our hopes for 
positive working relationships going forward. There is no expectation of a 
formal alliance, but we hope this represents what we want to offer moving 
forward.
The same with the stone tablet. The other crystals are also bequeathed to the 
temple, with the expectation that they be made available for access and use 
by all without cost or restriction, within reasonable parameters. No taxes, no 
customs, no making money - these were obtained by the work of people 
joined in common cause, and should be used in the same way.
Dec 9
The chamber goes absolutely silent.
High Priestess Salindra's expression shifts from professional negotiation to 
genuine shock. Brother Aldric's mouth actually falls open. Admiral Kethren 
slowly sets down the navigation chart he was holding.
War Mage Thalen speaks first, voice quiet: "Commander... do you understand 
what you just offered? That's over forty thousand gold pieces in materials 
alone, not counting the priceless intelligence value..."
Johannes meets their eyes steadily. "I understand exactly what I'm offering. 
Three strangers arrived in your city warning about a threat you had no reason 
to believe. You didn't demand proof first. You didn't hesitate. You assembled 
resources, committed your High Priestess and senior military leadership to a 
mission that could have been a catastrophic trap."
He gestures to Cyrus and Kessa. "We came asking for help against an 
impossible enemy. You gave it without negotiation, without contracts, without 
requiring payment up front. That's not how most cities operate during 
wartime."
Cyrus steps forward, his cleric's robes still showing salt stains from yesterday. 
"The knowledge in those crystals - information about aberrations, binding 
magic, defensive techniques - that shouldn't be locked behind paywalls or 
political alliances. The next coastal city that faces an aboleth shouldn't die 
because they couldn't afford the research."
Kessa adds, arms crossed: "And honestly? We killed the thing because it was 
the right thing to do, not for profit. The gold and magic items are nice. The 
knowledge... that belongs to everyone who might need it."
High Priestess Salindra's eyes are bright with emotion. She stands, moves 
around the table, and places both hands on Johannes's shoulders - not as a 
priestess to a soldier, but as an equal to an equal.
"Commander Constantinius. In thirty years of temple service, I have witnessed 
greed, politics, and self-interest dominate nearly every major decision. What 
you just offered..." She pauses, composing herself. "This is what Mishakal 
teaches. Healing and knowledge shared freely. Community over profit. 
Compassion over advantage."
She steps back, addresses the room formally: "On behalf of the Temple of 
Mishakal in Ak-Thyln, I accept these gifts in the spirit they are offered. The 
knowledge crystals will be placed in our public archives - any scholar, any 
researcher, any person seeking to protect their community will have access 
without cost."
Brother Aldric wipes his eyes. "The aboleth materials will fund defensive 
research that we'll share freely. The binding techniques... gods, we can teach 
cities how to prepare for these threats before they become invasions."
Admiral Kethren stands at attention, then salutes - formal military honors. 
"Commander Constantinius, Brother Cyrus, Miss Darrow. On behalf of Ak-
Thyln's naval forces and the people of this city..." His voice is rough with 
emotion. "Thank you. This is the beginning of something that could save 
thousands of lives up and down the coast."
Commander Voss adds: "Haven spoke of you as legendary resistance leaders. 
Now I understand why. This is leadership that puts people before power."
Master Artificer Keldin speaks up: "If I may... while I respect the incredible 
generosity, the Commander and his companions still risked their lives. The 
remaining items - the magical equipment, the gold, the personal treasures - 
those are rightfully yours. But..." He pauses. "If you'll permit, I'd like to offer 
my services free of charge for any magical item crafting or enhancement you 
might need. It's the least I can do."
War Mage Thalen nods. "And I'll provide magical identification and 
consultation whenever you need it. No charge. Consider it professional 
courtesy between people who actually give a damn about protecting 
innocents."
High Priestess Salindra smiles. "And the temple offers this: healing services 
for you and your companions, free of charge, for life. Spells, potions, 
restoration magic - whatever you need, whenever you need it. In Ak-Thyln or 
anywhere our temple has presence."
Admiral Kethren adds: "Naval transport for Haven personnel and supplies - 
priority scheduling, no fees. Trade routes established with preferential terms. 
And..." He glances at Commander Voss, who nods. "Military intelligence 
sharing. Anything we learn about Dragon Army naval operations, you hear 
about it immediately."
"We're not creating a formal alliance," Salindra clarifies. "As you said - no 
expectations, no obligations. But we're creating something better: trust. 
Partnership between free peoples who share common values."
She looks at the assembled experts. "Document this moment. Let it be known 
that on this day, Haven and Ak-Thyln began a relationship built not on 
contracts and gold, but on mutual respect and shared purpose."
Brother Aldric is already writing furiously.
The High Priestess turns back to Johannes. "Now, let's discuss what you're 
keeping. You've been generous beyond measure - allow us to be grateful by 
ensuring you're properly equipped for whatever comes next."
 
REMAINING ITEMS FOR JOHANNES'S PARTY
Currency:
*	1,847 gp
*	500 pp (5,000 gp value)
*	Black diamond (2,000 gp)
*	Total liquid: 8,847 gp to split or pool
Magical Items Available:
*	+1 Trident
*	Pearl of Power (1st level)
*	Bracers of Defense (+2 AC)
*	Ring of Water Walking
*	Crown of Underwater Command
*	Potion of Superior Healing
*	Potion of Water Breathing (party-sized)
*	Potion of Gaseous Form
*	Two +1 Ceremonial Daggers
*	Amulet of the Depths
*	Enchanting Tools (if keeping)
*	Raw materials (2,200 gp worth)
*	Palanthas property deed
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA - How do you want to distribute the 
remaining loot among yourselves? Any items you specifically want? 
Sell anything? Keep the gold pooled or divide it?
Keldin gets the tools, if for no other reason than no one else wants them. 
Kessa and Cyrus can take whatever they want; I am good, I don't need 
anything. Well, maybe replace the two Greater Potions of Healing from a 
vendor, but otherwise, it's all icing on the cake to me.
Dec 9
Kessa immediately speaks up: "The Bracers of Defense. I'll take those if no one 
objects." She picks them up, slides them onto her forearms. "+2 AC in light 
armor? That's the difference between dodging and dying. Thank you, 
Johannes."
Cyrus considers the remaining items thoughtfully. "The Pearl of Power would 
be incredibly useful - regaining a spell slot during critical moments could save 
lives." He picks it up, examines it. "And... the Amulet of the Depths, actually. 
Resistance to cold and advantage against fear from aberrations? Given what 
we fight, that's practical." He looks slightly uncomfortable with the bone 
necklace but secures it anyway.
Master Artificer Keldin accepts the enchanting tools with genuine gratitude. 
"I'll put these to better use than their original purpose, I promise you. And 
Commander - those Greater Healing Potions? Consider them replaced free of 
charge. I'll have them ready before you leave port."
Kessa eyes the remaining items. "What about the +1 Trident? Johannes, you're 
already using the Trident of Warning, so this one's spare..."
"Naval gift," Johannes suggests. "Admiral, would one of your officers benefit 
from a magical trident? Consider it a token from Haven to Ak-Thyln's 
defenders."
Admiral Kethren looks touched. "Our new watch commander lost her weapon 
in a recent skirmish with Dragon Army raiders. This would mean a great deal 
to her. Thank you."
Cyrus picks up the Potion of Water Breathing. "This one's party-sized - affects 
up to ten people. We should keep it. Never know when we'll need underwater 
operations again."
"Agreed," Kessa says. She takes the Potion of Superior Healing. "I'll carry this 
one. And the Gaseous Form potion..." She grins. "That's an infiltrator's dream. 
Turning into mist? Yes please."
That leaves on the table:
*	Ring of Water Walking
*	Crown of Underwater Command
*	Two +1 Ceremonial Daggers
*	Raw materials (2,200 gp worth)
*	Palanthas property deed
*	8,847 gp in currency/gems
Johannes looks at the Ring of Water Walking. "Situational but useful. Should 
we keep it for party use, or...?"
"Keep it," Cyrus advises. "Water walking could be crucial in future operations. 
Someone should attune it."
Kessa holds up the Crown of Underwater Command with amusement. "This 
is... gaudy. And specifically for underwater diplomacy. Unless we're planning 
to negotiate with more aquatic creatures?"
"Sell it," Johannes decides. "Or gift it to Ak-Thyln's naval operations. They'd 
get more use from it than we would."
Admiral Kethren accepts it. "We do occasionally need to deal with dolphins, 
sea elves, and other intelligent aquatic beings. This could be valuable for 
coastal diplomacy. If you're certain?"
"Certain."
The +1 Ceremonial Daggers - Kessa examines them. "These are well-balanced, 
and the necrotic damage bypass is useful. I could use them as thrown weapons 
or melee backup." She secures them. "If no one objects?"
"They're yours," Johannes confirms.
Brother Aldric speaks up about the raw materials: "Those exotic components - 
if you don't need them immediately, I could arrange for them to be sold 
through temple channels. Premium prices, proceeds to you. Or you could keep 
them for future magic item commissions."
"Sell them," Johannes says. "Add the proceeds to our operating funds."
"That'll bring you to roughly 11,000 gold," Aldric calculates.
Then there's the Palanthas property deed. Everyone stares at it.
"Pre-Cataclysm property in Palanthas," Cyrus muses. "The city's changed 
drastically. Could be worthless, could be valuable, could be dangerous to 
investigate during wartime..."
Kessa grins. "Or it could be an adventure for another day. Keep it. Worst case, 
it's an interesting piece of paper. Best case, we own a warehouse in one of 
Krynn's major cities."
"Agreed," Johannes says. "We'll investigate when circumstances permit."

High Priestess Salindra surveys the final distribution with approval. "Practical, 
generous, and wise. You kept what serves your mission, shared what serves 
the greater good."
Admiral Kethren adds: "The formal documentation of our relationship will be 
ready within days. Trade agreements, intelligence sharing protocols, mutual 
defense consultation..." He smiles. "Not an alliance. A partnership."
War Mage Thalen hands Johannes a small card. "My personal contact 
information. If you ever need magical consultation, identification, or just 
someone who understands what you face out there - send word."
Master Artificer Keldin does the same. "And when you want something 
custom crafted, you come to me first. Friends and family rates."
Brother Aldric approaches with a beautifully bound book - already completed 
despite being started only minutes ago. "The official record of this agreement. 
For your archives in Haven, and ours here."
The book's title reads: The Compact of Shared Purpose: Haven and 
Ak-Thyln, Forged in Defense Against the Deep
"Bit dramatic," Kessa mutters, but she's smiling.
"History should be dramatic," Aldric insists. "People need to remember not 
just what happened, but why it mattered."
What do Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa do next? Rest another day in 
Ak-Thyln? Head back to Haven immediately? Investigate 
something else?
I'd take it as a personal favor if the families of those who lost loved ones (the 
ship crews, etc.) were recompensed appropriately for their losses, and the 
three settlements were assisted in replacing what was lost. especially Saltmere, 
with all the traps and other accoutrements that were spent in its defense. And 
with that, we need to head back to Haven; it has been too long since we were 
involved in the comings and goings there, and besides, Commandant 
Lauranna will need to get her hands on this first edition.
Dec 9
High Priestess Salindra nods immediately. "Consider it done, Commander. 
The temple will see to compensation for the Silver Catch crew's families and 
the other victims. And the three settlements - we'll ensure they're not just 
restored, but better defended. Magical early warning systems, protective 
wards, trained militias."
Admiral Kethren adds: "The naval patrols in that region will be tripled. Those 
villages won't be vulnerable again."
Brother Aldric carefully hands Johannes the beautifully bound book. "For 
Commandant Laurana. First edition, as you said. Please give her our regards - 
Haven's reputation precedes itself, and after this..." He gestures to everything 
that's transpired. "We're honored to call you partners."
Johannes accepts the book, secures it carefully. "Saltmere's defenses 
particularly - they spent significant resources preparing for the sahuagin 
assault. Traps, fortifications, watchmen's wages. Make sure they're reimbursed 
fully."
"Documented and approved," Commander Voss confirms. "The council will 
vote on it this afternoon, but after what you've done? It'll pass unanimously."
Kessa stretches. "So. Back to Haven. How are we traveling? I'm assuming not 
three days on horseback after everything..."
Captain Andra steps forward with a grin. "The Stormbreaker can have you to 
Haven's port in a day and a half with favorable winds. And after yesterday, I'd 
consider it an honor to transport the heroes who killed an aboleth."
"Plus," Admiral Kethren adds, "it gives us chance to coordinate properly. 
Naval intelligence sharing starts now - we'll brief you on Dragon Army 
maritime movements during the voyage."
Cyrus looks relieved. "A day and a half on a ship sounds infinitely better than 
three days of riding. My body is still complaining about yesterday's depth 
changes."
Johannes nods. "Then we leave this afternoon? That gives us time for final 
preparations, proper farewells, and ensuring the compensation arrangements 
are formalized."
"And one more proper meal on solid ground," Kessa adds. "Before we're back 
to ship's rations."
High Priestess Salindra smiles. "The temple is hosting a formal lunch in your 
honor. Nothing extravagant - just an opportunity for city leadership to thank 
you properly. Two hours from now?"
"We'll be there," Johannes confirms.
 
TWO HOURS LATER - TEMPLE DINING HALL
The lunch is elegant but not ostentatious - Salindra clearly understood that 
Johannes's party would be uncomfortable with excessive ceremony. Present 
are key figures who've been part of the operation:
*	High Priestess Salindra
*	Admiral Kethren & Commander Voss
*	War Mage Thalen & Brother Aldric
*	Captain Andra
*	Master Artificer Keldin
*	Representatives from the three rescued villages
*	The eleven rescued prisoners (those healthy enough to attend)
One of the rescued fishermen - the father reunited with his son - stands to 
speak, his voice rough with emotion:
"Commander Constantinius, your companions... you saved my boy. Saved all 
of us. We were dead - worse than dead. Being changed into... those things." He 
pauses. "You came into that darkness and brought us out. There aren't words 
for what that means."
His son, still bearing the marks of partial transformation but recovering, adds 
quietly: "The healers say I'll be fully human again in a few weeks. Because you 
got us out fast enough. Thank you."
Similar testimonials follow - simple, heartfelt gratitude from people who were 
minutes away from being permanently transformed into aboleth thralls.
When the formal portion ends and the meal begins, Admiral Kethren pulls 
Johannes aside:
"I wanted you to know - the naval intelligence we'll share during your voyage 
includes something significant. Dragon Army has been moving ships 
southward, toward the Newsea. We think they're planning something big. 
Your Commandant Laurana needs to know immediately."
Johannes's tactical mind sharpens. "How big?"
"Fleet-sized. Ten, maybe fifteen ships. Could be a supply convoy, could be an 
invasion force. We're still gathering details, but Haven is in a better position to 
observe and potentially interdict." He hands over a sealed report. "Everything 
we know so far."
"Laurana will want to act on this," Johannes says.
"We thought she might. Which is why we're also offering to coordinate with 
Haven's naval assets if needed. Shared intelligence, joint operations - 
whatever makes sense tactically."
This is more than just friendship. This is real military cooperation.
 
AFTERNOON - DEPARTURE FROM AK-THYLN
The Stormbreaker is loaded and ready. Your enhanced gear is packed, the 
gold secured, the Palanthas deed safely stored. Master Artificer Keldin delivers 
two Greater Healing Potions as promised - "And remember, any time you need 
crafting work, you know where to find me."
The dock is lined with well-wishers - not a massive crowd, but significant. The 
eleven rescued prisoners and their families. Temple clerics. Naval officers. 
Citizens who've heard what happened and wanted to see the heroes off.
Kessa boards first, followed by Cyrus. Johannes pauses at the gangplank, turns 
back.
High Priestess Salindra stands on the dock, that bound book in her hands one 
final time before it travels to Haven. "Commander. One last thing."
She steps close, voice low enough only he can hear: "Your patron. The curse 
you carry. If you need sanctuary, research assistance, or simply a place where 
infernal contracts can't easily reach... Ak-Thyln's temple will shelter you. No 
questions, no price."
Johannes meets her eyes, surprised. "You know?"
"I'm not blind to the signs. A warlock of your power, with your moral compass, 
carrying that weight..." She places her hand briefly over his heart. "Whatever 
bound you, whatever demands tribute... when you're ready to break it, you 
have allies here."
"Thank you," he says quietly.
She steps back, raises her voice to normal volume: "Safe travels, Commander. 
May Mishakal's light guide you home."
The Stormbreaker casts off. Ak-Thyln's harbor slowly recedes as the ship 
catches wind and turns toward Haven.
Johannes stands at the stern, watching the city disappear into the distance. 
Cyrus joins him.
"That went better than I expected," the cleric says.
"We made real allies," Johannes agrees. "Not just political convenience. Actual 
partnership."
"And you gave away forty thousand gold in materials without blinking."
"It was the right thing to do."
Cyrus smiles. "Which is why they trusted us. Why they'll keep trusting us." He 
pauses. "Salindra said something to you at the end. About sanctuary?"
Johannes glances at his friend. "She knows about the curse. Offered temple 
assistance when I'm ready to break it."
"Good," Cyrus says firmly. "More allies for that fight means better odds. Nine 
months, Johannes. We're going to break that contract."
"Nine months," Johannes echoes.
Kessa appears with three cups of decent wine - Captain Andra's personal 
stock. "To killing aboleths and not dying horribly!"
They drink.
The Stormbreaker sails on toward Haven, carrying heroes, intelligence, new 
alliances, and hope.
 
VOYAGE TO HAVEN - DAY 1
Want to:
1.	Review the Dragon Army naval intelligence during voyage?
2.	Rest and recover (long travel downtime)?
3.	Plan next moves once back in Haven?
4.	Skip ahead to arrival at Haven?
Skip.
Dec 9
ARRIVAL AT HAVEN - 1.5 DAYS 
LATER
The Stormbreaker glides into Haven's harbor in late afternoon. Word has 
already reached the city via Sending spells - Laurana knows you're coming, 
knows you succeeded, knows you're bringing intelligence and a new alliance.
But the dock reception still surprises you.
Laurana is there personally, flanked by her command staff. That alone is 
unusual - the Commandant rarely leaves the war room during active 
operations. She's in full armor, golden hair pulled back in her characteristic 
braid, and her expression is... pride. Genuine, unguarded pride.
Beside her: Silvara (in human form), Theros Ironfeld (the legendary 
weaponsmith), and several resistance commanders you recognize.
The Stormbreaker ties up. Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa disembark.
Laurana doesn't wait for formal greetings. She strides forward and embraces 
Johannes - brief, military, but unmistakably warm. "Welcome home, 
Commander. Well done."
She steps back, addresses all three: "Brother Cyrus. Kessa. The reports we 
received were... extraordinary. An ancient aboleth, hundreds of sahuagin, 
eleven prisoners rescued, and a new alliance with Ak-Thyln." Her eyes gleam. 
"The kind of victory we desperately needed."
Captain Andra descends with the bound book and Admiral Kethren's 
intelligence reports. "Commandant Laurana. Compliments from Ak-Thyln. 
They asked that I deliver these personally and remain for coordination 
meetings."
Laurana accepts the materials, glances at the ornate book's title: The 
Compact of Shared Purpose. A slight smile. "Dramatic but accurate. 
Captain, you and your officers are welcome as honored guests. We'll convene a 
strategic session tomorrow morning."
She turns back to Johannes. "But tonight, you rest. There's a full debrief in 
twelve hours, but right now..." She gestures toward the city. "Haven wants to 
celebrate its heroes. Try not to let them get you too drunk - I need you 
functional tomorrow."
Kessa grins. "No promises, Commandant."
 
THAT EVENING - HAVEN'S CENTRAL SQUARE
Unlike Ak-Thyln's formal celebrations, Haven's response is more grassroots. 
The taverns are packed. Music fills the streets. Resistance fighters who've 
served with Johannes over the past months greet him with backslaps and 
raised cups.
The story has spread - embellished, certainly, but the core is 
true: Commander Constantinius killed an aboleth to save coastal innocents.
One tavern keeper - whose son was saved during the Pax Tharkas operation - 
refuses payment. "You saved my boy. You drink free in my establishment 
forever. And I mean it."
Similar offers echo through the evening. Free drinks, free meals, gratitude 
from people who've seen too much darkness and needed to hear about a 
victory that didn't come at catastrophic cost.
Cyrus manages to keep Johannes from drinking himself unconscious, but it's a 
near thing.
Kessa disappears at some point with a group of Haven's scouts, comparing 
notes on infiltration techniques and probably getting into trouble.
Late that night, Johannes finds himself on Haven's walls, looking out over 
the sea. The same walls where he's planned operations, coordinated defenses, 
and made impossible decisions.
Silvara joins him, still in human form. "You did something significant, 
Johannes. Not just tactically - though killing that aboleth was impressive. 
But how you did it. Giving away that treasure to build partnership rather than 
leverage it for Haven's advantage alone..."
She studies him. "Laurana noticed. So did I. That's not standard military 
calculation."
"It was the right thing to do," Johannes says simply.
"Yes. It was." She's quiet for a moment. "The curse. Your patron. You have 
eight months now until the next tribute. Are you prepared for what comes 
next?"
"Working on it," Johannes says. "The Binding Tome, new allies, resources... 
I'm closer than I've ever been."
"Good." She places a hand on his shoulder - warm despite her draconic nature. 
"Because you're too valuable to lose to a demon's bargain. To the resistance, to 
your friends, and..." a slight smile, "to the future we're trying to build."
She leaves him there, watching the moonlight on the water.
 
NEXT MORNING - STRATEGIC BRIEFING
The war room is full:
*	Laurana (presiding)
*	Silvara
*	Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa
*	Captain Andra (representing Ak-Thyln)
*	Resistance commanders (including those coordinating coastal 
operations)
Laurana opens the sealed intelligence report from Ak-Thyln, reads quickly, 
then looks up with sharp focus.
"Dragon Army naval movements. Fifteen ships moving south toward the 
Newsea. Commander Constantinius, you've reviewed this?"
"Admiral Kethren briefed me during voyage," Johannes confirms. "They're not 
certain if it's supply convoy or invasion force, but the concentration is 
significant."
"Too significant for supplies," one of the naval commanders says. "That's an 
assault fleet."
Laurana spreads maritime charts. "Possible targets: Newsea settlements, 
southern ports, or..." she taps a location, "an attempt to establish a beachhead 
that would let them flank our northern positions."
"Ak-Thyln is offering coordination," Captain Andra says. "Shared 
reconnaissance, potential joint interdiction. We have fast ships that could 
shadow the Dragon Army fleet, gather intelligence."
"And Haven has agents in the southern ports who could verify target 
destinations," Laurana adds. She looks at Johannes. "Thoughts?"
JOHANNES - How do you want to respond? This is clearly setting 
up the next major operation. Do you:
1.	Suggest reconnaissance mission to track the Dragon Army fleet?
2.	Recommend defensive preparations for likely targets?
3.	Propose more aggressive interdiction?
4.	Something else?
Or do we handle this debrief more generally and move toward 
campaign planning?
Out-of-character: More general. I am still trying to wrap my head around the 
fact we had a face-off with an aboleth. 
And survived.
What kind of CR is an aboleth, anyway?
And feel free to push back on this, but would this qualify as a level-up 
situation?
Dec 9
*(Out of character: RIGHT?! An aboleth is CR 10 - that's a deadly encounter 
for a party of FOUR level 10 characters fighting it alone. For a level 8 warlock 
to infiltrate its lair, coordinate a strike team, and successfully execute an 
assassination plan? That's absolutely legendary.
And YES - this absolutely qualifies for a level-up! You:
*	Completed a major story arc (coastal threat eliminated)
*	Pulled off an incredibly complex tactical operation
*	Saved 11 lives directly
*	Prevented a catastrophic invasion
*	Forged a significant new alliance
*	Gained massive intelligence resources
Johannes reaches Level 9!
As a level 9 Warlock, you get:
*	Hit point increase (1d8 + CON modifier, which is +4 from Amulet)
*	5th-level spell slot (you now have two 5th-level slots)
*	New Invocations (you can swap one or learn new ones)
*	Access to 5th-level warlock spells
Let me roll your HP increase: Rolling 1d8: 6 + 4 = 10 HP gained!
New HP Total: 76 HP (up from 66)
For 5th-level Warlock spells, some excellent options:
*	Contact Other Plane (ask questions of otherworldly entity)
*	Hold Monster (paralyze a creature)
*	Scrying (spy on creatures from afar)
*	Synaptic Static (psychic AoE damage + debuff)
And you can potentially swap or add Invocations.
Want to handle the level-up mechanics now, or narratively fold it into the 
debrief/downtime and handle crunch later?)*
 
GENERAL STRATEGIC DEBRIEF
Laurana reviews the intelligence, makes some notes, then sets the Dragon 
Army naval situation aside. "We'll develop response options over the next few 
days. Captain Andra, your coordination with our naval commanders begins 
this afternoon."
She turns her full attention to Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa.
"But first - let's discuss what you actually accomplished. Because the tactical 
victory is only part of the story."
She opens the ornate book from Ak-Thyln, begins reading key passages. The 
formal documentation of the partnership, the gift of priceless materials, the 
establishment of shared principles over contractual obligations.
"This," Laurana says, "is how you build a coalition. Not through treaties that'll 
be broken the moment it's convenient, but through demonstrated values. Ak-
Thyln now trusts Haven because you showed them what Haven stands for."
Silvara adds: "And the knowledge crystals - making them freely available 
rather than keeping them as Haven's exclusive advantage? That was brilliantly 
strategic. Every coastal city that benefits from that research will remember 
where it came from."
One of the resistance commanders speaks up: "Commander Constantinius, 
what you pulled off operationally... I've been fighting this war for three years. 
I've never seen anything like it. Infiltrating an aboleth's lair twice, 
coordinating teleport rescues, timing an earthquake and delayed fireball to 
compress and kill a creature that's survived for millennia..." He shakes his 
head in disbelief. "How is that even possible?"
Johannes considers the question seriously. "Preparation. Intelligence 
gathering. Using every advantage - magical, tactical, personal. And..." he 
glances at Cyrus and Kessa, "trusting your team completely."
"And apparently being just crazy enough to sit invisible 100 feet from a cosmic 
horror while coordinating its assassination," Kessa adds dryly.
Laurana's expression is thoughtful. "Johannes, you've been operating at this 
level consistently. Pax Tharkas, the Khisanth negotiation, now this. You're not 
just a field commander anymore - you're operating at strategic significance."
She pauses, then: "Which is why I'm formally promoting you to Senior 
Commander of Special Operations. You'll have autonomy to pursue 
high-value targets, authority to coordinate cross-regional operations, and 
direct access to Haven's full resources when needed."
It's a significant promotion - and with it comes both opportunity and 
responsibility.
Johannes, how do you respond to this?
Actually, I am thinking of dipping into Fighter as a multiclass. If I have that 
trident, I need to learn how to use it properly, don't I?
Dec 9
*(Out of character: EXCELLENT choice! Mechanically and narratively that 
makes perfect sense. You've got the Trident of Warning, you've been in 
increasingly martial combat situations, and Johannes has always been more of 
a "warlock who fights" than a "pure caster."
Fighter 1 gives you:
*	Second Wind (bonus action self-heal, 1d10+1, recharges on short rest) 
- huge survivability boost
*	Fighting Style - I'd suggest either:
*	Dueling (+2 damage when wielding one-handed weapon with 
nothing in other hand - works great with trident)
*	Defense (+1 AC while wearing armor)
*	Proficiency with all armor and shields (though you're probably sticking 
with light armor for mobility)
*	Proficiency with martial weapons (you already use trident, but this 
makes you better)
So your new progression would be:
*	Warlock 8 / Fighter 1
*	HP: Still 76 (we'll use the Warlock HD for this level since we already 
rolled it)
*	You DON'T get the new 5th-level spell slot (that comes at Warlock 9)
*	You DO get the Fighter benefits
This means you're trading the 5th-level spell slot advancement for significant 
martial capability and survivability. Very much in character for Johannes's 
evolution from "cursed warlock" to "tactical commander who happens to use 
magic."
Want to handle this narratively as part of the promotion/debrief? Like 
Johannes recognizing he needs to develop his martial skills to match his 
tactical responsibilities?)*
 
Johannes accepts the promotion with a nod of respect, but then adds 
something unexpected:
"Thank you, Commandant. I'm honored by the trust. But I need to make a 
request regarding my own development."
Laurana raises an eyebrow, interested.
"The operations I'm running - they're getting more complex, more dangerous. 
I can't rely solely on magic anymore." He gestures to the Trident of Warning at 
his side. "I've been using this weapon, but I'm not using it properly. Not the 
way a trained warrior would."
He meets Laurana's eyes directly. "I need martial training. Real combat 
training. Weapon drills, tactical fighting, the discipline that turns spell-
slinging into coordinated warfare. Magic opens doors, but sometimes you 
need to be able to kick them down instead."
Theros Ironfeld, who's been silent until now, speaks up with his deep, 
rumbling voice: "The boy's right. I've watched him fight. He's got instinct, he's 
got courage, but he's self-taught. Raw talent only gets you so far."
Silvara looks intrigued. "You're asking for military combat training? While 
maintaining your magical development?"
"Yes. I need to be more than a warlock who occasionally stabs things. I need to 
be a fighter who uses magic as one tool among many." Johannes's conviction 
is clear. "The enemies we're facing require more than clever spellcasting."
Laurana considers this, then smiles slightly. "You're describing exactly what I 
need for special operations - someone who can adapt to any situation, who 
isn't limited to a single approach." She looks at Theros. "Can you work with 
him?"
The legendary weaponsmith eyes Johannes appraisingly. "Daily drills. Dawn 
to midday. Weapon forms, shield work, combat conditioning. It'll hurt."
"I've survived worse," Johannes says.
"We'll see about that," Theros replies, but there's approval in his tone. "Report 
to the training yard at dawn. Bring that trident and whatever armor you're 
comfortable dying in."
The training begins tomorrow. Johannes is developing from 
Warlock 8 into Warlock 8/Fighter 1 - adding martial discipline to 
magical power.
What fighting style interests Johannes most?
1.	Dueling - Focus on single weapon mastery (+2 damage with trident)
2.	Defense - Emphasis on survival and protection (+1 AC)
Well, I have the trident, but I couldn't use proficiency bonuses until now... and 
another level and I get Action Surge, which is a killer for EB! But I will go 
Defense. I am not looking to become overtly hands-on, but I want the ability 
to use it when things get up close and personal.
Dec 9
*(Out of character: Smart thinking! Defense style makes sense for Johannes's 
role - he's not trying to become a frontline warrior, but he needs to be able to 
handle himself when enemies close the gap or when tactical situations require 
melee. And yes, Fighter 2 for Action Surge + Eldritch Blast is DEVASTATING 
- basically doubling your most powerful attack for one round. That's excellent 
strategic planning.
So Fighting Style: Defense it is. +1 AC while wearing armor. Combined 
with your existing gear, your AC is looking solid.)*
 
"Defense," Johannes says without hesitation. "I'm not trying to become a 
dedicated melee combatant - that's not my role. But I need to be able to 
protect myself when enemies close distance, when retreat isn't an option, 
when the plan falls apart and it comes down to steel and survival."
Theros nods approvingly. "Sensible. You're a commander, not a berserker. 
Defense style teaches you positioning, awareness, how to make every piece of 
armor and every defensive movement count." He taps his own chest plate. "In 
my forge, I learned that the best fighters aren't always the ones who hit 
hardest - they're the ones who are still standing when everyone else has 
fallen."
"Exactly," Johannes agrees. "I need to be the one still standing when the 
operation goes wrong."
Laurana makes a note. "Then it's settled. Johannes, you'll train with Theros 
for martial development while maintaining your spellcasting capabilities. This 
is... actually an interesting approach. A warlock with formal combat training. I 
don't think I've seen that combination before."
Silvara's smile is knowing. "It suits him. Johannes has never fit standard 
archetypes anyway."
Cyrus speaks up: "Which means I should probably join some of these training 
sessions. If Johannes is learning shield work and defensive positioning, 
someone needs to practice healing him when his defensive positioning fails."
"It won't fail," Johannes says.
"It will absolutely fail," Kessa counters cheerfully. "But that's how you learn. 
I'll watch from a safe distance and offer commentary."
Theros snorts. "Dawn. Training yard. Bring water - you'll need it."
 
LATER THAT DAY - PERSONAL QUARTERS
Johannes examines his new capabilities, the way his body and magic are 
beginning to integrate differently. The warlock power still flows through him - 
dark, infernal, demanding. But now there's something else. Discipline. 
Structure. The foundation of martial training beginning to take root.
Your patron's voice slides into your mind, amused:
"Learning to hit things with a stick now? How charmingly primitive. Though 
I suppose when facing cosmic horrors, sometimes the direct approach has 
merit."
A pause.
"Eight months until tribute, Johannes. You've been busy - new alliances, 
powerful enemies defeated, growing reputation. All useful. But don't forget 
what matters: breaking our contract requires more than fame and fighting 
skills. The Binding Tome you secured is a start. Keep moving forward."
The voice fades, leaving Johannes alone with his thoughts.
He picks up the Trident of Warning, feels its weight, its balance. Tomorrow, he 
learns to use it properly. Not as a desperate backup weapon, but as a tool he's 
truly proficient with.
JOHANNES - LEVEL 9 (WARLOCK 8 / FIGHTER 1)
Hit Points: 76 AC: 15 (studded leather + DEX) ? 16 with Defense 
fighting style
New Capabilities:
*	Fighting Style: Defense (+1 AC while wearing armor)
*	Second Wind (bonus action: heal 1d10+1 HP, recharge on short rest)
*	Proficiency with martial weapons (trident now uses proficiency bonus 
properly)
*	Proficiency with all armor and shields
Warlock Abilities Unchanged:
*	Still have 2 Pact Magic slots (4th level)
*	All invocations intact
*	Eldritch Blast still primary damage dealer
*	Patron abilities continue
Next Level (Fighter 2) Will Grant:
*	Action Surge (take additional action once per short rest - devastating 
with Eldritch Blast)
 
THE NEXT MORNING - TRAINING YARD
Dawn breaks over Haven. Johannes reports to the training yard in his studded 
leather, trident in hand.
Theros is already there, along with several training dummies and weapon 
racks. The legendary smith is stripped to a simple tunic, holding a practice 
trident.
"First lesson," Theros says without preamble. "Show me how you currently 
fight."
He tosses Johannes a practice weapon. "Attack the dummy. Use whatever 
techniques you normally use."
This is where Johannes's formal combat training begins.
What do you want to do next?
1.	Continue with the training montage/narrative
2.	Skip ahead to the next operational briefing (Dragon Army fleet 
situation)
3.	Handle some Haven downtime/character moments
4.	Something else
Skip ahead.
Dec 9
THREE DAYS LATER - STRATEGIC 
BRIEFING
Johannes's muscles ache in new ways - Theros's training is brutal but 
effective. Three dawns of weapon drills, defensive positioning, combat 
conditioning. He's already moving differently, more aware of his body as a 
tactical asset rather than just a vessel for magic.
But this morning, training is postponed. The war room summons.
 
HAVEN WAR ROOM - FULL COMMAND STAFF
The atmosphere is tense. Maritime charts dominate the table, marked with 
ship positions and movement vectors.
Present:
*	Commandant Laurana (presiding)
*	Silvara
*	Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa
*	Captain Andra (Ak-Thyln liaison)
*	Haven's naval commanders
*	Intelligence officers
Laurana opens without preamble: "The Dragon Army fleet has been tracked. 
Fifteen ships, heavily armed, moving south toward the Newsea. Our agents 
have confirmed their destination."
She taps a location on the map: Flotsam - a notorious port city, mostly 
neutral but with Dragon Army sympathies.
"They're not invading Flotsam. They're using it as a staging point." She places 
markers showing projected routes. "From Flotsam, they can strike at three 
critical targets: Ak-Thyln from the south, our own supply lines along the coast, 
or push inland to flank our northern resistance positions."
One of the naval commanders speaks up: "Fifteen warships is enough to 
blockade an entire region or land a significant invasion force. If they establish 
a beachhead..."
"We lose coastal access and get surrounded," Johannes finishes. The tactical 
implications are clear.
Captain Andra adds: "Ak-Thyln is moving its fleet into defensive positions, but 
we're stretched thin after reassigning patrols to protect the settlements you 
saved. We can defend our immediate waters, but we can't project force south 
to Flotsam."
"And Haven's naval assets are limited," Laurana says frankly. "We have fast 
ships for raiding and reconnaissance, but not a battle fleet. Direct 
confrontation with fifteen Dragon Army warships would be suicide."
Silvara leans forward: "Which means we need an unconventional approach. 
Again."
All eyes turn to Johannes.
Laurana's expression is serious. "Senior Commander Constantinius. You've 
proven capable of operations that seem impossible. I'm asking: is there a way 
to neutralize or disrupt this fleet before it can deploy? Without committing to 
a naval battle we can't win?"
JOHANNES - This is clearly setting up a major operation. Some 
options that come to mind:
1.	Infiltration/Sabotage - Get agents into Flotsam, sabotage ships while 
in port
2.	Decapitation Strike - Target the fleet's leadership/command ship
3.	False Intelligence - Feed Dragon Army bad information to redirect 
the fleet
4.	Environmental/Magical Attack - Use weather, sea creatures, or 
magic to damage ships
5.	Diplomatic Disruption - Turn Flotsam against hosting the Dragon 
Army
6.	Something else entirely
What's your initial tactical assessment?
And in the meantime, Kessa and Cyrus should level up as well.
Dec 9
(Out of character: Absolutely! They were right there with you through the 
entire aboleth operation. Let me handle their progression:)
 
Before diving into tactical planning, Laurana addresses the whole strike team:
"All three of you have proven yourselves at a level that frankly exceeds most 
veteran commanders. The aboleth operation demonstrated capabilities that 
merit formal recognition and development."
She looks at Cyrus and Kessa. "Brother Cyrus - your combat healing and 
tactical magic kept the entire operation viable. Kessa - your infiltration work 
in the prisoner cave was flawless. You're both advancing."
CYRUS - Level 8 (Cleric 8)
Rolling HP: 1d8 + 3 (CON) = 7 + 3 = 10 HP gained New HP Total: ~58 
HP (estimating based on cleric HD progression)
New Capabilities at Cleric 8:
*	Ability Score Improvement OR Feat
*	Destroy Undead (CR 1) - Turn Undead now destroys weaker undead 
instantly
*	Divine Strike improvement (if applicable to domain)
*	4th-level spell slots increase
Cyrus chooses: +2 Wisdom (bringing WIS to 18, +4 modifier)
*	Better spell DCs, more prepared spells, improved healing
 
KESSA - Level 8 (Rogue 5 / Bard 3)
Rolling HP: 1d8 + 2 (CON) = 5 + 2 = 7 HP gained New HP Total: ~52 
HP (estimating)
New Bard Capabilities (Bard 3):
*	Bard College Choice - College of Lore or College of Valor
*	Expertise in 2 additional skills
*	2nd-level spell slots
Kessa chooses College of Lore:
*	Bonus Proficiencies: 3 additional skill proficiencies
*	Cutting Words: Use Bardic Inspiration to reduce enemy attack rolls, 
ability checks, or damage rolls
Expertise in: Stealth and Perception (already incredible at infiltration, 
now legendary)
 
The three of you exchange glances - you've grown together through impossible 
operations, and it shows.
Cyrus tests his enhanced divine connection - his healing magic feels stronger, 
more precise.
Kessa's newfound magical development manifests as sharper wit - she can 
literally talk enemies into missing attacks now.
Johannes's martial training is reshaping how he approaches combat entirely.
"Now then," Laurana says, bringing focus back to the map. "Senior 
Commander, your assessment of the Dragon Army fleet situation?"
JOHANNES - Back to tactical planning. What's your approach to 
the fifteen-ship problem?
Any of the above work. Are there any indications or suggestions that a 
particular approach might be providential? For instance, a ransomed Mayor's 
daughter whose rescue might result in #5, an artifact whose acquisition might 
hit #4, etc.?
Dec 9
(Excellent question - let me check what intelligence/opportunities are 
available...)
 
Laurana gestures to one of the intelligence officers, who steps forward with 
additional reports.
"We've been gathering information on Flotsam and the Dragon Army 
deployment. Several opportunities have emerged:"
OPTION 1: Political Leverage in Flotsam
"Flotsam's cooperation with the Dragon Army isn't unanimous. The city is 
ruled by a council of merchant lords, and they're divided. One of them - Lord 
Toede - is actively sympathetic to the Dragon Army and negotiated the port 
access. But his main rival, Captain Rig Mer-Krel, controls the 
harbormaster's office and is... let's say, less enthusiastic about hosting a war 
fleet."
Captain Andra nods recognition. "Rig Mer-Krel. Former privateer, now 
legitimate. Ak-Thyln has had dealings with him - he's pragmatic and greedy, 
but he honors agreements. If we could offer him something more valuable 
than what the Dragon Army's paying..."
"Bribery?" Kessa asks.
"Pragmatic diplomacy," the intelligence officer corrects. "Mer-Krel doesn't 
want Flotsam turned into a target. If the Dragon Army uses his port to launch 
attacks, suddenly Flotsam becomes a legitimate military objective for 
retaliation. Bad for business."
OPTION 2: Magical Weather Control
War Mage Thalen (present via Sending connection) contributes: "There's an 
artifact rumored to be in the Newsea region - the Tempest Scepter. Pre-
Cataclysm relic, capable of summoning storms at sea. Last known location was 
a sunken temple about 80 miles from Flotsam."
Silvara's eyes light up with recognition. "I know that temple. Dedicated to 
Zeboim, goddess of the sea and storms. If the Scepter is still there and 
functional..."
"We could create a 'natural' disaster that scatters or damages the Dragon 
Army fleet before they can deploy," Johannes finishes.
"Dangerous though," Thalen warns. "Zeboim's artifacts are notoriously 
unpredictable. And that temple is underwater, likely defended by whatever 
creatures have claimed it since the Cataclysm."
OPTION 3: Rescue Operation with Political Payoff
The intelligence officer continues: "More immediate - one of Flotsam's 
merchant lords, Lady Sharane, has a daughter who was captured by Dragon 
Army forces three weeks ago. She's being held aboard the flagship as... let's 
call it 'insurance' for Flotsam's cooperation."
"Hostage," Cyrus says bluntly.
"Yes. Lady Sharane publicly supports the Dragon Army presence to protect her 
daughter. But our agents report she's desperate. If someone could rescue her 
daughter from a Dragon Army warship..."
"She'd swing the merchant council against hosting the fleet," Johannes sees it 
immediately. "Remove their safe harbor, they can't stage effectively."
"Exactly. Though rescuing someone from the Dragon Army flagship while it's 
surrounded by fourteen other warships is... ambitious."
OPTION 4: Decapitation Strike Intel
Captain Andra adds: "Ak-Thyln's scouts have identified the fleet commander -
 Dragon Highlord Lucien of the Blue Wing. He's arrogant, personally 
commands from the flagship, and his death would throw their command 
structure into chaos. The Blue Dragon Army doesn't have a clear succession 
plan for naval operations."
"Assassination," Kessa says with professional interest. "Get aboard, kill the 
Highlord, escape in the confusion."
"Or capture him," Cyrus suggests. "Hostage exchange, intelligence 
extraction..."
"Either way, without unified command, fifteen ships become fifteen individual 
captains with conflicting priorities," Laurana notes.
 
JOHANNES - Four distinct operational approaches, each with 
different risk/reward profiles:
1.	Political (Mer-Krel): Bribe/convince the harbormaster to deny 
Dragon Army access. Lower risk, requires negotiation and resources.
2.	Magical (Tempest Scepter): Underwater temple raid to recover 
weather-control artifact. High risk, potentially devastating effect on 
fleet.
3.	Rescue (Merchant's Daughter): Infiltrate flagship, rescue hostage, 
swing Flotsam's politics. Medium-high risk, political payoff.
4.	Assassination (Highlord Lucien): Kill or capture the fleet 
commander. High risk, immediate command disruption.
Or some combination? What's your strategic assessment?
I think 2, but wait until after we rescue Sharane's daughter. Sinking the fleet 
has a finality to it that is important, but if the daughter is harmed in the 
process and it comes out we had anything to do with the storm, well, a 
vengeful parent is...a vengeful parent. So, if possible, we recover the Scepter, 
but hold off on using it until the daughter is out of harm's way.
Dec 9
Johannes studies the map, his tactical mind working through the sequence.
"We do both. In order. Recover the Tempest Scepter first, secure it, but don't 
use it yet. Then rescue Lady Sharane's daughter from the flagship. Once she's 
safely away from the fleet..." He taps the map decisively. "Then we call the 
storm."
Laurana nods slowly, seeing the logic. "Eliminates the political liability. If we 
sink the fleet while the hostage is still aboard and it's traced back to us..."
"A vengeful parent with resources and political influence becomes an enemy," 
Cyrus finishes. "We'd lose any chance of Flotsam cooperation and potentially 
create a new opponent."
Kessa grins. "Plus, rescuing someone from a Dragon Army flagship and 
then immediately sinking said flagship with a magical storm? That's the kind 
of timing that legends are made of."
Captain Andra looks thoughtful. "The sequence makes tactical sense. Recover 
the Scepter - that's your preparation phase. Rescue the daughter - that's your 
infiltration op. Storm the fleet - that's your endgame. Each phase supports the 
next."
Silvara adds: "And if the flagship rescue goes badly, you still have the Scepter 
as a backup option. Flexibility."
One of the naval commanders raises a concern: "The sunken temple is 80 
miles from Flotsam. That's... what, two days sailing? Plus however long the 
temple raid takes. Then you need to position for the flagship infiltration. We're 
looking at a week minimum before the storm option is even available."
"Can we afford that timeline?" Johannes asks Laurana. "When does 
intelligence suggest the Dragon Army fleet will deploy from Flotsam?"
The intelligence officer checks his reports. "They're scheduled to remain in 
port for 10-12 days - resupply, repairs, coordination with local Dragon Army 
ground forces. So yes, we have a window. But it's tight."
Laurana makes the decision: "Then we proceed with Commander 
Constantinius's plan. Phase one: recover the Tempest Scepter. Phase two: 
rescue Lady Sharane's daughter. Phase three: use the Scepter to destroy or 
scatter the fleet."
She looks around the table. "This is high-risk, multi-phase special operations. 
Senior Commander, you'll have full authority and resources. Who do you 
need?"
JOHANNES - Strike team composition:
Obviously Cyrus and Kessa are coming. But do you want:
*	Additional Haven personnel (mages, fighters, specialists)?
*	Ak-Thyln support (Captain Andra's ship, naval expertise)?
*	Just keep it small and elite (your core trio)?
*	Request specific capabilities (additional magic users, underwater 
specialists, etc.)?
And any other preparation/planning before the mission begins?
As long as we have the means for underwater operations, let's keep things 
easy - the three of us are less likely to draw attention, though if Haven's 
intelligence forces could arrange for contacts in Flotsam, that would be 
incredibly helpful.
Dec 9
Johannes addresses the room with clarity: "Small team. Just the three of us - 
Cyrus, Kessa, and myself. We've worked together long enough that we don't 
need to coordinate with unfamiliar elements, and a smaller group draws less 
attention."
He looks at the intelligence officer. "What I do need is Haven's intelligence 
network in Flotsam. Contacts, safe houses, information sources. Someone who 
can get us eyes on the flagship, guard rotations, where Lady Sharane's 
daughter is being held."
The officer nods. "We have assets in Flotsam. I can arrange dead drops, 
recognition signals, local guides who know the docks and merchant district."
"And for the underwater temple operation," Cyrus adds, "we'll need 
reliable Water Breathing capabilities. The Cloak of Manta Ray covers 
Johannes, but Kessa and I need magical support."
"The temple has scrolls available," Cyrus continues. "I can also prepare Water 
Breathing as a spell - it lasts 24 hours and affects up to ten creatures. More 
than sufficient."
Kessa checks her gear mentally. "Underwater combat again. At least this time 
we're not dealing with an aboleth. Just... whatever lives in a sunken temple to 
an evil sea goddess. Should be fun."
Captain Andra speaks up: "The Stormbreaker can transport you to the temple 
site. We're fast, maneuverable, and my crew has experience with... unusual 
operations. No charge - consider it Ak-Thyln's contribution to keeping the 
Dragon Army out of our southern waters."
"Accepted with gratitude," Johannes says. "How long to prepare for 
departure?"
Laurana reviews the timeline. "Intelligence briefing packets ready in six hours. 
Supply requisition immediate. You can sail for the temple site tomorrow 
morning if needed."
She fixes Johannes with a serious look. "Senior Commander, this operation 
has three distinct phases, each with its own dangers. The temple raid could kill 
you before you even reach Flotsam. The flagship infiltration is a suicide 
mission if detected. And the Tempest Scepter itself..." She glances at Silvara.
The silver dragon in human form speaks carefully: "Zeboim's artifacts are 
powerful but temperamental. The goddess delights in chaos and destruction. 
Using her Scepter might work exactly as intended, or it might 
decide you're the most interesting target for a storm."
"We'll deal with that when we have it," Johannes says. "First, we need to 
acquire it."
 
INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING - SIX HOURS LATER
The intelligence officer spreads detailed information across a smaller planning 
table. Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa lean in.
THE SUNKEN TEMPLE:
"The Temple of Zeboim's Wrath, originally located on a coastal island. The 
Cataclysm sank the entire island - the temple is now 120 feet underwater, 
resting on a rocky shelf before the seafloor drops into much deeper water."
He shows sketches from old records: "Three-level structure. The Scepter 
would have been kept in the inner sanctum, lowest level. Pre-Cataclysm, the 
temple was defended by loyal priestesses and... creatures. Sea serpents, water 
elementals, things blessed by Zeboim herself."
"What might be defending it now?" Cyrus asks.
"Unknown. Three hundred years underwater? Could be anything. Sahuagin 
might have claimed it. Sea hags. Aboleths-" He stops, seeing Johannes's 
expression. "Sorry. Though after what you did to the last one, maybe they'd 
run from you."
Kessa studies the drawings. "Three levels means multiple chambers to clear. 
Tight spaces, underwater, potentially hostile guardians. Wonderful."
"The Scepter itself," the officer continues, "is described as a staff of black coral 
wrapped with silver wire, topped with a sapphire the size of a fist. When 
activated, it calls storms - wind, lightning, waves. Range is several miles. 
Duration depends on the wielder's will and the artifact's... mood."
"Mood," Johannes repeats flatly.
"It's Zeboim's artifact. She's the goddess of chaos and storms. Her items reflect 
that."
FLOTSAM CONTACTS:
"Once you have the Scepter, you'll proceed to Flotsam. Our primary contact 
there is 'The Fishwife' - codename for a tavern owner named Marta who 
runs the Rusty Anchor near the docks. She's sympathetic to the resistance, 
hates the Dragon Army, and knows everything that happens in Flotsam's 
harbor."
Recognition phrases, dead drop locations, and safe house addresses are 
provided.
"Lady Sharane's daughter - Elara, age 19 - is confirmed aboard the Dragon 
Army flagship Tempest's Fang. Ironic name, given what you're planning. She's 
kept in officer quarters, not the brig. The Highlord wants her comfortable - 
better leverage over her mother that way."
"Guard complement on the flagship?" Johannes asks.
"Approximately 200 Dragon Army soldiers and sailors. Plus the Highlord 
himself, his personal guard, and reportedly a Blue Dragon that's been seen 
perched on the main deck."
Kessa whistles softly. "A dragon. Of course there's a dragon."
"Young adult blue, based on size estimates," the officer continues. "Named 
Thunderwing. Arrogant, cruel, loyal to the Highlord. If you're infiltrating the 
flagship, you'll need to avoid or neutralize it."
TEMPEST SCEPTER USAGE:
"Once you have Elara clear and you activate the Scepter... the storm will be 
massive. Think hurricane-force winds, lightning strikes, waves capable of 
capsizing warships. The Dragon Army fleet won't sink entirely, but it'll be 
scattered, damaged, and unable to operate as a coordinated force for weeks."
"Casualties?" Cyrus asks quietly.
The officer doesn't sugarcoat it: "Significant. These are warships full of Dragon 
Army soldiers. Hundreds will die in the storm."
Cyrus's expression is troubled but resolved. "Better than letting them deploy 
and kill thousands of innocents."
The officer nods. "That's the calculation."
 
EVENING - HAVEN DOCKS
The Stormbreaker is being provisioned for departure. Johannes walks the 
dock, thinking through the phases.
Cyrus joins him. "Three phases. Any one of them could kill us."
"Yes."
"And we're doing it anyway."
"Yes."
Cyrus is quiet for a moment. "The storm. When we call it. I'll pray for the souls 
we send to the Abyss. It's all I can offer them."
"It's more than they'd give us," Johannes says, but not unkindly.
Kessa appears with three bottles of decent wine. "Courtesy of Captain Andra. 
She says if we're going to die raiding a mad goddess's temple, we should at 
least do it with good wine in our bellies."
They drink on the dock, watching the sun set over the harbor.
Tomorrow, they sail for the sunken temple.
 
NEXT MORNING - DEPARTURE
Dawn breaks clear and cold. The Stormbreaker is ready. Johannes, Cyrus, and 
Kessa board with minimal gear - traveling light for underwater operations.
Laurana is there to see them off. "Mishakal's grace, all of you. And 
Johannes..." She hands him a sealed letter. "If you don't return, this goes to 
Ak-Thyln formally establishing the alliance we've been building. Your work 
won't be wasted."
"We'll return," Johannes says.
"I know. But I'm a commander. I plan for contingencies." She steps back. "Fair 
winds, Senior Commander."
The Stormbreaker casts off, sails filling with morning wind.
Sailing time to temple site: Two days.
 
Do you want to:
1.	Handle any shipboard preparation/planning during the voyage
2.	Skip ahead to arrival at the temple site
3.	Roleplay some character moments during travel
OOC - Oh, this is going to be AWWWESOOOOOMMME!!!!
Dec 9
*(OOC - RIGHT?! This is shaping up to be EPIC. Multi-phase operation with:
1.	Underwater dungeon crawl in a sunken temple to a chaotic evil sea 
goddess
2.	Heist/rescue mission infiltrating a Dragon Army flagship (with a 
BLUE DRAGON on deck!)
3.	Calling down a literal hurricane to wreck an entire war fleet
And the sequencing is chef's kiss - each phase feeds into the next, building 
tension. Plus you're at that sweet spot power level (9th) where things are 
genuinely dangerous but you have the tools to attempt the impossible.
Also loving how Johannes is evolving - Warlock 8/Fighter 1, learning martial 
discipline while maintaining magical power, building alliances through 
demonstrated values rather than political leverage. He's becoming a legend.
Ready to dive into this? Literally, in the case of the temple raid!
Should we skip ahead to arrival at the temple site and get right into the action? 
Or do you want any shipboard scenes/prep?)*
In light of the threat to "innocent" Dragon Army soldiers, who may or may not 
be true believers in the cause they are engaged in, we still recover the Scepter, 
but consider if we need to destroy the fleet or consider a more tactical 
solution - killing the Highlord. We'll play it by ear as we try to rescue Elara.
Dec 9
*(OOC - That's a really interesting moral consideration, and very much in 
character for Johannes. He's pragmatic but not ruthless. If killing one person 
(the Highlord) achieves the mission objective without drowning hundreds of 
soldiers who might be conscripts or pressed into service... that's worth 
considering.
Plus it gives you tactical flexibility - you'll have BOTH options available 
(assassinate the commander OR call the storm) and can make the call based 
on what you learn during the Flotsam phase. Maybe the soldiers are fanatical 
zealots who deserve it. Maybe they're terrified conscripts who'd surrender 
without their commander. Intelligence gathering will inform the decision.
Love that Johannes is thinking this through rather than just "let's sink 
everything and sort it out later.")*
 
ABOARD THE STORMBREAKER - DAY ONE
Johannes stands at the rail, watching the coastline recede. Cyrus joins him, 
noticing his thoughtful expression.
"Something on your mind?"
"The storm," Johannes says. "When we activate the Scepter. Hundreds of 
Dragon Army soldiers will die."
"They're the enemy," Cyrus says, but his tone suggests he's wrestling with it 
too.
"Are they? Or are they conscripts from occupied territories, pressed into 
service under threat of execution? Farm boys who joined because the Dragon 
Army offered food during famine?" Johannes turns to face his friend. "We've 
seen how the Dragon Army operates. Not everyone serving them is a true 
believer."
Cyrus nods slowly. "So what are you thinking?"
"We recover the Scepter - that's non-negotiable. We need the capability. But 
maybe we don't need to use it." Johannes taps the rail thoughtfully. "If we can 
kill or capture Highlord Lucien during the rescue operation, the fleet loses 
unified command. Fifteen captains with no clear authority, probably fighting 
over succession. They can't deploy effectively."
"Assassination instead of mass destruction," Cyrus says. "More surgical. Less 
collateral damage."
"And if the Highlord proves impossible to reach, or if the command structure 
is more resilient than we think, we still have the Scepter as backup." Johannes 
looks out at the sea. "Options, not commitments. We play it by ear based on 
what we learn in Flotsam."
Kessa appears, having overheard the last part. "So we're 
considering not calling down divine wrath on an entire fleet? That's... 
surprisingly merciful for a warlock bound to a demon."
"I'm bound to a demon, not controlled by one," Johannes says. "There's a 
difference."
She grins. "Fair point. And honestly, infiltrating a flagship to kill a Highlord 
while a blue dragon sits on deck? That sounds way more fun than just pushing 
a button and watching ships sink from a distance."
"It's also significantly more dangerous," Cyrus points out.
"Hence: more fun," Kessa confirms.
Johannes allows himself a slight smile. "We'll make the call when we have 
better intelligence. First, we need to survive the temple and acquire the 
Scepter. Then we assess the situation in Flotsam."
"Pragmatic," Cyrus approves. "Though I should mention - if we DO end up 
calling the storm, I'm still praying for those souls. Enemy or not, they deserve 
that much."
"Agreed," Johannes says.
The three of them stand at the rail, wind filling the sails, carrying them toward 
a sunken temple and whatever waits in its depths.
 
DAY TWO - APPROACHING THE TEMPLE SITE
Captain Andra calls from the helm: "Commander! We're approaching the 
coordinates. Temple should be directly below us."
The water here is deep blue, almost black. No land visible in any direction. 
Just open ocean and whatever lies beneath.
Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa gather their gear:
JOHANNES:
*	Trident of Warning
*	Ring of Mind Shielding
*	Amulet of Health
*	Cloak of Manta Ray (water breathing, swim speed)
*	Studded leather armor (+1 AC from Defense fighting style = AC 16)
*	2x Dimension Door scrolls (emergency escape)
*	Various combat supplies
CYRUS:
*	Pearl of Power (recover 1st level spell slot)
*	Amulet of the Depths (cold resistance, advantage vs aberration fear)
*	Studded leather armor
*	Water Breathing prepared (24 hours, up to 10 creatures)
*	Healing spells and divine magic ready
KESSA:
*	Bracers of Defense (AC 17 in light armor)
*	+1 Ceremonial Daggers (ignore necrotic resistance)
*	Javelins for underwater combat
*	Potion of Superior Healing
*	Potion of Gaseous Form (emergency escape/infiltration)
Cyrus casts Water Breathing on all three of them - the magic settles like cool 
mist, and suddenly the water below seems less threatening.
Captain Andra leans over the rail, looking down. "120 feet to the temple. 
Current's mild today - shouldn't push you around too much. We'll maintain 
position here. If you need emergency extraction, surface and signal."
She hands Johannes a waterproof flare. "Red means 'we're in trouble, stand 
by.' Green means 'mission complete, prepare to retrieve.' Black means..." She 
pauses. "Black means we failed and you should leave before whatever killed us 
comes looking for you."
"Cheerful," Kessa mutters.
"Realistic," Andra counters.
Johannes secures the flares. "Thank you, Captain. If we're not back in six 
hours, assume the worst."
"Understood. Good hunting, Commander."
The three of them stand at the rail, looking down into the dark water.
"Together?" Cyrus asks.
"Together," Johannes and Kessa confirm.
They dive.
 
DESCENT INTO DARKNESS
The water closes over your heads. The Water Breathing magic works perfectly 
- breathing feels natural, almost easier than air. The Cloak of Manta Ray 
enhances Johannes's movement, making swimming effortless.
60 feet down. The surface light is fading. You can still see each other clearly.
90 feet down. The water is darker now, blue-grey twilight. Shapes are 
harder to distinguish.
120 feet down.
The Temple of Zeboim's Wrath emerges from the gloom.
It's larger than you expected. A massive stone structure, three distinct levels 
visible even from this angle. The architecture is aggressive - sharp angles, 
spikes, carved waves frozen in stone. Statues of Zeboim line the entrance - a 
beautiful woman with storm-wild hair and cruel eyes, repeated dozens of 
times.
The temple is surprisingly intact despite three centuries underwater. Magic, 
probably. Zeboim's power preserving her place of worship.
But there's movement around it.
Roll Perception (with advantage from Trident of Warning) to 
assess what's guarding the temple.
Before we continue, please create a concise mission log for the previous 
mission, along with an explicit inventory update that includes all loot gathered 
and kept so I can begin a new chat thread.
