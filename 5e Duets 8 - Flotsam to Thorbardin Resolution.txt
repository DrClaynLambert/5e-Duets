I'll search the project knowledge for those mission logs to understand where 
we left off with the sahuagin threat and the scepter quest.

Perfect! I have all the context. You're at the sunken Temple of Zeboim, about 
to begin Phase 1 of the Dragon Army fleet operation-recovering the Tempest 
Scepter. Let me set the scene.
 
THE SUNKEN TEMPLE OF ZEBOIM
Phase 1: Artifact Recovery
The Stormbreaker rocks gently at anchor, positioned precisely above the 
coordinates Admiral Kethren provided. The water here is deeper than your 
coastal sahuagin mission-120 feet down-but clearer. Sunlight penetrates the 
first fifty feet, then fades to a murky twilight.
Captain Andra stands at the rail beside you, studying the water. "Temple's 
been down there about 280 years, since the Cataclysm. Zeboim's priests knew 
it was coming-sealed the inner sanctum before the city sank. That's why the 
Scepter survived." She glances at you. "Most artifacts of the gods were lost in 
the Cataclysm. Those that remain..." She doesn't finish, but the implication is 
clear: they're powerful, and they're dangerous.
Kessa checks her gear one more time-the +1 ceremonial daggers, her bracers, 
the harpoon. "So we're looking for a sealed sanctum inside a temple that's 
been underwater for three centuries. Should be in pristine condition, right?" 
Her tone is dry, but you catch the excitement beneath it.
Cyrus adjusts his holy symbol. "Zeboim is the goddess of storms, tempests, 
and the sea-temperamental, vengeful, but also... protective of those who 
respect her domain." He looks at the water with something like reverence. "If 
the Scepter is there, it will be guarded. By what, I cannot say."
Your equipment check:
*	Cloak of Manta Ray (swim 60 ft, water breathing-unlimited duration)
*	Trident of Warning (+1, advantage on initiative, party can't be 
surprised)
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (mental protection-important if there are 
aberrations down there)
*	2 Potions of Greater Healing (4d4+4)
*	1 Potion of Superior Healing (8d4+8)
*	1 Aboleth Mucus Vial (probably not relevant here, but you never know)
*	2 Dimension Door scrolls (emergency escape)
*	Signal flares (red/green/black)
Kessa has:
*	Bracers of Defense (AC 17)
*	Potion of Gaseous Form (emergency escape)
*	Potion of Superior Healing (8d4+8)
*	Her usual arsenal of daggers and weapons
Cyrus has:
*	Amulet of the Depths (swim speed, water breathing, cold resistance, 
speak with dead 1/day)
*	Pearl of Power (recover 1st-level slot)
*	His full complement of 4th-level spells
Captain Andra produces a sealed leather case. "Intelligence from the Ak-Thyln 
archives. What they know about the temple's layout." She hands it to you.
THE MAP (rough sketch):
*	Upper Plaza: Collapsed columns, open to water, former public 
worship area
*	Main Sanctuary: Large chamber, double doors (possibly sealed)
*	Inner Sanctum: Behind the sanctuary-this is where the Scepter 
should be
*	Side Chambers: Purpose unknown, possibly priest quarters or storage
*	Warnings: "Structural integrity questionable," "Guardian spirits 
reported," "Strong magical wards confirmed"
Captain Andra watches you review the information. "My crew will maintain 
position here. Signal flares if you need emergency extraction-red for trouble, 
green for success. If you send up black..." She pauses. "Black means you're not 
coming back. We'll know to leave."
The water looks calm. Deceptively so.
What's your approach?
1.	Descend as a group, stay together for safety
2.	Johannes scouts ahead using invisibility (One with Shadows), 
reports back
3.	Send Cyrus down first to assess spiritual/divine elements before 
committing
4.	Something else?
And do you want to buff before descending (Armor of Agathys, Hex 
prepared, etc.), or save spell slots until you know what you're dealing with?
Save slots, but have water breathing cast on Kessa, so they can follow me after 
I scout around first. Wait at around 80 feet down?
Dec 9
DESCENT TO THE TEMPLE
Cyrus nods and begins the ritual casting of Water Breathing. It takes ten 
minutes, his hands moving through precise gestures as divine energy 
coalesces. When he touches Kessa's shoulder, she gasps slightly-then grins.
"That's... weird. Good weird, but weird." She inhales deeply, testing the magic. 
"Okay, I can work with this."
"The spell lasts eight hours," Cyrus confirms. "More than sufficient for the 
operation."
You give final instructions: "I'll scout ahead using the cloak. Give me a twenty-
minute window-if I'm not back by then, assume something's wrong and be 
ready to adapt. Stay at eighty feet, keep watch for my signal."
Kessa checks her daggers one more time. "Eighty feet. Twenty minutes. Got 
it."
Cyrus clasps your shoulder briefly. "Mishakal's grace go with you, my friend."
 
THE DESCENT
You step off the Stormbreaker's rail and plunge into the clear blue water. The 
Cloak of Manta Ray activates instantly-you feel your body streamline, your 
breathing shift to drawing oxygen from the water itself. It's effortless, natural.
60 feet down: The sunlight is still strong here, but dimming. Schools of fish 
scatter at your approach. The water is surprisingly clear-visibility is good, 
maybe 60-70 feet in all directions.
80 feet down: The light has faded to twilight blue. You pause, looking up-
Kessa and Cyrus are visible as dark shapes against the brighter water above, 
treading water and waiting. Kessa waves. You wave back, then continue.
100 feet down: The twilight deepens. The water is cooler here. Your Cloak 
maintains comfortable temperature and breathing, but you feel the pressure of 
the depth psychologically if not physically.
120 feet down: The temple emerges from the gloom below you.
 
THE SUNKEN TEMPLE - FIRST SIGHT
It's more intact than you expected.
The structure is built from white marble-now stained with algae and 
encrusted with barnacles, but still recognizable as architecture. It must have 
been beautiful once. The roof has collapsed in places, letting water flow freely 
through the interior, but the main walls still stand.
What you see:
The Upper Plaza:
*	Broad stone platform, roughly 80 feet across
*	Collapsed columns forming a rough perimeter-some still upright, most 
fallen
*	A central pathway leads toward the main doors
*	Scattered debris: broken statues, overturned braziers, fallen stonework
*	Seaweed sways in the gentle current
*	Small fish dart between the ruins
The Main Doors:
*	Massive bronze doors, green with verdigris
*	Ornate reliefs showing storms, waves, ships
*	The doors are closed, but one hangs slightly askew on its hinges
*	Faint magical glow around the frame-wards, possibly
Movement: You immediately notice three shapes patrolling the plaza. 
They're humanoid but wrong-drowned ones, by the look of them. Undead 
sailors or priests, bloated and pale, drifting through the water with unnatural 
grace. They move in a pattern, circling the temple entrance.
Detail check (Perception): The drowned ones are armed-rusty weapons, 
but still dangerous. They don't seem particularly alert, but they're definitely on 
patrol. Corporeal undead, vulnerable to Cyrus's Turn Undead ability when he 
gets down here.
Side structures: To the left and right of the main temple, you spot smaller 
buildings-partially collapsed, but with openings. Possibly side entrances, or 
storage chambers. Darker, less visible.
The water here: Colder. The current is gentle but persistent, coming from 
the northwest. You can feel... something. Not quite magical, but present. This 
place still has power in it.
 
YOUR OPTIONS:
1.	Continue scouting the perimeter - Check those side structures, get 
a full picture
2.	Approach the main doors - Test the wards, see if you can get inside
3.	Observe the drowned ones - Watch their patrol pattern, gather 
intelligence
4.	Return to Kessa and Cyrus now - You have basic layout; bring them 
down for the assault
5.	Something else?
Current status:
*	You're at 120 feet depth, near the plaza edge
*	The drowned ones haven't noticed you yet
*	You have about 15 minutes left on your 20-minute window
*	Your invisibility (One with Shadows) won't work underwater-there's no 
darkness deep enough, just dim light
*	You're not attuned to the Trident of Warning yet, so you have normal 
initiative
What's your move?
I should be. I spent downtime training with it; I believed that included 
attunement.
Dec 9
You're absolutely right-my apologies. You spent your downtime training with 
Theros Ironfeld working with the trident. You're definitely attuned to it.
Corrected status:
*	Trident of Warning (attuned): +1 weapon, advantage on initiative, 
you and your allies within 30 feet can't be surprised while you're 
conscious
*	You have the trident in hand as you survey the temple
The weapon feels comfortable in your grip after your training sessions. Theros 
drilled you on underwater combat techniques-the resistance of water, the 
different angles of attack, how to use the current rather than fight it.
 
With the corrected information, you're at the plaza edge observing three 
drowned ones patrolling the main entrance.
Your options remain:
1.	Continue scouting the perimeter - Check those side structures, get 
the full picture
2.	Approach the main doors - Test the wards, see if you can assess 
entry difficulty
3.	Observe the drowned ones more closely - Study their patrol 
pattern, timing, behaviors
4.	Return to Kessa and Cyrus now - You have basic layout; bring them 
down
5.	Something else?
You have about 15 minutes left in your 20-minute window. What do you 
want to do?
Scout the full perimeter, especially looking for inconspicuous entry points that 
wouldn't trigger the Drowned Ones.
Dec 9
PERIMETER RECONNAISSANCE
You grip the Trident of Warning and begin a slow, careful circuit of the temple 
complex, staying low and using the scattered debris for cover. Your swimming 
is smooth and efficient thanks to the Cloak-60 feet per round, silent and 
streamlined.
 
EASTERN SIDE STRUCTURE
You approach the first side building cautiously. It's smaller than the main 
temple-maybe a priest's quarters or preparation chamber.
What you find:
*	The roof has partially collapsed, creating a large opening
*	Interior is filled with silt and debris
*	A doorway connects to the main temple-but it's blocked by rubble
*	No movement, no guards
*	Several clay vessels scattered inside, broken and empty
*	Not a viable entry point unless you want to spend significant time 
clearing rubble
You note it and continue.
 
SOUTHERN PERIMETER (Rear of Temple)
Moving around the back, the terrain slopes downward slightly. The temple's 
rear wall is more intact than you expected.
What you find:
*	A small service entrance-wooden door, mostly rotted away, leaving a 
4-foot gap
*	This leads into what looks like a storage or preparation area
*	The opening is partially obscured by fallen stonework and heavy kelp 
growth
*	No drowned ones visible back here-they're focused on the main 
plaza
*	You can see into the interior: a narrow corridor, some amphora and 
storage jars, dim but navigable
*	The corridor appears to lead toward the main sanctuary, bypassing the 
warded front doors
This looks promising. Concealed, unguarded, avoids the main entrance 
entirely.
But you continue your circuit to get the full picture.
 
WESTERN SIDE STRUCTURE
The western building is in worse shape-more collapsed than the eastern one.
What you find:
*	Mostly rubble
*	One wall still standing, but the interior is completely exposed
*	You can see straight through to the main temple's interior wall
*	That wall has a large crack-maybe 2 feet wide, running floor to 
ceiling
*	Could potentially squeeze through, but it would put you directly into the 
main sanctuary
*	One drowned one drifts past the crack occasionally-you see it 
through the gap, patrolling inside
*	Higher risk, but more direct access to the sanctuary
 
NORTHERN PERIMETER (Front Plaza - from distance)
You circle wide around the front, staying at the edge of visibility.
What you observe:
*	The three drowned ones patrol in a predictable pattern
*	They complete a full circuit of the plaza every 3-4 minutes
*	They never all face the same direction simultaneously-always 
overlapping coverage
*	The main doors' magical glow is definitely a ward-you can see it 
more clearly now, a faint blue-green shimmer
*	Approaching the main entrance without dealing with the guards would 
be risky
*	There's a large statue toppled near the doors-appears to be Zeboim 
herself, broken but recognizable
 
ASSESSMENT COMPLETE
You've circled the entire temple. Time check: about 12 minutes elapsed. 
You have 8 minutes before Kessa and Cyrus start worrying.
Entry Options:
1.	Southern service entrance (RECOMMENDED)
*	Concealed, unguarded
*	Bypasses front door wards
*	Leads to storage area, then presumably toward sanctuary
*	Safest infiltration route
2.	Western crack in wall
*	Direct access to main sanctuary
*	Risky-drowned one patrols nearby
*	Would put you immediately into potentially hostile space
*	Fast but dangerous
3.	Main doors
*	Would trigger wards (unknown effect)
*	Three drowned ones to deal with
*	Most direct route to sanctum
*	Could bring full party, fight through
4.	Eastern blocked entrance
*	Requires significant time clearing rubble
*	Would make noise underwater (vibrations)
*	Not practical for stealth approach
Additional observations:
*	The temple interior appears to be flooded but structurally sound-
walls mostly intact
*	No signs of other guardians yet, but you haven't been inside
*	The magical presence you felt earlier is stronger near the main 
doors-the wards, definitely, but possibly something else
*	Water temperature near the temple is noticeably colder-maybe 5-10 
degrees difference
 
What do you do?
1.	Return to Kessa and Cyrus now with this intelligence
2.	Investigate the southern service entrance more closely before 
returning
3.	Try to peek through the western crack to see what's in the 
sanctuary
4.	Test the main door wards somehow (carefully)
5.	Something else?
You have about 8 minutes before your window closes.
Arcana check re: Zeboim. What do we know about the goddess's 
temperament and reputation. How would she react to our collecting the 
Scepter after it has stayed here for so long?
Dec 9
KNOWLEDGE: ZEBOIM
You pause near the fallen statue, studying the broken features of the goddess. 
Even shattered and encrusted with barnacles, there's something fierce about 
her expression-wild, untamed.
Arcana Check (INT +3): 16
Your knowledge of divine entities and religious lore comes together:
 
ZEBOIM - THE SEA QUEEN
Domain & Nature:
*	Goddess of storms, tempests, the sea, and strife
*	Chaotic Neutral alignment-temperamental and unpredictable
*	Sister to Chislev (nature), daughter of Takhisis (though she rejected her 
mother's evil)
*	Known as "The Darkling Sea" and "The Dragon Turtle"
Temperament:
*	Mercurial and passionate-capable of both devastating fury and 
unexpected mercy
*	Rewards those who respect the sea's power but destroys those who 
show arrogance
*	Fiercely protective of her domain and her sacred items
*	Not evil, but dangerous-like the sea itself
*	Values strength, courage, and proper tribute
Her Priests:
*	Often sailors, storm-callers, coastal defenders
*	Conducted rituals involving offerings to calm or invoke storms
*	The temple being sealed before the Cataclysm suggests her 
priests knew and tried to preserve what was sacred
Critical Insight: Zeboim would likely view the Scepter's removal based 
on intent and necessity:
She would APPROVE if:
*	You show proper respect for her power
*	You need the Scepter for a worthy cause (defending against tyranny, 
protecting the innocent)
*	You acknowledge her authority and make an offering or tribute
*	You demonstrate courage and strength in claiming it
She would be FURIOUS if:
*	You show arrogance or entitlement
*	You steal the Scepter for selfish gain or power
*	You desecrate her temple
*	You show cowardice or disrespect
The Dragon Army Connection: The fact that the Dragon Army wants the 
Scepter is telling. Highlord Lucien likely plans to use it as a weapon of 
conquest-storm magic to destroy fleets, devastate coastlines, demonstrate 
power. This would be an abuse of Zeboim's gift, using her sacred artifact for 
tyranny.
Your mission, by contrast: You intend to use the Scepter to stop the 
Dragon Army fleet-to prevent invasion, protect the innocent, and preserve 
freedom. This is much more aligned with proper use of the goddess's power.
 
PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
What this means for your mission:
1.	Offering/Tribute: It would be wise to leave something of value when 
you take the Scepter. Not payment-tribute. Recognition of her 
authority. (Coins, a weapon, something precious to you personally)
2.	Respectful approach: Treat the temple with reverence, not as a 
dungeon to loot. You're not thieves-you're petitioners seeking aid 
against tyranny.
3.	The wards: Likely keyed to intent. Someone approaching with greed 
or arrogance might trigger hostile response. Someone approaching with 
respect and legitimate need might find easier passage.
4.	The drowned ones: Possibly her guardians, but they're undead-
corrupted versions of her priests. Zeboim wouldn't approve of undead in 
her temple. They might be a side effect of the Cataclysm, not her 
design.
5.	Stating your purpose: If you encounter any intact divine magic or 
spiritual presence, clearly state why you're here. "We seek the 
Scepter to stop those who would abuse your power for conquest."
Cyrus's role: As a cleric, he could potentially petition Zeboim directly or 
at least make proper observances. Mishakal and Zeboim aren't enemies-both 
are gods of Krynn, and Cyrus could frame this as one divine cause supporting 
another.
 
YOUR ASSESSMENT
Standing before the broken statue, you feel reasonably confident that Zeboim 
would approve of stopping the Dragon Army. The Highlord wants to 
abuse her power; you want to use it properly to defend freedom.
But the goddess is chaotic and unpredictable. Even with good intentions, 
you need to show proper respect. No arrogance, no entitlement-petition, not 
theft.
Time remaining: ~6 minutes before your window closes.
What do you do?
1.	Return to Kessa and Cyrus with full intelligence and theological 
assessment
2.	Quickly investigate the southern service entrance to confirm it's 
viable (2-3 minutes)
3.	Leave a small tribute at the statue now as a gesture before 
entering (what would you offer?)
4.	Something else?
3, then 2. What do I have of magical value that isn't immediately critical for 
mission success?
Dec 9
CHOOSING A TRIBUTE
You float before the broken statue, mentally reviewing your inventory for 
something appropriate.
Your magical items:
Currently Attuned (NOT candidates - you need these):
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (essential protection from patron)
*	Amulet of Health (keeps you alive, CON 19)
*	Trident of Warning (your primary weapon for this mission)
Equipped but not attuned:
*	Cloak of Manta Ray (absolutely critical - you're underwater)
*	Studded Leather Armor (your only armor)
*	Sending Stone (communication with Laurana/Haven)
Consumables (probably not appropriate tribute):
*	Potions (you'll likely need these)
*	Aboleth Mucus (weird, not valuable as tribute)
*	Scrolls (emergency escape items)
Items in your pack:
*	Ring of Water Walking (not attuned, party shared item)
*	Black Diamond (2,000 gp value, intended for eventual sale)
Weapons:
*	Trident of Warning (in use)
*	You likely have a backup mundane weapon?
 
THE DECISION
The Ring of Water Walking is the most logical choice:
Why it's appropriate:
*	Magical item of significant value (~1,500+ gp worth)
*	Thematically perfect - it's a water/sea-related magic item being 
offered to the goddess of the sea
*	Not currently needed (you're underwater, it does nothing here)
*	It's a party shared item, not personally attuned, so losing it won't cripple 
you
*	Shows genuine sacrifice - you're giving up something valuable, not just 
token coins
The symbolism: "We walk upon your waters by your grace, Lady of Storms. 
We return this gift to your domain and ask your blessing for our cause."
 
THE OFFERING
You swim to the broken statue's base, where the face of Zeboim lies half-
buried in silt, her stone eyes staring upward. You draw out the Ring of Water 
Walking - it gleams even in the dim light, the enchantment still active.
You place it carefully in her stone palm, clearly visible.
Then you speak-the words bubble through the water, but you mean them:
"Zeboim, Lady of Storms, Mistress of the Deeps-we come seeking 
your Scepter, not for conquest or glory, but to stop those who 
would abuse your power. The Dragon Army would use your gift to 
enslave the free peoples of Krynn. We ask your blessing to prevent 
this desecration."
You pause, then add:
"This ring is our tribute-given freely, in respect for your domain. 
May our cause prove worthy."
 
RESPONSE:
The water around the statue seems to... shift. Not violently, but noticeably. 
The current swirls around your offering, and for just a moment, you feel the 
temperature drop sharply-then warm slightly, like the sea deciding whether 
to welcome or reject you.
The ring remains where you placed it, but you sense... acknowledgment. 
Not approval or disapproval yet, but awareness. Something in this place 
knows you're here, knows what you've said, knows your intent.
The drowned ones in the plaza above don't react. Whatever just happened was 
subtle, spiritual rather than physical.
You've made your offering. Whether Zeboim will help, hinder, or remain 
neutral remains to be seen-but you've shown proper respect.
 
INVESTIGATING THE SOUTHERN SERVICE ENTRANCE
Time remaining: ~4 minutes
You move quickly to the rear of the temple, to the rotted service door with the 
kelp-shrouded opening.
You peer inside more carefully now:
The Storage Chamber:
*	About 20 feet deep, 15 feet wide
*	Multiple amphora and storage jars lining the walls-most intact, 
surprisingly
*	Shelves collapsed in places, but the space is navigable
*	Heavy silt on the floor (undisturbed for centuries)
*	A narrow corridor leads north toward the main sanctuary-maybe 4 
feet wide, decent height
*	No movement, no guardians visible
*	The corridor has a slight curve to it, preventing you from seeing all the 
way through
Checking more carefully:
*	The doorway itself is 4 feet tall/wide-easy passage
*	No wards visible (unlike the main doors)
*	The kelp provides natural concealment from outside observers
*	Scattered debris near the entrance could be moved aside quietly
One concern: The silt on the floor is thick. Moving through here will disturb 
it, creating clouds of sediment. That's unavoidable, but it's not a huge problem 
if you're careful-the current will slowly disperse it.
Assessment: This is definitely your best entry point. Concealed, unguarded, 
leads toward the interior, avoids the front door wards entirely.
 
Time check: ~2 minutes remaining
You should return to Kessa and Cyrus before they start worrying.
Heading back up:
You ascend smoothly, the Cloak making the 120-foot rise effortless. At 80 feet, 
you spot them immediately-Kessa treading water, Cyrus floating nearby 
using his Amulet's swim ability. They both turn as you approach.
Kessa's relief is obvious. "Right on time. What did you find?"
 
BRIEFING YOUR TEAM:
What do you tell them? Full layout, entry point recommendation, the offering 
to Zeboim, the drowned ones?
And what's your plan:
1.	Enter via southern service entrance (all three together, stealth 
approach)
2.	Different approach?
3.	Any specific instructions for Kessa and Cyrus?
Not the ring. But the mucus is a representation of our interaction with the 
Aboleth, which would likely be an enemy to any god/goddess. I would explain 
that the Aboleth threatened to violate the laws of the sea, to impose its will on 
others, and that we stood proudly against that. The mucus is testament to our 
actions and our dedication to freedom in all its forms.
Dec 9
A BETTER TRIBUTE
You're absolutely right. You pause, reconsidering. The ring is valuable, yes, but 
impersonal. The aboleth mucus, though...
You withdraw the vial from your waterproof pouch. The thick, opalescent 
substance swirls inside-a trophy from Khû'leth the Deep One, the ancient 
aboleth whose attempted invasion you crushed utterly.
Swimming back to the broken statue, you hold the vial before Zeboim's stone 
face.
Your offering:
"Zeboim, Lady of Storms, Mistress of the Deeps-this is the essence 
of Khû'leth, an aboleth who sought to enslave coastal peoples and 
bend the sea itself to his alien will. He would have violated the 
natural order, imposed his foul tyranny on those who live by your 
waters."
You place the vial carefully in her stone palm.
"We destroyed him and his army. Five hundred sahuagin, all 
crushed in a single strike. His brain scattered, his power broken, 
his slaves freed. This mucus is proof of our victory-proof that we 
stand against those who would corrupt your domain with slavery 
and mind control."
You meet the statue's sightless gaze.
"Now the Dragon Army seeks your Scepter to enslave others, to 
abuse your power for conquest. We ask your blessing to stop them, 
as we stopped the aboleth. We fight for freedom-in all its forms, 
upon all waters."
 
RESPONSE
The water around the statue surges.
Not violently, but powerfully-a sudden current that swirls around you, 
around the vial, around the broken face of the goddess. The temperature 
plunges ice-cold for three heartbeats, then warms to almost pleasant.
The vial remains in the statue's palm, but the mucus inside seems 
to... dissolve. Not physically-you can still see it-but something about it 
changes. Becomes more translucent. Accepted.
And then you feel it: approval.
Not words, not a voice, but a sensation like the moment before a storm 
breaks-that electric tension in the air, that promise of wild power about to be 
unleashed. The sea itself seems to acknowledge you.
You have pleased Zeboim.
Your enemy was her enemy-aboleths are antithetical to the natural chaos of 
the sea, imposing rigid mental slavery where there should be freedom and wild 
power. And you offered proof of your victory, not mere gold or trinkets.
The drowned ones in the plaza above... you glance up. They've stopped 
moving. All three are perfectly still, facing away from the temple entrance, 
looking outward as if watching for external threats.
They're not attacking. They're... guarding for you now?
The path is clear.
 
RETURNING TO YOUR TEAM
You ascend swiftly, the Cloak propelling you effortlessly through the water. At 
80 feet, Kessa and Cyrus turn as you approach.
Kessa's relief is obvious. "Right on time. What did you find?"
You quickly brief them:
"The temple's more intact than expected. Three drowned ones were 
patrolling the main entrance, but I made an offering to Zeboim-
the aboleth mucus. Told her we stopped Khû'leth from enslaving 
her domain, and that we're here to stop the Dragon Army from 
abusing her Scepter the same way."
Cyrus's eyes widen. "You... petitioned the goddess directly? And 
she answered?"
"She approved. The drowned ones have stopped patrolling-they're 
facing outward now, like they're guarding the temple from external 
threats instead of guarding it from us."
Kessa grins. "So we just got divine clearance for a heist. I love it."
"There's a service entrance at the rear of the temple-unguarded, 
no wards, leads to a storage area and then toward the main 
sanctuary. That's our way in. The main doors have wards on them, 
and even with Zeboim's blessing, I'd rather not test them if we 
don't have to."
Cyrus nods thoughtfully. "A wise choice. If the goddess has granted us 
passage, we should still show proper caution and respect. We are petitioners, 
not conquerors."
Your briefing continues:
*	Temple layout (plaza, main sanctuary, inner sanctum)
*	Southern service entrance (concealed, 4-foot opening, kelp-shrouded)
*	Interior likely flooded but structurally sound
*	Magical presence strongest near main doors
*	Side structures mostly collapsed/blocked
Kessa checks her daggers. "So we go in quiet, through the back, show proper 
respect, find the Scepter, and get out. Simple."
Cyrus adjusts his holy symbol. "And if we encounter guardians inside?"
 
Good question. What's your approach?
1.	Full stealth - Avoid all contact if possible, treat this as sacred ground
2.	Prepared for combat - Cyrus can Turn Undead if needed, but prefer 
talking first
3.	Diplomatic - Announce yourselves as Zeboim's petitioners, speak to 
any guardians
4.	Something else?
And marching order for the descent and entry?
*	Johannes (Trident of Warning gives party advantage on initiative, can't 
be surprised)
*	Kessa (stealth expert, perception, trap-finding)
*	Cyrus (support, healing, divine magic)
Or different arrangement?
3 if the opposition is something that can be reasoned with, 1 if it is mindless 
or elemental.
Dec 9
FINAL PREPARATIONS
"If we encounter anything that can be reasoned with-guardians, spirits, even 
intelligent undead-we speak first," you say. "We're here with Zeboim's 
blessing, not as thieves. But if it's mindless or elemental, we stay quiet and 
avoid it entirely. No unnecessary conflict in a goddess's temple."
Cyrus nods approvingly. "A balanced approach. Wisdom and respect in equal 
measure."
Kessa shrugs. "I can work with that. Though if something does attack, I'm not 
holding back."
"Fair enough. Marching order: I'll take point with the Trident-we can't be 
surprised while I'm conscious. Kessa, stay close behind me for trap-spotting 
and stealth. Cyrus, rear guard with support and healing ready."
"Understood," Cyrus confirms.
"One more thing," you add. "The water inside will be dark-possibly 
no light at all in the inner chambers. I can see in magical darkness, 
but you two will need light sources. Cyrus, can you provide that 
without alerting everything in the temple?"
Cyrus considers. "I can cast Light on a small object-a coin, a stone-and 
cover it when stealth is needed. Or I can use my more subtle spells if 
necessary. The choice is yours."
Kessa pats her gear. "I've got a hooded lantern if we need mundane light. 
Waterproof, adjustable shutter."
 
THE DESCENT - TOGETHER
The three of you descend in formation. The water grows darker, colder, more 
oppressive with each passing moment. At 100 feet, Kessa glances at you, her 
expression serious but calm. At 120 feet, the temple emerges from the gloom.
What Kessa and Cyrus see:
Cyrus's reaction is reverent. He makes a sign of blessing as the structure 
comes into view. "Magnificent... even in ruin, you can feel the divine 
presence."
Kessa's more practical. "Those the drowned ones you mentioned?" She points 
toward the plaza.
You nod. The three undead are exactly as you left them-facing outward, still 
as statues, not patrolling. They don't react as you approach.
"They're... guarding for us?" Kessa sounds incredulous.
"Zeboim's will," Cyrus murmurs. "The goddess has granted us passage. 
Remarkable."
 
APPROACHING THE SERVICE ENTRANCE
You lead them around the southern perimeter, staying low and using debris 
for concealment-though with the drowned ones not actively patrolling, it 
feels almost unnecessary.
The kelp-shrouded service entrance appears exactly as you scouted it. You 
gesture: There. Our entry point.
Kessa moves forward, examining the opening with professional interest. She 
tests the rotted door frame, checks the kelp for resistance, peers into the dark 
interior. After a moment, she nods: Clear. No traps visible.
Cyrus casts Light on a small smooth stone, then immediately covers it with a 
dark cloth. "Ready when you are."
 
ENTERING THE TEMPLE
You slip through the opening first, Trident ready. The storage chamber is 
exactly as you remembered-amphora, collapsed shelves, thick silt on the 
floor. Your movement stirs up a small cloud of sediment, but the current 
slowly disperses it.
Kessa follows, moving with practiced grace. Her eyes adjust to the darkness-
or rather, Cyrus uncovers the light stone slightly, casting a dim blue-white 
glow across the chamber.
Cyrus enters last, his movements careful and respectful. He glances around 
the storage area, taking in the ancient vessels and forgotten supplies. "These 
were sealed before the Cataclysm. The priests knew what was coming..." His 
voice is soft, reverent.
The Storage Chamber - Detailed Look:
Now that you have light (dim but sufficient), you can see more:
*	The amphora contain preserved goods-oil, grain, wine. Still sealed after 
280 years.
*	Religious items on the shelves: censers, offering bowls, ritual 
implements
*	Everything is arranged with care, not hastily abandoned
*	A sense of preparation, not panic
*	The priests sealed this place deliberately, preserving what was sacred
The Northern Corridor:
Ahead, the narrow passage leads deeper into the temple. It curves slightly to 
the right, preventing you from seeing the full length. The walls are carved with 
reliefs-waves, fish, storms rendered in flowing stone.
Kessa moves to the corridor entrance, listening carefully. After a moment, she 
signals: No movement. No sounds.
 
PROCEEDING FORWARD
You advance into the corridor, Trident held ready. The passage is about 30 
feet long, curving gently. The carvings become more elaborate as you 
progress-you see Zeboim herself depicted multiple times, commanding 
storms, blessing ships, drowning the arrogant.
At the end of the corridor, you see an archway opening into a larger space 
beyond. Dim blue-green light filters through-not sunlight (you're too deep), 
but something else. Magical? Bioluminescent?
You approach cautiously and peer through the archway.
 
THE MAIN SANCTUARY - FIRST GLIMPSE
The chamber beyond is vast-maybe 60 feet across, with a high vaulted ceiling 
that's partially collapsed. Water flows freely through the space, and the source 
of the light becomes clear:
Glowing coral grows along the walls and pillars, pulsing with soft 
bioluminescence. It's beautiful, ethereal, casting shifting shadows across 
ancient mosaics on the floor.
The chamber layout:
*	Central altar: A raised platform in the middle, carved from dark stone. 
Empty now, but clearly the focal point
*	Pillars: Six massive columns supporting the vaulted ceiling-three still 
standing, three collapsed
*	Side alcoves: Small shrine spaces along the walls, most filled with 
debris
*	Northern doorway: Directly opposite your position, another 
archway-larger, more ornate, with intact double doors
*	Those doors are sealed: Heavy bronze, with glowing glyphs across 
their surface
*	That must be the Inner Sanctum-where the Scepter would be kept
Guardians?
Your Trident tingles with warning. There's something here.
You scan the chamber carefully-
THERE.
Floating near the central altar: a translucent, humanoid figure. Not quite 
solid, not quite ghost. It wears robes that ripple like water, and its face is 
serene but watchful.
A water spirit? A temple guardian? The ghost of a priest?
As you watch, it turns slowly-almost as if on patrol-and faces your direction. 
For a moment, you think it's spotted you.
But then it continues its rotation, circling the altar in a slow, deliberate 
pattern. Guarding. Waiting.
It hasn't noticed you yet.
Kessa and Cyrus have seen it too. Kessa's hand moves to her dagger 
instinctively. Cyrus holds up a hand: Wait.
 
What's your approach?
1.	Announce yourselves - Step into the sanctuary, speak clearly, 
identify as Zeboim's petitioners
2.	Cyrus leads - Have the cleric approach first, religious figure to 
(potentially) religious guardian
3.	Observe longer - Watch the spirit's pattern, assess if it's hostile or 
neutral
4.	Try to bypass - Move through the chamber stealthily, avoid interaction 
entirely
5.	Something else?
The spirit continues its slow patrol around the altar, unaware of your 
presence-for now.
Kessa has darkvision (half-elf); Cyrus got the Googles of Night for this very 
reason.
Dec 9
CORRECTED - LIGHT SOURCES
You're absolutely right. My apologies.
Corrected:
*	Kessa has darkvision 60 ft (half-elf) - she can see fine in the darkness
*	Cyrus has the Goggles of Night from the aboleth mission loot - 
darkvision 60 ft when worn
*	Johannes has Devil's Sight (see normally in magical darkness, 120 ft)
Cyrus didn't cast Light-he simply donned his goggles as you entered the 
temple. The three of you move through the darkness with no need for 
illumination, which maintains perfect stealth.
 
THE MAIN SANCTUARY - CORRECTED VIEW
The chamber is dark except for the glowing coral providing dim 
bioluminescence along the walls. To normal eyes, it would be nearly 
impossible to navigate. But between your Devil's Sight, Kessa's darkvision, and 
Cyrus's goggles, you all see clearly.
The translucent guardian spirit continues its slow patrol around the central 
altar, unaware of your presence in the shadowed archway.
With proper vision established:
You can see the entire sanctuary clearly:
*	Central altar (dark stone, currently empty)
*	Six pillars (three standing, three collapsed)
*	Side alcoves with debris
*	Northern doorway with sealed bronze doors (glowing glyphs)
*	The water spirit/guardian circling methodically
Kessa studies the spirit with professional assessment, her darkvision giving 
her clear sight. She signals: Alone. Patterned movement. Hasn't detected us.
Cyrus adjusts his goggles slightly, examining the guardian with his cleric's 
insight. He leans close and whispers barely audibly: "Not undead. Not fully 
corporeal. Perhaps a bound spirit-a temple warden left by the priests."
 
What's your approach?
1.	Announce yourselves - Step into the sanctuary, speak clearly, 
identify as Zeboim's petitioners
2.	Cyrus leads - Have the cleric approach first, religious figure to 
(potentially) religious guardian
3.	Observe longer - Watch the spirit's pattern, assess if it's hostile or 
neutral
4.	Try to bypass - Move through the chamber stealthily, avoid interaction 
entirely
5.	Something else?
The spirit continues its patrol, and you remain undetected in the darkness.
I don't think Zeboim would resent conflict; fighting for one's interest is at the 
heart of true freedom, but it can't be capricious or unnecessary. So let's 
observe to ascertain if this is a test of self-control.
Dec 9
OBSERVATION AND ASSESSMENT
You signal Kessa and Cyrus to hold position, settling in to watch the spirit's 
behavior. Zeboim is chaotic, yes-but not mindlessly violent. She respects 
strength, courage, and proper respect. If this guardian is her will made 
manifest, understanding its purpose matters.
You observe for several minutes, noting every detail:
 
THE GUARDIAN'S PATTERN
Movement:
*	Completes a full circuit around the altar every 90 seconds (remarkably 
precise for something supposedly chaotic)
*	Never strays more than 15 feet from the altar
*	Passes within 5 feet of the northern doorway (the Inner Sanctum 
entrance) on each rotation
*	Its path is perfectly consistent-not random patrol, but deliberate??
Behavior:
*	Doesn't investigate the side alcoves
*	Doesn't approach the archway where you entered
*	Never looks toward the collapsed sections
*	Focuses entirely on the altar and the sealed doorway beyond
Nature of the guardian: You study it more carefully with your warlock's 
understanding of magical entities:
It's translucent but stable-not flickering like a ghost, not shapeless like a 
water elemental. The robes flow with water-like motion, but the figure itself 
maintains consistent form. Humanoid features are visible: serene face, hands 
folded as if in prayer or meditation, no visible weapons.
Not aggressive. Not hunting. Not even particularly alert.
It's... waiting. Maintaining presence. Holding a post.
 
ARCANA/INSIGHT CHECK
You consider what you're seeing through multiple lenses:
As a Warlock (Arcana): This is bound magic-a spirit anchored to this 
place by divine command, not imprisonment. It's fulfilling a duty, not 
suffering a curse. The binding is seamless, willing, purposeful.
As someone who understands contracts (Insight): The spirit's 
behavior suggests specific instructions: Guard the altar. Protect the 
sanctum entrance. Maintain presence. But nothing about "attack all intruders" 
or "prevent access at all costs."
As someone recently blessed by Zeboim: You remember the sensation 
when you made your offering-that electric awareness, that acknowledgment. 
The drowned ones changed their behavior after Zeboim approved your 
petition. They stopped patrolling threats and started guarding outward.
This spirit hasn't changed behavior.
Why?
 
THE TEST
You lean close to Cyrus and Kessa, whispering barely audibly: "It's not hostile. 
It's waiting."
Cyrus nods slowly, studying the spirit through his goggles. "A test, perhaps? 
Zeboim approved our presence, but..."
"But she wants to see what we do with that approval," you finish. "She's 
chaotic-she values choice, freedom of action. Will we sneak past like thieves, 
or will we announce ourselves like petitioners?"
Kessa considers this. "Or will we attack because we can? Prove we're strong 
enough to take what we want?"
"No," Cyrus says quietly but firmly. "She values strength, yes-but 
also respect. The drowned ones guard for us because we showed proper 
reverence. This spirit..." He pauses. "This spirit guards the sanctum. The 
sacred heart of her temple. If we're truly petitioners, not thieves, we 
should ask permission to enter."
You watch the spirit complete another circuit. It shows no sign of aggression, 
no indication it would attack unprovoked. But it is between you and the Inner 
Sanctum doors.
The test becomes clear:
Zeboim wants to see if you'll:
1.	Sneak past (technically respectful but avoiding true interaction-
cowardly?)
2.	Attack preemptively (showing strength but unnecessary violence-
arrogant?)
3.	Announce yourselves (showing courage and respect-proper 
petitioner behavior?)
The goddess of storms values bold action and proper respect in equal 
measure. Sneaking seems... insufficient. Attacking seems disrespectful. 
Speaking seems right.
 
CYRUS'S ASSESSMENT
The cleric watches for another moment, then turns to you. "I believe it will 
allow us passage if we approach with proper respect. It guards the sanctum, 
yes-but from whom? From thieves and defilers. Not from those granted 
Zeboim's blessing."
He pauses. "But the spirit won't know we have that blessing unless we tell it. 
It's bound to its duty-it can't simply leave its post because the drowned ones 
changed behavior."
Kessa nods slowly. "So we announce ourselves. Let it know we're here with the 
goddess's permission. If it attacks anyway..." She touches her dagger. "Then 
we defend ourselves. But we give it the chance to stand aside peacefully."
 
Your decision?
1.	Step forward and announce yourselves - "We are petitioners, 
blessed by Zeboim. We seek the Scepter to prevent its desecration."
2.	Have Cyrus approach alone first - Cleric to spirit, divine authority 
meeting divine guardian
3.	Try to bypass after all - Maybe you're overthinking this; the spirit 
might simply ignore you
4.	Something else?
The spirit completes another circuit, passing near the sealed sanctum doors, 
then continuing its eternal vigil around the altar.
We announce our presence, and respect Zeboim's freedom to test our 
humility. Regardless of the spirit's reaction, even if it is hostile, we stand firm 
until it actually harms someone. I will move in front of the others, so I take the 
attack if it happens. It will get advantage because I will not react until blood is 
spilled.
Dec 9
ANNOUNCING PRESENCE
You step forward from the archway, moving past Kessa and Cyrus into the 
open sanctuary. Your trident is held low-not threatening, but ready. You 
position yourself clearly in front of your companions, making your body the 
barrier between them and any potential threat.
Kessa starts to move up beside you, but you gesture her back: Stay behind me.
She hesitates, clearly unhappy about letting you take point alone, but respects 
your decision.
Cyrus understands immediately. He nods solemnly and remains at your 
shoulder-close enough to heal, far enough to let you take the lead.
 
THE ANNOUNCEMENT
You raise your voice, letting it carry through the water-filled chamber. Your 
tone is respectful but firm-petitioner, not supplicant. Free person addressing 
another power, not beggar pleading for scraps.
"Guardian of Zeboim's temple-we announce ourselves."
The spirit stops mid-circuit. It turns slowly toward you, its translucent form 
rippling like disturbed water. The serene face regards you with ancient, patient 
eyes.
"I am Johannes Constantinius. With me are Kessa Darrow and 
Brother Cyrus of Mishakal. We come as petitioners, blessed by the 
Lady of Storms. We seek the Tempest Scepter-not for conquest or 
personal glory, but to stop those who would abuse your goddess's 
power."
The spirit drifts closer, moving with that same unhurried grace. It's now 20 
feet away, still approaching. You hold your ground.
"We destroyed Khû'leth the Deep One, an aboleth who sought to 
enslave the coastal peoples and corrupt the sea with his mind-
slavery. We offered proof of that victory to Zeboim herself. She 
acknowledged us. She granted us passage."
15 feet away now. The spirit's eyes-if they can be called eyes-study you with 
unreadable intensity.
You lower your trident completely, holding it at your side. Non-threatening. 
Vulnerable.
"We respect your duty, guardian. We respect your goddess's 
domain. We stand before you openly, offering you the same 
freedom Zeboim values: the freedom to choose. Test us if you must. 
We will not strike first."
 
THE SPIRIT'S RESPONSE
It's now 10 feet away. Close enough to attack if it wishes. You feel Cyrus tense 
behind you, ready to heal or intervene. Kessa's hand is on her dagger, but she's 
holding position.
The spirit raises one translucent arm-
You remain absolutely still. If this is an attack, so be it. You've stated your 
case. You've shown respect. The rest is Zeboim's will.
The arm extends toward you, palm open. Not a fist. Not a weapon.
It touches your chest-or rather, the water where your chest is. The contact 
sends a shock through you, cold and electric like lightning through water. Not 
painful, but probing. Searching.
CHA Save (your CHA is +3): Roll with advantage? No-you allowed this. 
You're not resisting.
Roll: 8 +3 = 11
The spirit's presence washes over you, through you, examining your intent, 
your truth, your purpose. You feel it reading you like Zeboim herself might-
looking past words to the core of who you are.
It sees:
*	Your curse, your bound service to a demon
*	Your military past, your unit's death
*	Your desperate search for freedom
*	Your fierce protection of the innocent
*	Your malicious compliance with your patron's demands
*	Your hatred of slavery in all its forms
*	Your willingness to sacrifice for others
The spirit sees all of it.
 
JUDGMENT
The cold presence withdraws. The spirit steps back, its hand lowering.
Then it speaks-not with a voice, but with words that form directly in your 
mind, carried by water and divine will:
"YOU SPEAK TRUTH. YOU FIGHT BONDAGE. YOU HONOR 
FREEDOM."
The spirit turns away from you, floating back toward the central altar. But 
instead of resuming its patrol, it positions itself to one side-deliberately 
clearing the path to the northern doorway and the sealed sanctum beyond.
"THE LADY OF STORMS HAS GRANTED YOU PASSAGE. I DO NOT 
OPPOSE HER WILL. ENTER THE SANCTUM. CLAIM THE 
SCEPTER. USE IT WISELY."
A pause, then one final statement:
"SHOW THE SAME COURAGE YOU SHOWED HERE. DO NOT 
WAVER WHEN THE STORM TESTS YOU."
The spirit becomes perfectly still-no longer guarding against you, but 
guarding for you, much like the drowned ones outside.
 
THE PATH IS CLEAR
Cyrus releases a breath he'd been holding. "Blessed Mishakal... Johannes, you 
just submitted yourself to divine judgment and passed."
Kessa moves up beside you, studying the spirit warily. "That was either the 
bravest or the stupidest thing I've ever watched. Probably both." She grins 
slightly. "But it worked."
You look at the northern doorway-the sealed bronze doors with their glowing 
glyphs. The Inner Sanctum lies beyond. The Tempest Scepter waits.
But the spirit's final words echo in your mind: "Do not waver when the storm 
tests you."
There's another test coming. Inside the sanctum. Something more than just 
retrieving an artifact.
 
Approaching the sealed doors:
The three of you move toward the northern archway. Up close, the doors are 
magnificent-bronze worked with reliefs of storms, lightning, crashing waves. 
The glyphs glow with soft blue-green light, clearly magical wards.
But now that you're close, you can read what the glyphs say. They're in an 
ancient dialect, but Cyrus translates:
"Enter with reverence. Speak your purpose. Prove your worth."
The doors aren't locked. They're waiting.
 
What do you do?
1.	Open the doors directly - You've been granted passage; proceed with 
confidence
2.	Speak your purpose aloud first - State why you're here before 
entering
3.	Have Cyrus perform a blessing/prayer - Religious observance 
before entering the sanctum
4.	Check for additional wards or traps - Kessa examines the doors 
first
5.	Something else?
The guardian spirit watches silently from the altar, patient and approving.
3, then 2, then wait until these two steps are acknowledged.
Dec 9
PRAYERS AND PURPOSE
You gesture to Cyrus. "Brother-this is a sacred place. We should honor it 
properly."
Cyrus nods, moving forward to stand before the bronze doors. He removes his 
holy symbol of Mishakal-the blue crystal infinity symbol-and holds it 
reverently in both hands. Kessa and you bow your heads respectfully.
 
CYRUS'S PRAYER
The cleric's voice is clear and sincere, carrying through the water-filled 
sanctuary:
"Zeboim, Lady of Storms, Mistress of the Deeps, Queen of 
Tempests-we stand before your sanctum with humble hearts and 
righteous purpose."
He raises the symbol of Mishakal slightly.
"I am Brother Cyrus, servant of Mishakal the Healing Hand. 
Though we serve different aspects of the divine, we both honor the 
sacred bonds of Krynn. We both stand against tyranny and the 
enslavement of the free peoples."
A pause, then he continues:
"We ask your blessing as we enter your inner sanctum. We seek the 
Tempest Scepter not for ourselves, but to prevent its desecration by 
those who would use your power to conquer and enslave. Grant us 
your favor, Lady of Storms, that we may prove worthy of the trust 
you have shown us."
He bows deeply, holding the position for several heartbeats.
"May Mishakal's compassion and your wild strength work together 
this day. May freedom triumph over bondage. May the storm break 
the chains of tyranny."
 
RESPONSE TO THE PRAYER
The water around the doors stirs-not violently, but noticeably. The current 
swirls in a tight spiral around the bronze surfaces, and the glyphs flare 
brighter for a moment before settling back to their steady glow.
The guardian spirit at the altar shifts slightly-you feel its approval, though it 
doesn't speak.
Cyrus lowers his holy symbol and steps back, nodding to you. "The goddess 
hears us. Proceed."
 
STATING YOUR PURPOSE
You move forward to stand directly before the doors, your hand resting on the 
bronze surface. The metal is cold even through the water, ancient and 
powerful.
You speak clearly, projecting your voice to fill the sanctum:
"Zeboim, we are Johannes Constantinius, Kessa Darrow, and 
Brother Cyrus. We seek the Tempest Scepter to stop the Dragon 
Army fleet staging at Flotsam. Fifteen warships prepare to sail 
against the free peoples of Ansalon, carrying invasion and 
conquest."
You press your palm flat against the door.
"Highlord Lucien of the Dragon Army seeks this very Scepter-not 
to honor your power, but to abuse it. To use your storms as 
weapons of tyranny. To bend your wild strength to his master's 
will. We would deny him this desecration."
Your voice hardens with conviction:
"We will use the Scepter to destroy his fleet, to break his invasion 
before it begins, to preserve the freedom of those who would 
otherwise fall to slavery. We will wield your power for one 
purpose-liberation-and then return it to your domain, our 
purpose fulfilled."
A final statement:
"We have fought aboleths and dragons. We have freed prisoners 
and broken chains. We stand before you not as conquerors or 
thieves, but as warriors of freedom seeking a weapon against 
tyranny. Judge us worthy or wanting-but know that we speak only 
truth."
 
THE SANCTUM'S RESPONSE
Silence for three heartbeats.
Then the glyphs on the doors blaze brilliant blue-white, so bright that 
even your Devil's Sight is momentarily dazzled. Kessa shields her eyes; Cyrus 
turns his head slightly but maintains his reverent stance.
The light pulses once, twice, three times-like a heartbeat, like waves crashing, 
like lightning striking.
Then the bronze doors swing open.
Not slowly, not ominously-but welcomingly. As if the sanctum itself is 
inviting you inside, acknowledging your stated purpose and granting access.
The guardian spirit's voice echoes in your mind once more:
"THE LADY HAS HEARD. THE LADY HAS JUDGED. ENTER, 
WARRIORS OF FREEDOM. FACE THE STORM."
 
THE INNER SANCTUM REVEALED
Beyond the doors lies a chamber that takes your breath away.
The sanctum is smaller than the main sanctuary-perhaps 40 feet across-
but perfectly preserved. The walls are covered in intricate mosaics showing 
Zeboim's greatest acts: storms that saved desperate sailors, tempests that 
destroyed tyrant fleets, the wild beauty of the unfettered sea.
The chamber's features:
Central Pedestal: At the room's heart stands a pedestal of dark stone, 
carved with spiraling patterns like whirlpools and hurricanes. Upon it rests-
The Tempest Scepter.
Even from the doorway, you can see it clearly: approximately three feet long, 
worked from what appears to be solidified storm cloud and lightning given 
physical form. Silver-grey metal shot through with crackling blue-white 
energy. The head is shaped like a thunderhead, with stylized lightning bolts 
extending downward. It practically hums with contained power.
The Water: The water in this chamber is different. It moves in a slow, 
circular pattern around the pedestal-a perpetual whirlpool, gentle but 
constant. The current pulls everything toward the center, then spirals upward 
along the walls before descending again.
The Ceiling: Unlike the collapsed main sanctuary, this ceiling is intact-
domed, covered in mother-of-pearl that catches and reflects light in shifting 
patterns. It almost looks like storm clouds moving overhead.
The Test: Standing between you and the pedestal, positioned in the circling 
current, are three figures.
Water Elementals.
Not small ones. Each is roughly eight feet tall, vaguely humanoid but clearly 
composed entirely of animated water. They don't appear hostile-they're 
simply there, moving with the circular current, maintaining their positions 
around the pedestal.
Guardians? A test? Both?
As you watch, they continue their slow rotation, never breaking formation, 
never approaching the pedestal or the doors. They're like the current itself 
given form and purpose.
The spirit's final words echo again: "Do not waver when the storm tests you."
 
ASSESSMENT
Kessa studies the elementals warily. "Three of them. Large. Between us and 
the Scepter." She glances at you. "Fighting or talking?"
Cyrus considers carefully. "They move with the current... they're part of the 
sanctum's defense, not separate from it. Perhaps..." He pauses. "Perhaps 
they'll test our strength. Zeboim values courage and power as much as 
respect."
You study the chamber, the elementals, the Scepter. The test is clear enough: 
can you reach the pedestal and claim the Scepter? Will you be strong enough? 
Brave enough? Worthy enough?
But the elementals aren't attacking. They're waiting. Like everything else in 
this temple, they're giving you the chance to act first.
 
What's your approach?
1.	Announce yourselves again - State your purpose to the elementals 
specifically
2.	Simply walk forward - Proceed confidently toward the pedestal, see 
if they react
3.	Prepare for combat - Assume they'll attack once you get close enough
4.	Study the current pattern - Look for a way to work with the 
whirlpool rather than against it
5.	Something else?
The Tempest Scepter awaits on its pedestal, humming with storm-born power. 
The water elementals circle endlessly, patient and implacable.
But even in this act, we must respect the sanctity of life. There are soldiers 
aboard these ships who are following the orders of their leaders, who may act 
out of honest loyalty to their comrades, but not out of a love of darkness or 
evil. We will seek to spare life as we can, though the lives of innocents must 
take precedence.
Dec 9
THE COMPLETE TRUTH
You pause, realizing you spoke incompletely. The elementals continue their 
patient rotation, but something in the chamber's energy feels... expectant. 
Waiting for the whole truth, not just part of it.
You step forward, speaking again to the sanctum, to Zeboim, to the test itself:
"But I must speak the complete truth-for anything less dishonors 
this sacred place."
Your voice carries across the water, sincere and resolute:
"Even in destroying this fleet, we must respect the sanctity of life. 
There are soldiers aboard those ships who follow orders given by 
their commanders, who act out of honest loyalty to their comrades 
and their homes. Not all who serve the Dragon Army do so from 
love of darkness or evil. Some are conscripts. Some are deceived. 
Some simply know no other path."
You meet the gaze of the nearest elemental-if such beings can be said to have 
gazes.
"We will use the Scepter to break their invasion, yes. But we will 
seek to spare life where we can. We will target ships, not sailors. 
We will give them the chance to surrender, to flee, to choose 
freedom over their masters' tyranny. The lives of the innocents 
they threaten must take precedence-but we will not become 
butchers ourselves."
Kessa glances at you, understanding dawning on her face. Cyrus nods slowly, 
his expression approving.
You continue:
"Zeboim values freedom-true freedom, which includes the 
freedom to make mistakes, to serve the wrong masters, to be 
redeemed. We will not abuse your power by using it to slaughter 
those who might yet choose a better path. We will use the storm to 
break chains, not to forge new ones in blood."
A final statement, spoken with absolute conviction:
"If that makes us unworthy of the Scepter, so be it. But we will not 
lie to gain your favor. This is who we are. This is how we will wield 
your power."
 
THE SANCTUM'S TRUE RESPONSE
The water in the chamber surges.
The gentle whirlpool becomes a powerful current, spinning faster, pulling 
everything toward the center with tremendous force. The three water 
elementals are caught in it, spiraling inward-
And then they dissolve.
Not destroyed-released. They flow back into the current, becoming part of 
the sanctum's waters again, their purpose fulfilled. They were never meant to 
fight you. They were meant to bear witness.
The current slows, gentles, returns to its perpetual rotation.
And the Tempest Scepter on its pedestal flares brilliant white-blue, 
lightning crackling across its surface in approval.
A presence fills the chamber-not the guardian spirit, not the elementals, but 
something vast and wild and approving. Zeboim herself, perhaps, or simply 
her will made manifest in this sacred space.
Words form in your mind, in all three of your minds simultaneously, spoken in 
the voice of storm and sea:
"YOU UNDERSTAND. POWER WITHOUT WISDOM IS TYRANNY. 
STRENGTH WITHOUT MERCY IS CRUELTY. FREEDOM 
WITHOUT RESPONSIBILITY IS CHAOS."
The presence intensifies:
"YOU WOULD WIELD MY STORM NOT FOR CONQUEST, BUT FOR 
LIBERATION. YOU WOULD SPARE EVEN YOUR ENEMIES 
WHERE YOU CAN. YOU SPEAK TRUTH EVEN WHEN IT MIGHT 
COST YOU THE PRIZE YOU SEEK."
A pause, like the stillness before thunder:
"YOU ARE WORTHY."
 
THE GIFT
The current around the pedestal parts, creating a clear path directly to the 
Scepter. The water itself seems to guide you forward, gentle pressure at your 
back propelling you toward the artifact.
You swim forward, Kessa and Cyrus following close behind. The three of you 
approach the pedestal together.
Up close, the Tempest Scepter is even more magnificent. It's not metal-it's 
solidified storm essence, lightning frozen into semi-physical form, cloud given 
weight and substance. Power radiates from it in waves, making your skin 
tingle even through the water.
You reach out slowly, respectfully-
Your hand closes around the shaft.
POWER floods through you.
Not overwhelming, not crushing-but immense. You feel the potential 
contained in this artifact: storms that could level cities, lightning that could 
shatter mountains, tempests that could sink entire fleets. The raw, untamed 
power of nature itself, focused and directed through divine will.
But you also feel control. This isn't wild magic that might escape your grasp. 
This is a tool, a weapon, a gift freely given by a goddess who trusts you to wield 
it properly.
The Scepter accepts you. You are its bearer now, its wielder, its master for as 
long as your purpose aligns with Zeboim's values.
 
THE SCEPTER'S PROPERTIES
As you hold it, knowledge flows into your mind-not words, 
but understanding:
Tempest Scepter (Artifact - requires attunement)
*	Functions as a +2 quarterstaff in melee
*	Call Lightning (at will): As the 3rd-level spell, no concentration 
required, CL 9, DC 17
*	Control Weather (1/day): As the 8th-level spell, but limited to 
storm/tempest effects
*	Storm's Fury (1/day): Summon a massive storm in a 1-mile radius-
devastating winds, lightning, torrential rain. Essentially weaponized 
weather.
*	Resistance to lightning and thunder damage
*	Water breathing (constant, for bearer and allies within 30 feet)
But there's also a responsibility:
*	The Scepter judges its wielder continuously
*	Using it for tyranny, conquest, or needless cruelty will cause it to reject 
you violently
*	Using it to defend freedom, break chains, or protect the innocent 
strengthens the bond
*	When your stated purpose is fulfilled, you must return it to Zeboim's 
domain or find a worthy successor
 
ATTUNEMENT DECISION
You're currently attuned to:
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding (essential - patron protection)
2.	Amulet of Health (CON 19, substantial HP boost)
3.	Trident of Warning (advantage on initiative, no surprise)
The Tempest Scepter requires attunement. You'll need to un-attune 
from one item.
Recommendation: Un-attune from the Trident of Warning for now. The 
Scepter is far more powerful and directly mission-critical. You can re-attune to 
the Trident after you've used the Scepter and returned it.
Do you:
1.	Attune to the Scepter now (choose which item to un-attune from)
2.	Wait until you're back on the Stormbreaker to handle 
attunement
3.	Have someone else attune to it (though it clearly chose you)
Cyrus and Kessa watch with awe and respect. Kessa whistles softly. "That's... 
that's a weapon that could change the course of the war."
Cyrus's expression is more thoughtful. "And the responsibility that comes with 
it is equally heavy. Use it well, Johannes."
The sanctum's presence has faded to a gentle awareness. The test is complete. 
The Scepter is yours.
What do you do?
I give it to Cyrus. He was the most strongly affected by the recognition that 
calling down the storm could end the lives of hundreds of Dragon Army 
soldiers. He did not see that as a victory, but as a great loss. Whatever I said 
was a direct response to his initial reaction; he is the only one who should be 
trusted to carry it. He can attune to it at his discretion.
Dec 9
THE TRUE WORTHY BEARER
You hold the Scepter for a long moment, feeling its power thrumming through 
your hands. Then you turn to Cyrus.
The cleric looks at you questioningly, but you see understanding beginning to 
dawn in his eyes.
"Brother Cyrus," you say formally, "this is not mine to wield."
You extend the Tempest Scepter toward him.
"When we first discussed this mission-destroying the Dragon 
Army fleet-you were troubled. Not by the necessity of it, but by the 
cost. You saw beyond the tactical victory to the hundreds of lives 
that would be lost. Soldiers following orders. Young men far from 
home. People who might yet choose a different path."
Cyrus starts to protest: "Johannes, the goddess chose-"
You cut him off gently but firmly:
"She tested me, yes. But what I said-the recognition that we must 
spare life where we can, that not all who serve darkness do so 
willingly, that we must balance justice with mercy-those weren't 
my thoughts alone. They were yours. You spoke them first, when 
we planned this operation. I only gave voice to what you taught 
me."
You press the Scepter into his hands.
"You are a healer, Cyrus. A servant of Mishakal. You understand 
the sanctity of life better than any of us. If anyone can wield a 
weapon of such devastating power while still honoring that 
sanctity, it's you. Not me-I'm bound to a demon and fight every 
day not to become what my curse wants me to be. Not Kessa-she's 
a killer, skilled and necessary, but she strikes first and asks 
questions later."
Kessa doesn't argue. She nods slowly, accepting the truth of it.
"You, Brother Cyrus, will use this power with wisdom. You'll call 
the storm when you must, but you'll grieve the necessity. You'll give 
them every chance to surrender. You'll remember that each life 
lost is a tragedy, not just a statistic. That's why you should bear this 
burden."
 
CYRUS'S RESPONSE
The cleric holds the Scepter, and his hands tremble slightly-not from its 
weight, but from the magnitude of what you're giving him.
"Johannes..." His voice is thick with emotion. "This is... I don't know if I'm 
worthy of-"
"That's exactly why you are," you interrupt. "Anyone who thinks 
they're unworthy of such power is precisely the person who should 
wield it. Pride and certainty are dangerous. Humility and doubt 
keep us honest."
Cyrus looks down at the Scepter, then back at you. Tears mix with the 
seawater on his face-you can see them, even here in the depths.
"You honor me beyond measure," he says quietly. "And you're right-I was 
troubled. I am troubled. The thought of calling lightning down on ships full of 
men who might be conscripts, who might have families, who might simply be 
following orders..." He closes his eyes. "It weighs on me."
"Good," you say simply. "Let it weigh on you. Let it remind you to use this 
power sparingly, carefully, only when there's no other way. That weight is 
what makes you worthy."
 
THE SANCTUM'S JUDGMENT
The presence that had faded surges back-not angry, but approving.
The water in the chamber swirls around Cyrus, around the Scepter in his 
hands. Lightning crackles along its length, but instead of the blue-white 
energy you saw, it now glows with a softer, silvery-blue light-storm tempered 
with healing, power balanced with mercy.
Words form in your minds again:
"WISDOM. THE WARRIOR RECOGNIZES HIS LIMITS. THE 
HEALER ACCEPTS THE BURDEN. BOTH UNDERSTAND: POWER 
IS NOT POSSESSION-IT IS RESPONSIBILITY."
The presence focuses on Cyrus specifically:
"CLERIC OF MISHAKAL, YOU BEAR MY STORM. WIELD IT WITH 
THE SAME CARE YOU WIELD YOUR HEALING MAGIC. 
REMEMBER: EVERY STORM MUST END. EVERY TEMPEST MUST 
GIVE WAY TO CALM. USE MY FURY TO DEFEND FREEDOM, 
THEN LET THE WATERS BE STILL AGAIN."
A final benediction:
"YOU ARE BOTH WORTHY. THE ONE WHO SEES CLEARLY. THE 
ONE WHO ACTS RIGHTLY. GO FORTH. BREAK THE CHAINS OF 
TYRANNY. SPARE WHAT YOU CAN. DESTROY WHAT YOU 
MUST."
The presence fades, leaving only the gentle current and the three of you 
standing in the sanctum.
 
AFTERMATH
Kessa breaks the silence: "Well. That was... intense." She looks between you 
and Cyrus. "You really just gave away an artifact of divine power because you 
thought someone else should have it."
You shrug. "I gave it to the person who should wield it. That's not giving it 
away-that's putting it where it belongs."
Cyrus grips the Scepter with both hands, his expression resolute despite the 
weight of responsibility. "I will honor this trust. Both yours, Johannes, and the 
goddess's. I will use this power as it should be used-to protect, to defend, to 
free. And when our purpose is fulfilled..." He looks at the Scepter thoughtfully. 
"We'll return it. Or find the next worthy bearer."
"For now," you say practically, "we have Phase 1 complete. The 
Scepter is ours-yours. Phase 2 is rescuing Lady Sharane's 
daughter from the Dragon Army flagship. Then Phase 3: dealing 
with Highlord Lucien and his fleet."
Kessa nods, back to business. "Right. One impossible task down, two to go. 
Let's get back to the Stormbreaker and plan the next move."
 
ATTUNEMENT NOTE
Cyrus will need to attune to the Tempest Scepter during a short rest. He's 
currently attuned to:
1.	Pearl of Power (1st level spell slot recovery)
2.	Amulet of the Depths (swim speed, water breathing, cold resist, speak 
with dead)
3.	Goggles of Night (darkvision 60 ft)
He'll likely un-attune from the Goggles since the Scepter provides water 
breathing for him and nearby allies (30 ft radius), making underwater 
operations easier for everyone.
 
EXITING THE TEMPLE
The three of you turn to leave the sanctum. The bronze doors remain open, 
welcoming. The guardian spirit in the main sanctuary nods as you pass-a 
gesture of respect between equals.
The drowned ones in the plaza outside continue their outward guard, 
protecting rather than threatening.
You ascend through the clear water, the temple falling away beneath you. At 
80 feet, you can see the hull of the Stormbreaker above. At 60 feet, the 
sunlight strengthens. At 40 feet, you break into full daylight.
You surface beside the ship. Captain Andra is at the rail immediately, eyes 
wide.
"You're back! And you have-" She sees the Scepter in Cyrus's hands and her 
expression shifts to awe. "By the gods. You actually did it."
Crew members help you aboard. As you stand dripping on the deck, Cyrus still 
holding the Tempest Scepter, the Stormbreaker's sailors back away slightly-
not in fear, but in reverence. They recognize divine power when they see it.
Captain Andra approaches carefully. "Commander Constantinius. Brother 
Cyrus. What are your orders?"
 
What do you do?
1.	Proceed immediately to Phase 2 - Sail to Flotsam, begin 
reconnaissance for Elara's rescue
2.	Short rest aboard ship - Let Cyrus attune to the Scepter, recover 
resources, plan carefully
3.	Report to Admiral Kethren first - Inform Ak-Thyln command of 
your success
4.	Something else?
The sun is still high-early afternoon. You have time, but the Dragon Army 
fleet deploys in 10-12 days. Every hour counts.
Actually, with what we do, the Googles are mission-critical. The Pearl is nice, 
but it's only a 1st level spell.
Dec 9
ATTUNEMENT DECISION
You're absolutely right. Cyrus considers his options as the crew gives him 
space on the deck:
Currently attuned:
1.	Pearl of Power - Recover one 1st-level spell slot per day (useful but 
limited)
2.	Amulet of the Depths - Swim speed, water breathing, cold resistance, 
Speak with Dead 1/day (extremely valuable)
3.	Goggles of Night - Darkvision 60 ft (mission-critical for operations)
The Tempest Scepter provides water breathing for bearer and allies within 
30 feet, which overlaps with the Amulet. However, the Amulet also provides 
swim speed, cold resistance, and Speak with Dead-all valuable.
The Pearl, while nice, only recovers a single 1st-level slot. Compared to the 
divine artifact in his hands, it's clearly the least essential.
Cyrus nods to himself. "I'll un-attune from the Pearl. A single first-level spell 
slot is helpful, but not worth losing access to this." He holds up the Tempest 
Scepter. "We can always sell or gift the Pearl to someone who needs it more."
Decision made: Cyrus will attune to the Tempest Scepter and un-attune 
from the Pearl of Power during the next short rest.
 
ABOARD THE STORMBREAKER
Captain Andra awaits your orders, her crew maintaining respectful distance 
from the divine artifact.
The Stormbreaker rocks gently at anchor, the sun still high in the early 
afternoon sky. You've successfully completed Phase 1-arguably the most 
uncertain part of the operation. You have the weapon that can destroy the 
Dragon Army fleet.
Now comes Phase 2: Rescuing Elara, Lady Sharane's daughter, from the 
Dragon Army flagship in Flotsam harbor.
Current status:
*	Timeline: 10-12 days until Dragon Army fleet deploys
*	Location: Sunken Temple of Zeboim, ~40 miles from Flotsam
*	Party condition: Full HP, most spell slots available (you used no 
resources in the temple)
*	Mission progress: Phase 1 complete, Phase 2 and 3 remain
Options:
1. Proceed immediately to Flotsam
*	Sail directly to the port city
*	Begin reconnaissance for Elara's rescue
*	No rest, maintain momentum
*	Travel time: ~6-8 hours depending on winds
2. Short rest aboard ship first
*	Let Cyrus attune to the Scepter (1 hour)
*	Recover any resources, plan Phase 2 in detail
*	Sail to Flotsam afterward
*	Still arrive tonight or early tomorrow
3. Report to Admiral Kethren in Ak-Thyln
*	Inform command of your success
*	Get any updated intelligence on Flotsam/Dragon Army
*	Significant detour (adds 1-2 days)
*	Probably unnecessary
4. Anchor here and plan extensively
*	Full long rest if needed
*	Detailed planning session for Phase 2
*	Approach Flotsam fully prepared
*	Most cautious option
 
What's your call?
I'd recommend Option 2 - take a short rest to let Cyrus attune and discuss 
Phase 2 strategy, then sail to Flotsam. You'll arrive tonight under cover of 
darkness, perfect for reconnaissance. You don't need to report back to Ak-
Thyln yet-you have the Scepter and a mission to complete.
What do you want to do?
We keep the Pearl. The expectation is that our possession of the Scepter is 
temporary. Once it is returned, it would make sense to re-attune to the Pearl. 
Actually, let's do 1. Why wait when the ship can be travelling while we rest, 
etc.?
Dec 9
SETTING SAIL FOR FLOTSAM
You're right-no reason to waste time anchored when you can rest while 
traveling.
"Captain Andra," you call out. "Set course for Flotsam. We'll rest and plan en 
route."
She nods crisply. "Aye, Commander. We'll make good time with the current 
winds. Should reach Flotsam harbor by nightfall, maybe earlier." She turns to 
her crew. "Weigh anchor! Prepare to make sail! Helmsman, set course 
northeast by east!"
The Stormbreaker comes alive with activity. Sailors scramble up the rigging, 
canvas unfurls, and within minutes the ship is cutting through the waves 
toward Flotsam.
 
SHORT REST EN ROUTE
Captain Andra provides you with her cabin for privacy-a courtesy for the 
operation's command element. The three of you settle in: Cyrus sits cross-
legged with the Tempest Scepter across his lap, beginning the attunement 
process. Kessa sprawls in a chair, finally relaxing after the tension of the 
temple. You lean against the bulkhead, feeling the ship's steady rhythm.
Cyrus's Attunement (1 hour):
The cleric breathes slowly, deeply, his hands resting on the Scepter. You watch 
as the artifact's energy begins to resonate with him-lightning flickering along 
its length in time with his heartbeat, storm essence recognizing and accepting 
its new bearer.
His holy symbol of Mishakal glows faintly in response, divine energies 
intertwining: healing and tempest, mercy and fury, calm and storm. Not 
opposing forces, but complementary ones.
After an hour, Cyrus opens his eyes. They briefly flash with storm-light before 
returning to normal.
"It's done," he says quietly. "I can feel it-the power, the responsibility, the 
goddess's trust." He looks at the Scepter with something like reverence. "This 
is... humbling."
Attunement complete:
*	Cyrus: Pearl of Power, Amulet of the Depths, Tempest Scepter
*	Pearl remains for re-attunement after the Scepter is returned
 
PLANNING PHASE 2: ELARA'S RESCUE
With attunement complete and the ship making steady progress toward 
Flotsam, you spread out what intelligence you have.
What you know about the situation:
The Target: Elara
*	Daughter of Lady Sharane (resistance ally/supporter in Flotsam region)
*	Captured by Dragon Army ~2 weeks ago
*	Held aboard the flagship Tiamat's Wrath as leverage/hostage
*	Age unknown, condition unknown, exact location on ship unknown
The Location: Flotsam Harbor
*	Major port city, currently under Dragon Army control (occupied, not 
fully garrisoned)
*	Harbor contains the Dragon Army fleet: 15 warships including the 
flagship
*	Tiamat's Wrath is the command vessel-largest, most heavily guarded
*	Fleet is preparing to deploy in 10-12 days
The Opposition: Highlord Lucien
*	Commands the fleet and occupation forces
*	High-ranking Dragon Army officer (Highlord = major commander)
*	Powerful combatant (exact capabilities unknown)
*	Based aboard Tiamat's Wrath
*	Likely has elite guards, officers, mages
Haven Intelligence Network:
*	Contact in Flotsam: "The Fishwife" (tavern owner, resistance 
sympathizer)
*	Can provide local intelligence, safe house, current disposition
*	Network has been monitoring Dragon Army movements
Your Assets:
*	Stormbreaker and Captain Andra's crew (naval support)
*	Tempest Scepter (ultimate weapon for Phase 3)
*	Your party's skills: stealth, combat, magic
*	Element of surprise (Dragon Army doesn't know you're coming)
 
STRATEGIC DISCUSSION
Kessa leans forward, studying the rough map of Flotsam harbor that Captain 
Andra provided. "Okay, so we need to get Elara off a heavily guarded flagship 
in an occupied harbor without alerting the entire Dragon Army fleet. Simple."
Her tone is dry, but you can see her mind working-she's already thinking 
through approaches.
Cyrus strokes his beard thoughtfully. "The key question is: do we attempt 
stealth, or do we use the Scepter as leverage?"
"What do you mean?" you ask.
"Well," Cyrus gestures with the Scepter, "we could sneak aboard, find Elara, 
extract her quietly. Classic infiltration. But we could 
also announce ourselves-show Lucien we have the weapon he covets, offer a 
trade: Elara for safe passage. Or threaten to destroy his fleet if he doesn't 
release her."
Kessa shakes her head. "That second option gives him time to prepare, to set 
traps, to use Elara as a shield. And it tells him we have the Scepter, which 
might make Phase 3 harder."
"True," Cyrus concedes. "But stealth has its own risks. If we're caught aboard 
the flagship, we're trapped in the heart of enemy forces with no easy escape."
 
APPROACH OPTIONS
Option A: Full Stealth Infiltration
*	Reconnaissance first via "The Fishwife" contact
*	Nighttime approach (you have Devil's Sight, Kessa has darkvision, Cyrus 
has Goggles)
*	Board Tiamat's Wrath covertly
*	Locate Elara, extract her, escape before alarm raised
*	Pros: Maintains surprise for Phase 3, clean operation if successful
*	Cons: High risk if discovered, unknown ship layout, Elara's location 
uncertain
Option B: Negotiation/Intimidation
*	Approach openly with Scepter
*	Demand Elara's release, threaten fleet destruction
*	Force Lucien to choose between his hostage and his mission
*	Pros: Direct, forces enemy response, might avoid combat entirely
*	Cons: Reveals Scepter possession, gives enemy time to prepare, might 
trigger hostage execution
Option C: Distraction + Extraction
*	Create major diversion elsewhere in harbor (fire, explosion, false attack)
*	Dragon Army responds to threat
*	Infiltrate flagship while defenses are weakened/distracted
*	Pros: Reduces guards on flagship, creates confusion
*	Cons: Requires precise timing, might harm innocents, still requires 
successful infiltration
Option D: Intelligence First
*	Make contact with "The Fishwife" immediately upon arrival
*	Gather detailed information before committing to approach
*	Adapt plan based on current situation
*	Pros: Most informed decision, flexible response
*	Cons: Takes time, relies on local assets
Option E: Something else?
 
Kessa waits for your input. "You're the tactical mind here, Johannes. What's 
your read?"
Cyrus adds: "And remember-we also need to consider Phase 3. How we 
extract Elara may impact our ability to destroy the fleet afterward. If we reveal 
the Scepter now, they'll be watching for its use later."
The Stormbreaker cuts through the waves, carrying you steadily toward 
Flotsam. You have maybe 4-5 hours before you arrive-time to plan, but not 
unlimited time.
What's your approach?
Let's see if we can find someone intimately familiar with the design of Tiamat's 
Wrath, or similar ships, who can help us understand exactly where we might 
expect to find Elara, and so we can plan how best to enter the ship and exit it 
without alarm.
Dec 9
SEEKING EXPERT KNOWLEDGE
"Before we commit to any approach," you say, "we need better intelligence. 
Specifically, we need someone who knows the layout of Tiamat's Wrath-or at 
least ships of similar design. Where prisoners would be held, where the 
command deck is, entry points, patrol patterns. Going in blind is asking for 
failure."
Kessa nods approvingly. "Smart. Know the terrain before you fight on it."
Cyrus stands. "Let me speak with Captain Andra. She's a naval officer-she 
might know the ship's design, or at least know someone who does."
 
CONSULTING CAPTAIN ANDRA
The three of you head back on deck. The Stormbreaker is making excellent 
time, sails full, spray kicking up from the bow. Captain Andra is at the helm, 
conferring with her navigator.
"Captain," you call out. "We need your expertise."
She turns, immediately attentive. "Commander?"
"We need detailed information about Tiamat's Wrath-the Dragon Army 
flagship. Ship layout, likely prisoner locations, security patterns. Do you know 
the vessel, or know someone who would?"
Andra's expression sharpens with professional interest. She thinks for a 
moment, then nods decisively.
"I know of her. She's a converted war galley-originally built in Ergoth about 
fifteen years ago as the Sea Sovereign. The Dragon Army captured her three 
years back, refitted and renamed her. She's not Dragon Army design-she's 
repurposed from the merchant marine."
She gestures for you to follow her to the chart table. "That's actually good news 
for you. Dragon Army ships are purpose-built fortresses. But Tiamat's 
Wrath started life as a merchant-military hybrid, which means her design is 
more... conventional."
"Meaning?" Kessa prompts.
"Meaning I can make educated guesses about her layout based on standard 
Ergothian war galley design. And more importantly..." Andra grins slightly. 
"My first mate, Korvan, served aboard the Sea Sovereign for two years before 
the Dragon Army took her. He knows that ship intimately-every deck, every 
compartment, every weakness."
 
MEETING FIRST MATE KORVAN
Andra calls out: "Korvan! To the chart table, if you please!"
A weathered sailor approaches-perhaps fifty years old, with the bearing of 
someone who's spent his entire life at sea. He has a pronounced limp, and you 
notice his left hand is missing two fingers. War wounds, perhaps, or just the 
price of a life on the water.
"Captain?" His voice is gravelly but respectful.
"Commander Constantinius needs information about the Sea Sovereign-now 
called Tiamat's Wrath. You served aboard her, didn't you?"
Korvan's expression darkens. "Aye, Captain. Two years, before the Dragon 
bastards took her at Kalaman. Lost good friends in that fight." He looks at you 
directly. "Why do you need to know about her?"
You meet his gaze. "We're extracting a hostage from aboard her. Dragon Army 
is holding an innocent woman-using her as leverage against her family. We 
need to know the ship's layout to get her out alive."
Korvan studies you for a long moment, then nods slowly. "Then I'll tell you 
everything I know. That ship was my home once. Seeing her fly Dragon Army 
colors..." He spits over the rail. "It's a fucking insult. If I can help take 
something back from them, all the better."
 
KORVAN'S INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING
The first mate pulls out parchment and begins sketching from memory. His 
knowledge is detailed and precise-this man knows his ship.
SHIP LAYOUT - TIAMAT'S WRATH (formerly SEA SOVEREIGN)
Basic Stats:
*	Length: ~150 feet
*	Beam: ~40 feet
*	Three masts (main, fore, mizzen)
*	Two decks below main deck
*	Crew complement: ~200 sailors/marines in Dragon Army service
*	Armament: 20 ballistae, various catapults
MAIN DECK:
*	Command deck at stern (wheel, captain's cabin, officer quarters)
*	Open deck for sail operations and fighting
*	Main hatches leading below
*	Two entrances to below decks: fore and aft companionways
UPPER GUN DECK (First Deck Below):
*	Ballista positions along both sides
*	Crew quarters (hammocks, tight spaces)
*	Galley and mess area
*	Armory
*	Officer cabins along the stern (this is important)
LOWER DECK (Second Deck Below):
*	Cargo hold
*	Brig - Prison cells, typically 4-6 cells in Ergothian design
*	Water and food stores
*	Bilge access
*	Only two ways down: Main ladder amidships, or smaller ladder near 
stern
Korvan taps the brig location. "If they're holding a hostage-someone they 
want to keep alive and controlled-the brig is the most likely location. It's 
secure, below the waterline, hard to access, easy to guard. Typically has one or 
two guards posted at all times, more if they're expecting trouble."
 
SECURITY ASSESSMENT
Kessa leans in, studying the sketch. "Entry points?"
Korvan marks several locations:
1. Main Deck Entry:
*	"Boarding gangway when in port-heavily guarded, visible, worst option 
for stealth"
2. Stern Windows:
*	"Captain's cabin and officer quarters have windows-small, but 
accessible from the water"
*	"Could climb up or use magic to enter. Less guarded but still risky-
officers are inside"
3. Gun Ports:
*	"Ballista ports are too small for human entry, maybe a halfling could 
squeeze through"
*	"They're also on the upper gun deck-you'd have to get past crew 
quarters to reach the lower deck"
4. Anchor Chain Access:
*	"There's a hawsehole at the bow where the anchor chain feeds through. 
Opens directly to the lower deck"
*	"It's tight, it's nasty, it's covered in barnacles and shit, but 
it's unguarded"
*	"No one expects infiltration through the anchor chain. It's a 
maintenance access, not a door"
5. Rudder Access:
*	"At the stern, underwater, there's a small service hatch for rudder 
maintenance"
*	"Opens into the lowest deck, near the brig actually"
*	"Requires underwater approach, difficult to open from outside, but 
possible with the right tools"
Kessa's eyes light up. "The rudder hatch. That puts us directly near the brig?"
"Close enough," Korvan confirms. "You'd emerge in the aft section of the lower 
deck. Brig is maybe thirty feet forward. One or two corners to navigate, but 
direct access."
 
GUARD PATTERNS
Cyrus asks the critical question: "What about guards? Patrol patterns?"
Korvan grimaces. "That I can't tell you with certainty-Dragon Army might 
have changed things. But based on standard naval practice:"
Night Watch (Most likely time for infiltration):
*	Main deck: 10-15 guards on watch, plus officer of the deck
*	Upper gun deck: Skeleton crew, most sailors sleeping
*	Lower deck: 2 guards at the brig, maybe one roving patrol
*	Officer quarters: Officers present, light sleepers
*	Total alert crew: ~30-40 at any given time at night
*	Full complement available: 200+ if alarm is raised
"The good news," Korvan adds, "is that most of those 200 are regular sailors 
and Dragon Army conscripts, not elite soldiers. But the bad news is there's 
a lot of them, and once the alarm goes up, you're trapped on a ship with 
nowhere to run."
 
ESCAPE CONSIDERATIONS
"Extraction is the hard part," Korvan says grimly. "Getting in is one thing. 
Getting out with a hostage while the entire ship hunts you? That's another 
matter entirely."
He points to the sketch. "Your best bet is a pre-positioned escape. Have a boat 
ready at the waterline-maybe at the stern, hidden in the shadow of the hull. 
Enter through the rudder hatch, get the hostage, exit the same way, drop into 
the boat, and row like hell before they realize what happened."
"Or," Kessa suggests, "we have someone create a diversion elsewhere in the 
harbor. Draw attention away from Tiamat's Wrath during our escape."
Cyrus looks thoughtful. "Or we use magic. Dimension Door could teleport us 
off the ship directly-500 feet range. If we had a Scroll or if someone could 
cast it..."
You consider. You have two Dimension Door scrolls, actually. Emergency 
escape options.
 
ELARA'S LIKELY LOCATION
Korvan taps the brig again. "If she's a hostage-valuable, meant to be kept 
alive-she's in the brig. That's the secure location. However..."
He pauses, considering.
"If Highlord Lucien is keeping her close for interrogation, leverage, or 
personal reasons, she might be in officer quarters on the upper gun deck. 
That's less secure but closer to command authority. It depends on how he's 
using her."
"How do we find out?" you ask.
"Your contact in Flotsam-'The Fishwife'-might know. Local resistance would 
be watching the flagship, gathering intelligence. They might have seen her 
moved, or have informants among the dock workers."
 
CURRENT ASSESSMENT
You now have detailed intelligence on Tiamat's Wrath:
Most Likely Hostage Location: Brig (lower deck, aft section) 
Best Entry Point: Rudder hatch (underwater, stern, opens near brig) 
Best Escape: Pre-positioned boat + Dimension Door scroll as backup 
Timing: Night infiltration, minimal crew alert 
Risk Factor: High if alarm raised; manageable if stealth maintained
Outstanding Questions:
1.	Elara's exact location (brig vs. officer quarters)
2.	Current guard strength and patterns (confirm via local intelligence)
3.	Whether Highlord Lucien is aboard (affects risk level)
4.	Harbor traffic and patrol boats (external security)
 
ARRIVAL TIMELINE
Captain Andra checks the sun's position. "We'll reach Flotsam in about three 
hours-early evening. You'll want to make contact with your informant after 
dark, I'd imagine. Less attention."
Your options:
1. Anchor offshore, wait for nightfall
*	Approach Flotsam harbor after dark
*	Make contact with "The Fishwife" under cover of darkness
*	Gather final intelligence before operation
*	Earliest possible infiltration: Tonight
2. Enter harbor openly at dusk
*	Stormbreaker poses as merchant vessel
*	Blend in with harbor traffic
*	Easier contact with informant
*	Slightly more exposure
3. Drop you off via small boat before entering harbor
*	Stormbreaker stays offshore
*	You infiltrate Flotsam separately on foot/small craft
*	Maximum stealth, no ship exposure
*	Harder logistics
 
What's your plan?
You have ship layout, entry point identified (rudder hatch), and general 
approach. Now you need to finalize operational details and decide on arrival 
method.
What do you want to do?
From what we heard during our brief, the Highlord is keeping Elara in his 
quarters, since she is a hostage to keep one of Flotsam's powerful merchants 
in hand. He wouldn't risk putting her in substandard quarters and expect 
compliance. So that helps.
But I need to ask a fairly strange question, but hear me out. What is the 
situation when it comes to lavatories and such on board? How is that handled, 
especially in the captain's quarters?
Dec 9
AN EXCELLENT QUESTION
Korvan blinks at your question, then actually grins-the first time you've seen 
him smile. "Commander, that's not strange at all. That's smart. Most people 
think about doors and windows. They don't think about shit."
Captain Andra nods approvingly. "Sanitation access points are the weakest 
security on any ship. No one wants to guard the privy."
Korvan leans over his sketch, adding details:
 
SHIP SANITATION SYSTEMS
For Regular Crew: "Most sailors use the 'head'-that's the forward part of 
the ship, near the bow. Open-air seats suspended over the water. You do your 
business, it drops straight into the sea. Whole crew shares them, no privacy, 
just how it is."
For Officers (Upper Gun Deck): "Officer quarters have shared facilities-
small enclosed room with seats over discharge chutes. Still drops to the sea, 
but more private, better maintained."
For the Captain (Main Deck, Stern): Korvan taps the sketch of the 
captain's quarters. "Now this is relevant to you. The captain's cabin-and 
on Tiamat's Wrath, that's where Highlord Lucien would be-has a private 
privy."
He sketches it out:
"It's a small enclosed room, attached to the main cabin. Maybe 4 feet by 6 feet. 
Has a proper seat-basically a bench with a hole cut in it. The hole connects to 
a discharge chute that runs down the outside of the stern hull and opens about 
6 feet above the waterline."
"So it's basically a shaft from the captain's quarters straight to the 
outside?" Kessa asks, her professional interest clearly piqued.
"Exactly. And here's the thing-it's unguarded. Why would you guard a shit 
chute? It's narrow, it's disgusting, and most people can't fit through it 
anyway."
"How narrow?" you ask.
Korvan considers. "The chute itself? Maybe 18 inches wide, 24 inches deep. 
Rectangular opening. A large man in armor couldn't fit. But someone slim, 
flexible, willing to get filthy..." He looks at Kessa meaningfully. "Someone like 
a rogue? Could absolutely squeeze through."
 
THE TACTICAL OPPORTUNITY
Kessa is already working through the logistics. "So if we approach underwater, 
climb the stern, I could enter through the discharge chute, emerge in the 
captain's privy, and I'm literally inside Lucien's quarters?"
"Assuming he's using the captain's cabin, yes," Korvan confirms. "And if he's 
keeping a high-value hostage close for leverage, he'd keep her in the captain's 
quarters or the adjacent officer cabin. They're connected-there's an internal 
door."
He sketches the layout more clearly:
CAPTAIN'S QUARTERS (Stern, Main Deck):
*	Main cabin: ~20 feet by 30 feet (large, well-appointed)
*	Private privy: Small enclosed room, 4x6 feet
*	Connected to adjacent officer cabin via internal door
*	External entrance: Main door to the deck (guarded)
*	Windows: Three large stern windows (could be watched from 
inside/outside)
"So Elara might be in the main cabin with Lucien, or she might be 
in the adjacent officer cabin," Cyrus reasons. "Either way, Kessa entering 
through the privy puts her inside the secured area."
 
CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS
Korvan holds up a hand. "Before you get too excited, there are complications:"
1. The Discharge Chute Access:
*	Opens 6 feet above waterline-you need to climb wet hull to reach it
*	Opening faces aft-visible to any ships behind Tiamat's Wrath
*	Chute is designed for discharge, not entry-there may be a grate or 
cover
*	It's going to be disgusting-waste residue, smell, potential slippage
2. Inside the Privy:
*	Small, enclosed space
*	Door to main cabin-may be locked from outside, may creak, may be 
heard
*	If Lucien or guards are in the main cabin when you emerge, you're 
trapped
*	No room to maneuver or fight
3. The Hostage Situation:
*	If Elara is in the main cabin with Lucien, you'll need to deal with him
*	If she's in the adjacent officer cabin, you need to get her out quietly
*	She may be bound, gagged, drugged, or traumatized-not ready for 
immediate escape
*	She doesn't know you're coming-may not trust you immediately
4. Escape Route:
*	Same way you came in is difficult with a hostage
*	Alternative: The stern windows (but they're visible, noisy to break)
*	Or: Fight your way to the main door and escape through the ship (high 
risk)
 
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT
The rogue studies the sketch, running scenarios. "It's doable, but it's tight. If I 
go in alone through the chute, I can assess the situation-find Elara, 
determine guard presence, unlock windows or doors for the rest of you. But if 
things go wrong, I'm trapped in a small room with limited options."
She looks at you. "What if we combine approaches? I infiltrate through the 
privy chute. You and Cyrus approach via the rudder hatch, make your way up 
to the officer quarters from below. That way if I run into trouble, you're in 
position to support. And if I succeed quietly, I can let you in through the 
internal door."
Cyrus nods slowly. "A two-pronged infiltration. More complex, but more 
redundancy. If one approach fails, the other might still succeed."
 
IMPROVED OPERATIONAL PLAN
Based on this intelligence, here's a refined approach:
Phase A: Infiltration (Simultaneous)
*	Kessa: Underwater approach, climb stern hull, enter via discharge 
chute, emerge in privy
*	Johannes & Cyrus: Underwater approach, enter via rudder hatch, 
ascend from lower deck to upper gun deck, position near officer quarters
Phase B: Reconnaissance
*	Kessa: Scout captain's quarters and adjacent cabin, locate Elara
*	Johannes & Cyrus: Hold position, ready to support if alarm raised
Phase C: Extraction
*	Kessa: If Elara is in adjacent cabin and lightly guarded, attempt quiet 
extraction
*	Johannes & Cyrus: Provide escape route or backup if needed
*	Combined: If Lucien is present or heavily guarded, coordinate assault 
or retreat
Phase D: Escape
*	Best case: Exit via stern windows (pre-broken/unlocked by Kessa) to 
waiting boat
*	Backup: Dimension Door scroll to teleport off ship
*	Emergency: Fight to upper deck, dive overboard, swim to extraction 
point
 
REMAINING QUESTIONS
1. Is Highlord Lucien currently aboard?
*	If he's ashore, infiltration is easier
*	If he's aboard, you may need to deal with him directly
*	"The Fishwife" intelligence should confirm
2. Guard presence in captain's quarters?
*	How many guards outside the door?
*	Are there guards inside with Elara?
*	Night watch strength?
3. Harbor security?
*	Patrol boats?
*	Dockside sentries?
*	Other Dragon Army vessels nearby?
4. Elara's condition?
*	Can she move under her own power?
*	Will she recognize friendly forces?
*	Does she need medical attention?
All of these questions can hopefully be answered by your contact in Flotsam.
 
Captain Andra checks the horizon. "We're about two hours from Flotsam 
now. I recommend we anchor offshore after dark, send you in via small boat. 
The Stormbreaker attracts too much attention in an occupied harbor."
She looks at you seriously. "This is a good plan, Commander. Unconventional 
entry point, two-pronged approach, multiple escape options. But it's still 
incredibly dangerous. You're infiltrating a flagship in an occupied harbor to 
extract a hostage from the personal quarters of a Dragon Army Highlord."
Kessa grins. "So, a normal Tuesday for us."
Cyrus is less flippant. "We'll need Zeboim's blessing and Mishakal's grace 
both. But yes-this is the best approach I can see."
 
Your final decisions before arrival:
1.	Confirm approach: Anchor offshore, infiltrate via small boat after 
dark?
2.	Make contact with "The Fishwife" first to gather final intelligence?
3.	Any equipment or preparation needed before the operation 
begins?
The sun is lowering toward the horizon. Within two hours, you'll be at 
Flotsam, and Phase 2 will begin in earnest.
What do you want to do?
Quick question: Does anyone have the Rope of Entanglement attuned?
Dec 9
INVENTORY CHECK - ROPE OF 
ENTANGLEMENT
Good question. Let me check the party's current attunements:
JOHANNES:
1.	Ring of Mind Shielding (attuned)
2.	Amulet of Health (attuned)
3.	Trident of Warning (attuned)
KESSA:
1.	Bracers of Defense (attuned)
2.	(Open slot)
3.	(Open slot)
CYRUS:
1.	Pearl of Power (attuned)
2.	Amulet of the Depths (attuned)
3.	Goggles of Night (attuned)
ROPE OF ENTANGLEMENT STATUS: Looking back through the loot 
from Velthrax's hoard (the green dragon), the Rope of Entanglement was 
acquired but I don't see it specifically attuned to anyone. It requires 
attunement to use its magical restraining properties.
The Rope of Entanglement (requires attunement):
*	30 feet of rope
*	As an action, command it to entangle a creature within 20 feet
*	Target must make DC 15 DEX save or become restrained
*	Can also be used to create difficult terrain
*	Useful for subduing targets without killing them
This could be perfect for the mission - if you need to quietly restrain 
guards or even Lucien himself without lethal force.
Kessa has two open attunement slots. She could attune to:
*	The Rope of Entanglement (excellent for this stealth/extraction 
mission)
*	Something else?
The Rope would be particularly useful given your emphasis on sparing lives 
where possible. You could restrain guards silently rather than killing them.
Do you want Kessa to attune to the Rope of Entanglement during 
this rest period? She has time before you reach Flotsam.
Yes, this is perfect for her. She uses the Rope to ascend the chute (addresses 
the 6 foot spacing and avoid having to work too hard to ascend. Once she is 
in, she can open the window and use the Rope to let us join her in the 
quarters, rather than having to try and make our way through the rest of the 
ship, especially if she can stay in the "can" while the rope helps us up. It also 
provides us an exit without doing anything. Two things we need to get before 
we do this: some kind of token identifier that we can use to convince Elara to 
trust us, and some kind of sleep grenade that Kessa could use to incapacitate 
anyone in the quarters before she leaves the lavatory to avoid alarms. If that 
includes Elara, all the easier.
Dec 9
REFINED PLAN - EXCELLENT THINKING
You lay out the improved approach, and both Kessa and Cyrus nod with 
growing approval.
"The Rope solves multiple problems," Kessa says, already pulling it 
from the equipment pack. She begins the attunement process immediately-
sitting cross-legged, focusing on the magical rope as it coils around her 
forearm. "Climbing aid, entry tool, and extraction method all in one. 
Plus restraining anyone we need to subdue non-lethally."
Cyrus strokes his beard. "And having Kessa open the window from inside 
means Johannes and I don't have to navigate the entire ship. We approach 
underwater, wait at the stern, she lets us in directly. Much cleaner."
"Exactly," you confirm. "But we need two things before we go: First, 
something that proves to Elara we're allies of her mother-a token, 
a phrase, something that makes her trust us immediately. Second, 
some kind of alchemical sleep agent Kessa can deploy in the 
quarters to incapacitate everyone quietly before she even leaves the 
privy."
 
OBTAINING THE TOKEN
Captain Andra considers. "The token is straightforward. 'The Fishwife' in 
Flotsam should be able to provide that-she's your Haven contact, and Lady 
Sharane would have given the resistance network something specific for 
identification. A family signet ring, a code phrase, a personal detail only 
Sharane would know. That's intelligence you gather when you make contact."
Cyrus adds: "We could also send a message to Haven directly-ask Laurana to 
reach out to Lady Sharane for a proper authentication token. Your Sending 
Stone can reach Haven, correct?"
You nod. The Sending Stone paired with Laurana could handle that. Though it 
would take time for Laurana to contact Sharane and relay the information 
back.
"The Fishwife is faster," you decide. "She's local, she's connected to 
Sharane's network. We get the token when we make contact 
tonight."
 
THE SLEEP AGENT - MORE COMPLEX
The alchemical incapacitant is trickier.
Kessa frowns thoughtfully. "I'm not an alchemist. I know poisons, but sleep 
agents that work instantly and safely? That's specialized work."
Cyrus shakes his head. "I could cast Sleep, but it's verbal, requires gestures, 
and has limited range. It wouldn't work from inside the privy before anyone 
sees me. And it affects creatures based on hit points-against high-level 
targets like Lucien, it might not work at all."
Captain Andra taps the table. "What you're describing sounds like Essence of 
Ether-alchemical sleep gas. Rare, expensive, and difficult to make. I don't 
carry it aboard the Stormbreaker."
"Where would we get it?" Kessa asks.
"Flotsam has black market alchemists," Andra says. "It's a port city-
smugglers, criminals, underground trade. If anyone has Essence of Ether or 
something similar, it would be there. Your contact might know a supplier."
 
ALTERNATIVE: MAGICAL SOLUTIONS
Cyrus considers alternatives: "I don't have access to Sleep as a spell anymore 
at our level-it's too weak. But there are other options..."
He counts on his fingers:
1. Hold Person (2nd-level spell):
*	Paralyzes humanoid target
*	Requires concentration, verbal/somatic components
*	WIS save to resist (DC 15)
*	Single target only
*	Not subtle-casting would be noticed
2. Silence (2nd-level spell, Ritual):
*	Creates 20-foot radius of magical silence
*	Could prevent alarm from being raised
*	Doesn't incapacitate-just prevents sound
*	Useful for keeping combat quiet, not for subduing
3. Command (1st-level spell):
*	One-word command to single creature
*	"Sleep" is a valid command
*	WIS save to resist (DC 15)
*	Only lasts one round (6 seconds)
*	Not effective for sustained incapacitation
None of these are perfect for "quietly incapacitate everyone in the room before 
they know you're there."
 
KESSA'S PROFESSIONAL INPUT
The rogue finishes attuning to the Rope and looks up. "Here's the thing-I'm 
good at killing people quietly. I'm decent at restraining people quietly if I get 
the drop on them. But putting multiple people to sleep simultaneously without 
them noticing? That's not really in my skillset."
She pauses, thinking tactically.
"What if we approach this differently? Instead of trying to incapacitate 
everyone at once, what if I scout first? I enter through the chute, stay in the 
privy, listen. If the quarters are empty except for Elara, I signal you through 
the window. If there are guards or Lucien is present, I wait for them to leave or 
sleep naturally."
"That could take hours," you point out. "Or might not happen at all if 
Lucien stays in his quarters all night."
"True," Kessa concedes. "But it's lower risk than trying to alchemically knock 
out a Dragon Army Highlord and hoping it works before he raises the alarm."
 
PRACTICAL ASSESSMENT
Korvan, who's been listening quietly, speaks up: "Commander, in my 
experience, the best infiltrations are the ones where you don't have to fight at 
all. You want to avoid the enemy entirely, not subdue them."
He taps the sketch. "What if Elara isn't in the captain's quarters with Lucien? 
What if she's in the adjacent officer cabin-locked in, maybe a single guard? 
That's much easier to handle quietly. One guard can be dealt with silently. The 
Rope can restrain them. Then you extract Elara without ever entering the 
main cabin where Lucien might be."
"But if she IS in the main cabin with Lucien?" Cyrus asks.
Korvan shrugs. "Then you adapt. Maybe Kessa uses the Rope to restrain him 
while he sleeps. Maybe you wait until he leaves. Maybe you accept that this 
becomes a combat situation and use your Dimension Door scroll to extract 
immediately after grabbing Elara."
 
DECISION POINT: SLEEP AGENT
You have a few options:
Option A: Seek Essence of Ether in Flotsam
*	Ask "The Fishwife" for a black market alchemist contact
*	Purchase sleep gas (expensive, maybe 500-1000gp, possibly 
unavailable)
*	Delays operation by several hours minimum
*	If available, gives you instant-incapacitation option
Option B: Use existing tools (Rope, stealth, magic)
*	Kessa scouts via privy entrance
*	Assess situation before committing
*	Use Rope to restrain guards/targets silently
*	Accept that this might become combat if necessary
*	Faster, more flexible, relies on your existing skills
Option C: Magical solution from Cyrus
*	Silence spell to prevent alarm during extraction
*	Command or Hold Person for single-target control
*	Not perfect, but workable
*	Requires Cyrus to be present/close
Option D: Wait for optimal timing
*	Observe the flagship for 1-2 days
*	Learn patrol patterns, when Lucien leaves quarters, when Elara is alone
*	Most patient approach, highest chance of clean extraction
*	Costs time (fleet deploys in 10-12 days, you have some buffer)
 
RECOMMENDATION
Captain Andra offers her tactical assessment: "Commander, trying to acquire 
specialized alchemical agents in an occupied city on short notice is risky. You 
might not find them, they might be low quality, or the search itself might 
attract attention."
She gestures to your party. "You have a master infiltrator with magical 
restraint tools, a warlock with powerful magic, and a cleric with divine 
support. You've planned a good entry point and escape route. I'd recommend 
you use what you have rather than chasing a perfect solution that might not 
exist."
Cyrus nods agreement. "Wisdom suggests we gather intelligence from 'The 
Fishwife' first-learn Elara's exact location, whether Lucien is aboard, guard 
strength. Then we decide if we can extract her quietly, or if we need to wait for 
better timing."
Kessa shrugs. "I'm good either way. If we can get sleep gas, great-I'll use it. If 
not, I'll work with the Rope and my daggers. I've done harder extractions with 
less."
 
What's your call?
1.	Seek sleep agent in Flotsam (adds time, might not succeed)
2.	Proceed with existing tools (Rope, magic, stealth, adapting to 
situation)
3.	Gather intel first, decide after speaking with "The Fishwife"
4.	Something else?
The sun is lowering. You're maybe 90 minutes from Flotsam now. Time to 
finalize the approach.
I feel best about having something that is odorless and area of effect, that can 
be used without exposing the user to the effect. Does Kessa have access to 
Mage Hand? She could use the hand to deliver the knockout gas without 
having to leave the lavatory.
Dec 9
KESSA'S CAPABILITIES CHECK
You turn to Kessa. "Do you have access to Mage Hand? If we could get the 
sleep gas, you could use the hand to deploy it from the privy without exposing 
yourself or having to enter the room."
Kessa shakes her head. "No, I don't have Mage Hand. I'm College of Lore-I 
picked up some extra magical secrets, but cantrips weren't part of that. My 
spell list is pretty limited: Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Faerie Fire, Hideous 
Laughter..." She counts them off. "Useful for support and control, but 
no Mage Hand."
Cyrus considers. "I don't have Mage Hand either. My cantrips are Sacred 
Flame, Spare the Dying, Thaumaturgy, and Guidance. None of which help 
with deploying alchemical agents remotely."
You have Mage Hand as a warlock cantrip. That's part of your standard 
spell list. But you wouldn't be in the privy-Kessa would be. You'd be 
approaching from underwater at the stern.
 
TACTICAL PROBLEM
The issue becomes clear:
Kessa enters via the discharge chute, positions in the privy, but has no way to 
deploy gas remotely without exposing herself.
Johannes (you) could deploy gas remotely with Mage Hand, but you're not 
inside yet-you're waiting for Kessa to open the stern windows.
Timing challenge: If you wait for Kessa to let you in through the window, 
and then you deploy gas via Mage Hand, anyone in the quarters might see you 
climbing through the window before the gas takes effect.
 
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
Korvan, following the discussion, offers a thought: "What if you both enter 
through the stern windows at the same time? Forget the privy entrance-just 
have Kessa climb up the hull to the windows, force them open quietly, and you 
both enter together. Then Johannes uses Mage Hand to deploy the gas 
immediately upon entry."
Kessa considers. "That works if the windows aren't locked or barred. But if 
they are, I'd need tools and time to force them, which might make noise. The 
privy chute is guaranteed entry-unguarded, unlocked, accessible."
Cyrus suggests: "What if Kessa enters via the privy, immediately opens the 
window from inside-quietly, carefully-then Johannes climbs in and 
uses Mage Hand to deploy the gas? The sequence would be: Kessa enters 
privy, unlocks/opens window, Johannes enters through window, Johannes 
deploys gas via Mage Hand, gas takes effect."
"How fast does this sleep gas work?" you ask practically.
Captain Andra shakes her head. "That's the problem-I don't know. I'm not an 
alchemist. Essence of Ether supposedly works within seconds to a minute 
depending on concentration and ventilation. But I've never used it personally."
 
THE REALISTIC ASSESSMENT
Kessa leans back, thinking tactically. "Here's the truth: any alchemical sleep 
agent has variables we can't control. Deployment time, effect time, whether it 
works on high-level targets like Lucien, whether the room is well-ventilated 
enough for it to disperse, whether Elara has an adverse reaction..."
She looks at you directly. "I trust my skills more than I trust unknown 
alchemy. Give me the Rope of Entanglement, let me scout through the privy, 
and if I find a single guard I can restrain them silently. If I find Lucien asleep, 
I can restrain him before he wakes. If I find a room full of alert enemies... then 
we adapt or retreat."
Cyrus adds: "And we have Silence as a backup. If combat does break out, I can 
cast Silence on the room to prevent alarm from spreading. It's not perfect, but 
it contains the situation."
 
CAPTAIN ANDRA'S PROFESSIONAL OPINION
The naval officer speaks plainly: "Commander, you're overthinking this. 
Infiltration operations succeed when you keep them simple and rely on proven 
skills. Chasing exotic alchemical solutions you're not trained with, deploying 
them with magic you're not practiced at combining, in a confined space with 
unknown variables-that's how operations fail."
She gestures to Kessa. "You have an expert infiltrator with magical restraint 
tools and proven skills. You have powerful magic users for support. You have a 
solid entry point and escape plan. Trust your team's capabilities rather than 
seeking a perfect solution that might not exist or might introduce more 
variables."
Korvan nods agreement. "Sailors have a saying: 'The best plan is the one that 
survives first contact.' Complicated plans with lots of moving parts break when 
something unexpected happens. Simple, flexible plans adapt."
 
KESSA'S FINAL ASSESSMENT
The rogue finishes attuning to the Rope of Entanglement-you see it respond 
to her will, coiling and uncoiling smoothly. She tests its weight, its response 
time. Satisfied, she looks up.
"Here's what I'm confident I can do: Enter through the privy silently. Scout the 
situation. If it's one or two guards, I can handle them with the Rope and my 
blades-quietly, efficiently. If it's Lucien asleep, I can restrain him before he 
wakes. If it's multiple alert guards or Lucien awake and aware... I retreat back 
through the privy, signal you, and we abort or adapt."
She pauses. "What I'm NOT confident I can do is deploy experimental alchemy 
I've never trained with, in a confined space, hoping it works perfectly on 
unknown targets before anyone raises an alarm. That's too many variables."
 
DECISION TIME
You're about an hour from Flotsam now. The sun is setting, painting the 
horizon orange and red.
Your realistic options:
Option A: Proceed with current plan (RECOMMENDED)
*	Kessa: Rope of Entanglement (attuned), infiltration via privy chute
*	Scout situation, restrain guards/targets silently if possible
*	Open stern windows for Johannes/Cyrus if needed
*	Adapt based on what she finds
*	Trust your team's proven skills
Option B: Seek sleep agent in Flotsam
*	Delay operation 6-12 hours minimum
*	Contact black market alchemist
*	Purchase Essence of Ether (if available, expensive)
*	Adds complexity and unknown variables
*	Might not even be available
Option C: Modified approach with Mage Hand
*	Johannes enters via stern windows with Kessa simultaneously
*	Immediately deploy gas via Mage Hand
*	Higher risk of detection during window entry
*	Relies on gas working as hoped
Option D: Observation and patience
*	Don't infiltrate tonight
*	Spend 1-2 days watching the flagship
*	Learn patterns, wait for optimal moment
*	Safest but costs time
 
Captain Andra is waiting for your final decision. "Commander? What 
are your orders? We'll be in position off Flotsam within the hour."
What do you want to do?
We have used it before. The gas takes seconds to affect its targets.
Dec 9
CORRECTED - ESSENCE OF ETHER 
KNOWLEDGE
You're right-looking back through the campaign, you have used Essence of 
Ether before. During previous operations, you deployed it successfully. It 
works within seconds (roughly 6-12 seconds, or 1-2 rounds in combat time) 
and affects creatures in a 15-foot radius who fail a CON save.
Essence of Ether properties (from your experience):
*	Area of effect: 15-foot radius when released
*	Onset: 6-12 seconds (fast-acting)
*	Effect: Unconsciousness for 1 minute (or until damaged/shaken awake)
*	CON save to resist (DC varies by concentration, usually 13-15)
*	Deployed by breaking a vial/container
*	User needs to avoid the area or hold breath
This changes the tactical picture significantly.
With Mage Hand, you can:
1.	Position the hand in the center of the captain's quarters
2.	Have it break/release the Essence of Ether vial
3.	Gas disperses rapidly in 15-foot radius
4.	Anyone in the room is unconscious within seconds
5.	Kessa (in the sealed privy) is unaffected
This is actually a very clean solution-if you can acquire the Essence of 
Ether in Flotsam.
 
REVISED PLAN WITH ESSENCE OF ETHER
Kessa reconsiders now that you've clarified the gas's effectiveness: "Okay, if we 
can get Essence of Ether and Johannes can deploy it remotely with Mage 
Hand, that's actually brilliant. I enter via the privy, stay sealed inside. 
Johannes uses Mage Hand through the door gap or keyhole to position the 
vial, breaks it, gas floods the room. Everyone drops within seconds. I wait ten 
seconds, open the door, the room is full of unconscious targets-including 
Elara, but that's fine. We secure everyone, wake Elara, extract."
Cyrus nods. "And if Highlord Lucien is in the room, he's unconscious too-
unable to raise alarm or resist. That's vastly safer than trying to restrain him 
while he's awake."
"Exactly," you confirm. "The question is: can we acquire Essence of 
Ether in Flotsam tonight?"
 
ACQUIRING ESSENCE OF ETHER IN FLOTSAM
Captain Andra considers. "Flotsam is a major port-black market trade is 
active there. Essence of Ether is expensive but not impossible to find. Your 
contact, 'The Fishwife,' would know who deals in alchemical goods."
She estimates: "Cost would be 300-500 gold pieces for a reliable vial, maybe 
more if the seller knows you're desperate. Time to acquire: 2-4 hours once you 
make contact with the right people-assuming they have it in stock."
Your current funds:
*	Johannes: ~3,600 gp personal
*	Party pooled: ~400 gp
*	Plus the Black Diamond (2,000 gp value, not yet sold)
You can easily afford it.
 
REVISED OPERATIONAL TIMELINE
Phase 1: Make Contact (Tonight, after dark)
*	Arrive off Flotsam (~1 hour from now)
*	Small boat to shore
*	Contact "The Fishwife" at her tavern
*	Gather intelligence: Elara's location, Lucien's status, guard strength
*	Request: Token for Elara's trust + connection to alchemical supplier
Phase 2: Acquire Essence of Ether (Tonight, 2-4 hours)
*	Meet with black market alchemist
*	Purchase Essence of Ether (300-500 gp)
*	Return to staging area
Phase 3: Infiltration (Late night/pre-dawn)
*	Underwater approach to Tiamat's Wrath
*	Kessa: Enter via discharge chute, position in privy
*	Kessa: Open stern window, let Johannes and Cyrus in (or Johannes 
stays outside to deploy Mage Hand)
*	Johannes: Use Mage Hand to deploy Essence of Ether in quarters
*	Wait 10-15 seconds for gas to take full effect
*	Enter room, secure unconscious targets
*	Wake Elara with token/identification
*	Extract via stern windows and waiting boat
Phase 4: Escape
*	Pre-positioned boat at stern
*	Dimension Door scroll as emergency backup
*	Extraction to Stormbreaker, depart before dawn
 
MAGE HAND DEPLOYMENT TACTICS
You clarify the exact approach: "I don't need to be inside the room 
initially. Mage Hand has 30-foot range. I can use it from outside the stern 
windows-have it phase through small gaps, position the vial in the center of 
the quarters, break it, and the gas does its work."
Cyrus confirms: "Mage Hand can manipulate objects up to 10 pounds. An 
Essence of Ether vial weighs maybe a few ounces. You can absolutely position 
and break it remotely."
Kessa grins. "So the sequence is: I enter through the privy and confirm the 
quarters are occupied. I signal you through the door or window. You use Mage 
Hand to deploy the gas. Ten seconds later, everyone's unconscious. I open the 
door, we secure the room, wake Elara, and we're gone before anyone knows 
what happened."
"Perfect," you confirm.
 
FINAL PLAN CONFIRMATION
Captain Andra looks satisfied. "That's a solid plan, Commander. Simple 
enough to execute, flexible enough to adapt, relies on proven tools and tactics. 
And acquiring the Essence of Ether gives you a decisive advantage without 
adding undue complexity."
Korvan adds: "And if the alchemist doesn't have it, or you can't acquire it for 
some reason, you fall back to the Rope of Entanglement and direct action. 
You're not dependent on the gas-it just makes things cleaner."
Cyrus performs a final blessing: "Mishakal grant us wisdom and Zeboim 
grant us storm-luck. May we free the innocent and avoid unnecessary 
bloodshed."
Kessa checks her gear one more time: Rope of Entanglement (coiled at 
her belt), daggers, lock picks, the works. "Ready when you are."
 
ARRIVAL AT FLOTSAM
The sun has set. Twilight darkens to full night as 
the Stormbreaker approaches Flotsam's waters. Captain Andra orders the 
ship to anchor well offshore-out of casual sight from the harbor, but close 
enough for small boat operations.
You can see the lights of Flotsam in the distance-a sprawling port city, 
currently under Dragon Army occupation but still functioning as a trade hub. 
The harbor is lit with torches and lanterns. You can make out the dark shapes 
of ships at anchor, including the massive silhouette of Tiamat's Wrath among 
them.
Captain Andra provides a small rowboat. "Two crew members will row 
you to the docks-quietly, no colors, no identification. They'll wait at a 
prearranged location for your signal. Red flare if you need emergency 
extraction, green when the mission is complete."
You, Kessa, and Cyrus board the small boat. The crew begins rowing toward 
the distant lights of Flotsam.
The operation has begun.
 
PHASE 1: CONTACT "THE FISHWIFE"
The rowboat approaches a quiet section of the docks-away from the main 
harbor where Dragon Army patrols are concentrated. The crew beaches the 
boat in shadow, and you step onto the wooden planks of Flotsam's waterfront.
The city at night:
*	Busy but not chaotic-sailors, merchants, dock workers going about 
their business
*	Dragon Army presence visible: occasional patrols of 3-4 soldiers, mostly 
focused on main thoroughfares
*	The tavern district is active-light, noise, crowds
*	Easy enough to blend in if you're careful
"The Fishwife" tavern is in the dock district-a rough establishment 
catering to sailors and smugglers. Your Haven briefing indicated the owner, a 
woman named Maris, is your contact.
You make your way through the streets, keeping to shadows, avoiding patrols. 
Within fifteen minutes, you're standing outside The Fishwife-a weathered 
two-story building with a faded sign showing a woman gutting fish.
 
What's your approach for making contact?
1.	Enter openly - Three travelers seeking food and drink, blend with the 
crowd
2.	Kessa scouts first - She enters alone, assesses the situation, signals if 
clear
3.	Use a recognition phrase - Haven would have provided a code 
word/phrase for identification
4.	Wait and observe - Watch the tavern for a few minutes, ensure no 
Dragon Army presence
And do you all enter together, or does someone stay outside as 
lookout?
1.	We don't assume anyone is uncompromised. Kessa should use a 
disguise in case our appearances have been uncovered and reported.
Dec 9
DISGUISE AND CAUTION
Smart thinking. You've already made waves with the Dragon Army-Pax 
Tharkas, the aboleth operation that involved naval cooperation, various 
resistance activities. It's entirely possible your descriptions have been 
circulated.
Kessa nods approvingly. "Good call. Let me change things up."
She ducks into a shadowed alley and begins her transformation. As a rogue 
with expertise in Deception and access to disguise tools, she's skilled at this:
Kessa's disguise:
*	Pulls her hair back into a tight bun, covers it with a worn scarf
*	Smudges dirt on her face, changes her posture (more slouched, less 
confident)
*	Removes her distinctive bracers, hides them under her cloak
*	Adds a slight limp to her gait
*	Transforms from "dangerous rogue" to "exhausted dock worker"
After a few minutes, she looks completely different-just another tired sailor 
ending a long shift.
Johannes and Cyrus are less distinctive in general, but you take basic 
precautions:
*	You pull your cloak's hood up, keep your face shadowed
*	Cyrus removes his holy symbol of Mishakal (too identifying), tucks it 
inside his robes
*	You both adopt the bearing of traveling merchants or sailors-
unremarkable, forgettable
 
ENTERING THE FISHWIFE
The three of you approach the tavern separately-Kessa first, then Cyrus a 
minute later, then you. Not obviously together, just three travelers seeking 
food and drink.
Inside The Fishwife:
The tavern is exactly what you'd expect from a dock district establishment:
*	Low ceiling, dark wood, smell of fish and stale ale
*	Maybe thirty patrons scattered across rough tables
*	Mix of sailors, dock workers, a few merchants
*	Two Dragon Army soldiers at a corner table (off-duty, drinking, not 
actively watching)
*	Bar along the back wall, tended by a weathered woman in her fifties
That must be Maris-"The Fishwife."
She's exactly what her nickname suggests: hard-faced, efficient, no-nonsense. 
She moves between customers with practiced ease, filling mugs, wiping tables, 
collecting coins. Her eyes are sharp though-you catch her scanning the room 
regularly, noting who enters, who leaves.
The atmosphere:
*	Not hostile, but wary-this is an occupied city
*	People keep to themselves, conversations quiet
*	The Dragon Army soldiers are mostly ignored (locals know better than 
to draw attention)
*	No overt resistance activity visible (smart-this is a public space)
 
MAKING CONTACT
Kessa, in her disguise, approaches the bar first. She orders ale in a rough 
sailor's voice, pays with a few copper coins. Maris serves her without 
comment, but you notice the tavern keeper's eyes linger on Kessa for just a 
moment-assessing.
Cyrus sits at a table near the wall, orders fish stew. Unremarkable.
You enter last, take a seat at the bar two stools away from Kessa. You order ale 
and fish, keeping your hood up, face shadowed.
Recognition phrase (from your Haven briefing): When ordering, you're 
supposed to say, "The catch was good up north. Hope it's the same down 
here."
You speak quietly to Maris when she brings your ale: "The catch was good 
up north. Hope it's the same down here."
Maris doesn't react overtly-she just wipes the bar, nods slightly, and says in a 
flat voice: "Depends on what you're fishing for. Some things are harder to 
catch these days."
Countersign confirmed. She's acknowledged you.
She leans in slightly, her voice dropping to barely audible: "Finish your drink. 
Upstairs, second door on the left. Five minutes." Then she moves on to 
another customer, her demeanor unchanged.
 
THE MEETING
Five minutes later, you make your way upstairs-quietly, separately. Kessa 
goes first, Cyrus second, you last. The staircase is at the back of the tavern, 
poorly lit.
Upstairs is a narrow hallway with several doors-private rooms, probably for 
lodgers or private meetings. The second door on the left is slightly ajar.
You slip inside. Kessa and Cyrus are already there. The room is small-a bed, a 
table, two chairs. Maris enters a moment later, closing the door firmly behind 
her.
She doesn't waste time with pleasantries.
"You're the Haven operators," she says flatly. Not a question. "I was 
told to expect three-a warlock, a cleric, and a rogue. The 
descriptions match well enough, even with your friend's disguise."
She looks at each of you in turn, assessing. "You're here about Lady 
Sharane's daughter, Elara. I assume you want intelligence on her 
location, the Dragon Army fleet, and probably access to resources 
you can't get through normal channels."
Maris sits on the edge of the table, arms crossed. "So let's be efficient. 
What do you need, and what's your timeline?"
 
INTELLIGENCE GATHERING
What do you ask Maris about?
Priority questions:
1.	Elara's exact location (captain's quarters vs. brig vs. officer cabin?)
2.	Token/phrase for Elara's trust (something from her mother?)
3.	Is Highlord Lucien currently aboard Tiamat's Wrath?
4.	Guard strength on the flagship, especially at night
5.	Alchemical supplier (Essence of Ether source?)
Secondary questions: 6. Harbor security and patrol patterns? 7. Dragon 
Army fleet disposition and timeline? 8. Any intelligence on Lucien's 
capabilities/weaknesses? 9. Safe house or staging area in the city? 10. 
Anything else?
Maris is waiting, clearly experienced with this kind of conversation. She'll 
answer what she can, but she's also assessing whether you're competent 
enough to pull off whatever you're planning.
How do you approach the conversation? What do you ask first?
All of the above.
Dec 9
INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING
You lean forward, keeping your voice low. "We need everything you have. 
Elara's exact location, proof of identity she'll trust, Lucien's current status, 
guard strength, an alchemical supplier, and anything else that helps us extract 
her tonight."
Maris's eyebrows raise slightly. "Tonight? You don't waste time." She nods, a 
hint of approval in her expression. "Good. The longer Elara stays aboard that 
ship, the worse her situation becomes. Let me tell you what I know."
She pulls out a small notebook-coded entries, clearly intelligence records.
 
1. ELARA'S LOCATION
"Elara is being held in the officer's cabin adjacent to Highlord 
Lucien's quarters aboard Tiamat's Wrath," Maris states. "Not in the 
brig-Lucien wants her close. She's leverage against her mother, 
and he's been... let's say, 'encouraging' her to write letters 
convincing Lady Sharane to cooperate with Dragon Army supply 
contracts."
Her expression hardens. "He hasn't physically harmed her-yet. But the threat 
is always there. She's essentially under house arrest in that cabin. The door is 
locked from the outside, and there's typically one guard posted in the 
passageway outside."
Kessa asks: "Is she restrained inside the cabin?"
"Not physically bound, no. But she's locked in a small room with no windows, 
limited supplies. She's been there for two weeks-she'll be desperate to leave."
Key detail: Elara is in the adjacent officer cabin, not the main captain's 
quarters with Lucien. This is actually better for your plan-you can potentially 
extract her without directly confronting Lucien.
 
2. TOKEN FOR ELARA'S TRUST
Maris reaches into her pocket and produces a small object: a silver locket 
on a delicate chain.
"This belonged to Elara's grandmother-passed down through 
Sharane's family. Elara wore it constantly until the Dragon Army 
confiscated her personal effects when they took her. Lady Sharane 
gave this to me specifically for identification purposes."
She hands it to you. The locket is engraved with a sailing ship and waves-
Sharane's merchant house symbol. Inside is a tiny painted portrait of a young 
woman (presumably Elara's grandmother).
"Show her this. Tell her 'Your mother remembers the storms you 
weathered together.' That's the phrase Sharane specified. Elara 
will know it's genuine-it references a specific incident from her 
childhood that only family would know."
You pocket the locket carefully. Authentication secured.
 
3. HIGHLORD LUCIEN'S STATUS
"Lucien is currently aboard Tiamat's Wrath," Maris confirms, and you 
see Cyrus's expression tighten slightly. "He rarely leaves the flagship-
he's coordinating the fleet deployment from there. However, his 
schedule is somewhat predictable."
She consults her notes:
"Most nights, Lucien retires to his quarters around midnight. He 
works late-reading reports, planning operations. Around 10 PM to 
midnight, he's usually in the captain's quarters actively working. 
After midnight, he sleeps until dawn."
"So if we infiltrate after midnight, he'll be asleep?" you ask.
"Most likely, yes. But understand-Lucien is a high-level combatant. Former 
mercenary captain before joining the Dragon Army. He's dangerous even 
when surprised. If you wake him, you'll have a fight on your hands."
She pauses. "That said, the officer's cabin where Elara is held has its own 
door-it doesn't require you to go through Lucien's quarters. If you're quiet, 
you might extract her without ever entering his room."
 
4. GUARD STRENGTH
Maris provides detailed numbers:
On Tiamat's Wrath at night:
*	Main deck: 12-15 guards on active watch (rotating shifts)
*	Upper gun deck: Skeleton crew, most sleeping (~8-10 awake)
*	Lower deck: 2 guards at the brig, occasional roving patrol
*	Captain's quarters area: 1-2 guards in the passageway outside 
officer cabins
*	Total alert personnel: ~30-40 at any given time
*	Full crew available if alarm raised: 180-200 soldiers and sailors
"The guard outside Elara's cabin door is the most immediate 
threat," Maris notes. "He's stationed in the passageway between the 
captain's quarters and the officer's cabin. Armed, armored, alert 
enough. Dragon Army regular-not elite, but competent."
"Single guard?" Kessa confirms.
"Usually, yes. Sometimes two if Lucien is expecting trouble, but that's rare. 
He's arrogant enough to think one guard is sufficient."
 
5. ALCHEMICAL SUPPLIER
"You need Essence of Ether," you state directly. "Where can we get it?"
Maris doesn't ask why-professional enough not to question operational 
details. "There's an alchemist in the warehouse district named 
Tessik. He supplies the black market-poisons, antidotes, specialty 
compounds. If anyone in Flotsam has Essence of Ether, it's him."
She writes down an address on a scrap of parchment. "His workshop is in 
the old chandlery, third warehouse from the eastern pier. Knock 
three times, pause, knock twice. Tell him 'Maris sent you for the 
deep sleep.' He'll know what you need."
"Cost?" you ask.
"For a reliable vial? 400 gold pieces. Tessik doesn't negotiate much, but his 
product is quality-fast-acting, consistent concentration. You don't want to 
cheap out on this."
"How long to acquire it?"
"If you go now, you can be there and back within two hours. Tessik works 
late-alchemists keep odd hours."
 
6. HARBOR SECURITY
"Dragon Army patrols the harbor with small boats," Maris 
explains. "Usually two patrol boats active at night, circling the fleet. 
They're not particularly alert-mostly going through motions. But 
they will investigate anything unusual like unauthorized boats 
approaching the warships."
She sketches a rough map on parchment:
"Tiamat's Wrath is anchored here-" she marks the center of the 
harbor "-surrounded by the other fourteen warships in a defensive 
formation. Patrol boats circle the perimeter. Your best approach is 
from the seaward side, underwater if possible. The patrols focus on 
surface threats, not divers."
Cyrus confirms: "We have magical water breathing and underwater mobility. 
That's our plan."
Maris nods approvingly. "Smart. Just be aware-the water near the flagship is 
only about 40 feet deep. You won't have the depth advantage you might want, 
but it's workable."
 
7. FLEET DISPOSITION AND TIMELINE
"The Dragon Army fleet deploys in nine days," Maris states. "They're 
loading final supplies now-food, weapons, siege equipment. The 
target is the Ak-Thyln region-they're planning a coastal invasion 
to secure deepwater ports and cut off resistance supply lines."
Your stomach tightens. Ak-Thyln-where you just forged an alliance, where 
Admiral Kethren committed resources to your operation, where you were 
treated as honored guests.
"Once the fleet sails, they're nearly unstoppable," Maris 
continues. "Fifteen warships carrying 3,000 soldiers, siege weapons, 
and logistical support. The coastal cities won't have the naval 
power to resist."
She looks at you directly. "I don't know what Haven's plan is for 
stopping them, but I hope it's good. Because if that fleet reaches 
open water, a lot of people are going to die."
You exchange glances with Cyrus and Kessa. The Tempest Scepter aboard 
the Stormbreaker suddenly feels even heavier in responsibility.
 
8. LUCIEN'S CAPABILITIES
"Highlord Lucien is a 12th-level Fighter," Maris says grimly. "Former 
mercenary captain, veteran of a dozen campaigns. He's skilled with 
greatsword and tactical combat. He also has two magical items I 
know of: a Cloak of Displacement that makes him harder to hit, and 
a Ring of Protection. He's tough, experienced, and ruthless."
"Weaknesses?" Kessa asks.
"Arrogance. He underestimates opponents he considers beneath him-
resistance fighters, infiltrators, anyone not Dragon Army. He also relies 
heavily on his guards and doesn't expect direct threats aboard his own 
flagship. If you surprise him while he's asleep, you might have a chance. But in 
a fair fight..." She shakes her head. "Don't fight fair."
 
9. SAFE HOUSE
"I have a room here you can use for staging," Maris offers. "This 
room, actually. It's secure, private, and I control access. You can 
prepare here, store equipment, rest if needed. When you're ready 
to move, I can provide a small boat for your approach-
unregistered, unmarked, less conspicuous than rowing from your 
ship."
"Appreciated," you confirm.
 
10. ADDITIONAL INTELLIGENCE
Maris adds a few more critical details:
"The stern of Tiamat's Wrath faces northwest-away from the 
main harbor traffic. That's your best approach vector. The ship's 
name is painted on the stern in gold letters, impossible to miss."
"Shift change for guards happens at midnight and again at 4 AM. 
Between midnight and 1 AM, there's slight confusion as guards 
rotate-best window for infiltration."
"If alarm is raised, the entire harbor will respond. Dragon Army 
has protocols-signal fires, bell towers. You'll have maybe five 
minutes before reinforcements arrive from shore. Your escape 
needs to be fast."
"Elara is in poor condition-malnourished, stressed, possibly 
traumatized. She may not be able to move quickly. Plan for that."
 
OPERATIONAL TIMELINE
Maris looks at you expectantly. "So, here's what I'm hearing: You need 
to acquire Essence of Ether from Tessik, then infiltrate Tiamat's 
Wrath after midnight during the guard shift change. Extract Elara 
from the officer's cabin, avoid or neutralize the guard outside, and 
escape before alarm spreads. That about right?"
You nod. "That's the plan."
"Then I suggest you move quickly. It's currently about 9 PM. You 
need two hours to acquire the Essence of Ether, maybe an hour to 
prepare and position yourselves, which puts your infiltration 
window at midnight to 1 AM-perfect timing."
She stands. "I'll have a small boat ready at the eastern pier by 
11:30 PM. Retrieve your alchemy, come back here to gear up, then 
make your approach. Questions?"
 
CURRENT STATUS:
*	Time: ~9:00 PM
*	Funds available: 3,600+ gp (more than enough for Essence of Ether)
*	Token acquired: Silver locket + passphrase
*	Alchemist location: Known (Tessik, old chandlery)
*	Intelligence: Complete and detailed
*	Infiltration window: Midnight to 1 AM (optimal)
*	Staging area: Secured (this room)
What do you do?
1.	Go immediately to acquire Essence of Ether (allows maximum 
prep time)
2.	Ask Maris follow-up questions (anything unclear?)
3.	Discuss the plan with Kessa and Cyrus (finalize approach)
4.	Something else?
The clock is ticking. You have about three hours until optimal infiltration 
window.
Get the Ether, and we're changing the plan slightly. Since the lavatory is still in 
Lucien's room, we begin by incapacitating him with the gas, then securing him 
with the Rope until Kessa can replace it with regular rope. Then Cyrus and I 
join her in the Captain's quarters. From there, we subdue the guard (non-lethal 
if possible), then get Elara and return to Lucien's room. From there, we render 
him unconscious (a good blow to the head or maybe a regular sleeping 
draught), then all of us leave through the rear window, and out under cover of 
darkness through the water. If we can, cast Water Breathing on all who need it, 
so we can go under the water to avoid detection, then back here with the 
Highlord and Elara, neat as you please. Another ransom for the Dragon Army, 
this time, that all the soldiers in the fleet have to disembark or the Highlord 
dies. Once they are clear, we use the Scepter to ground them in Flotsam with 
no gear, no equipment, and we hightail it back to Haven, leaving the army 
grounded? Thoughts, opinions?

Dec 9
AMBITIOUS PLAN - TEAM ASSESSMENT
You lay out the expanded operation, and there's a long moment of silence as 
everyone processes it.
Maris speaks first, her tone carefully neutral: "You want to kidnap a 
Dragon Army Highlord from his flagship in an occupied harbor, 
ransom him to force the entire fleet to disembark, then use... 
something... to destroy the grounded ships?"
"The Tempest Scepter," Cyrus says quietly. "We recovered it from 
Zeboim's temple. It can summon storms powerful enough to wreck 
ships."
Maris's eyes widen slightly-the first crack in her professional 
demeanor. "You have the Scepter. That's... that changes things 
considerably." She sits back down, thinking hard.
Kessa is already working through logistics: "Kidnapping Lucien is doable 
if the gas works. Securing him, extracting him through the 
window-all manageable. But he's a 12th-level Fighter in magical 
armor. Even unconscious, he's heavy. Getting him through the 
water back to shore..."
Cyrus raises a critical concern: "And the ransom demand itself-will the 
Dragon Army comply? They're fanatics. They might simply refuse, 
sacrifice Lucien, and proceed with their mission anyway. We'd be 
holding a hostage they don't care about."
 
BREAKING DOWN THE CHALLENGES
Let's analyze each component:
1. CAPTURING LUCIEN
Feasibility: HIGH
*	Gas him in his quarters (achievable with Essence of Ether + Mage 
Hand)
*	Secure with Rope of Entanglement (DC 15 DEX save while unconscious 
= automatic failure)
*	Replace with regular rope while maintaining unconsciousness
Challenges:
*	He has a Cloak of Displacement and Ring of Protection (high saves, hard 
to affect with magic)
*	CON save against Essence of Ether might be strong (he's a high-level 
Fighter)
*	If he wakes during extraction, he's extremely dangerous even restrained
Maris adds: "If you're going to keep him unconscious for an extended 
period, you'll need more than a blow to the head. That's unreliable and 
dangerous. You'd need a proper sedative-Tessik can provide sleeping 
draughts that last 4-8 hours. That's an additional 100 gold."
 
2. EXTRACTING LUCIEN + ELARA
Feasibility: MEDIUM-LOW
Weight problem:
*	Lucien in full armor: ~220-250 lbs
*	Elara (malnourished but adult woman): ~120-140 lbs
*	Total: 340-390 lbs of unconscious/semi-conscious bodies
Underwater extraction: Cyrus can cast Water Breathing on the party 
(you, Kessa, Cyrus, Elara, Lucien = 5 people, within the spell's capacity). But 
swimming with unconscious people underwater is extremely difficult:
*	You'd need to tow them both
*	Underwater movement speed is halved unless you have swim speed
*	Distance from Tiamat's Wrath to shore: ~800 feet
*	Time underwater: 10-15 minutes of sustained swimming while towing
*	Risk of discovery: Moderate to high
Kessa points out: "My swimming isn't great. I can manage myself 
underwater, but I can't tow a 250-pound armored man. You have 
the Cloak of Manta Ray-60-foot swim speed. Cyrus has the 
Amulet-swim speed. But I'd be slow, vulnerable, and useless for 
hauling bodies."
Boat extraction alternative: Maris suggests: "If you're taking Lucien, 
you need a boat positioned at the stern. Load unconscious bodies 
into the boat, row to shore under cover of darkness. Faster, more 
practical than underwater towing."
But this creates a new problem: A boat with 5 people (3 rowing, 2 
unconscious) is visible, slow, and vulnerable to patrol boats.
 
3. THE RANSOM DEMAND
Feasibility: LOW
This is where the plan faces its biggest challenge.
Cyrus voices the core problem: "The Dragon Army follows Takhisis-the 
Queen of Darkness. Their doctrine is absolute obedience to the cause. 
Individual lives, even high-ranking officers, are expendable if it serves the 
greater mission."
Maris nods grimly. "Lucien is valuable, yes. But the Dragon Highlords 
are fanatics. If you demand they disembark 3,000 soldiers and 
abandon their mission to save one officer... they might just refuse. 
Especially if they suspect you can't or won't kill him."
She continues: "And even if they comply initially, what stops them 
from simply re-embarking once Lucien is returned? Or from 
sending assassins to retrieve him by force? You'd need to hold him 
for days or weeks to truly disrupt the operation-which means 
secure location, guards, food, and dealing with his eventual escape 
attempts or Dragon Army rescue operations."
Kessa adds: "Plus, the moment we make the ransom demand, the entire 
fleet goes on high alert. They'll know someone has the Scepter-or at least has 
the capability to threaten them. That makes Phase 3 harder because they'll be 
watching for exactly that kind of attack."
 
4. USING THE SCEPTER AGAINST GROUNDED SHIPS
Feasibility: HIGH (if you can force disembarkment)
If you somehow get the soldiers off the ships, using the Tempest Scepter to 
destroy grounded vessels is absolutely viable:
*	Control Weather (8th-level spell) + Storm's Fury can create devastating 
conditions
*	Grounded ships with no crews are helpless against magical storms
*	15 warships destroyed = massive Dragon Army setback
But the "if" is enormous. Getting 3,000 soldiers to voluntarily disembark 
their combat-ready warships because you're holding their commander hostage 
is... optimistic.
 
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES
Maris, Cyrus, and Kessa discuss alternatives:
OPTION A: EXTRACT ELARA ONLY (ORIGINAL PLAN)
Pros:
*	Focused, achievable objective
*	Lower risk, faster execution
*	Maintains surprise for Phase 3 (Scepter attack on fleet)
*	Lucien remains unaware you have the Scepter
Cons:
*	Doesn't directly disrupt Dragon Army fleet operations
*	Lucien remains in command
*	You still need to face the full fleet in Phase 3
OPTION B: CAPTURE LUCIEN, ASSASSINATE HIM
Pros:
*	Removes fleet commander, causes command disruption
*	Easier than extracting him alive (kill and leave)
*	Delays fleet deployment while they sort out succession
*	Still maintains surprise about the Scepter
Cons:
*	Kills someone who might be coerced or redeemed later
*	Dragon Army has other officers who can take command
*	Doesn't prevent fleet from eventually sailing
OPTION C: CAPTURE LUCIEN, HIDE HIM LONG-TERM
Pros:
*	Fleet loses commander, can't deploy without proper leadership
*	Buys significant time (days or weeks)
*	Lucien becomes intelligence asset if interrogated
*	Could eventually ransom him for major concessions
Cons:
*	Requires secure hidden location in occupied city
*	Days/weeks of guard duty and feeding prisoner
*	High risk of Dragon Army finding him
*	Complicated logistics
OPTION D: YOUR RANSOM PLAN
Pros:
*	If successful, achieves total victory without direct combat
*	Saves lives on both sides
*	Destroys fleet with minimal casualties
Cons:
*	Extremely low probability Dragon Army complies
*	High risk of them calling your bluff
*	Requires holding dangerous prisoner during negotiation
*	Tips them off about Scepter, making Phase 3 much harder
OPTION E: EXTRACT ELARA, THEN SCEPTER ATTACK WHILE 
FLEET MANNED
Pros:
*	Two separate operations, lower complexity each
*	Surprise attack with Scepter is maximally effective
*	No extended prisoner situation to manage
Cons:
*	High casualties among Dragon Army sailors (3,000+ at sea)
*	Morally difficult given your stated values about sparing lives
*	Risk of ships escaping or fighting back
 
CYRUS'S MORAL PERSPECTIVE
The cleric speaks carefully: "Johannes, I appreciate that you're trying 
to minimize casualties. The ransom plan aligns with our values-
giving the Dragon Army soldiers a chance to live, to choose 
differently. But we must be realistic about its chances of success."
He looks troubled. "If we capture Lucien and they refuse our 
demands, we're left with a difficult choice: kill him to prove we're 
serious, or release him and admit defeat. The first violates our 
principles. The second makes us look weak and accomplishes 
nothing."
"Moreover, if they refuse and we kill him anyway, we've simply 
murdered a prisoner-which is worse than killing him in combat. 
And if we release him, we've shown the Dragon Army they can defy 
us without consequences."
He pauses. "I'm not saying the plan is wrong. I'm saying it requires 
the Dragon Army to value Lucien's life more than their mission. 
And everything we know about them suggests they don't."
 
KESSA'S TACTICAL PERSPECTIVE
"Here's my read," Kessa says bluntly. "The original plan is solid: Get 
in, gas Lucien's quarters, grab Elara, get out. Clean, fast, 
achievable. Adding 'also kidnap the Highlord' increases complexity 
by like 500%. We're talking about extracting a heavy, dangerous 
prisoner through hostile territory, then managing a hostage 
situation for days while hoping fanatics care about one officer's 
life."
She shrugs. "I'm not saying it's impossible. I'm saying it turns a high-
probability tactical operation into a low-probability strategic 
gambit. If you want to roll those dice, I'm with you. But let's be 
clear about what we're risking."
 
MARIS'S INTELLIGENCE ASSESSMENT
The resistance contact speaks carefully: "Commander, I've been running 
intelligence operations in occupied territory for three years. I've 
seen the Dragon Army up close. They're zealots. They worship 
Takhisis and believe their conquest is divinely mandated."
"Individual lives-even high-ranking officers-are sacrificed 
routinely if it serves the mission. I've personally witnessed them 
abandon wounded officers to capture rather than risk a tactical 
objective. Lucien is valuable, but he's not irreplaceable."
She leans forward. "That said, if you're determined to try the ransom, 
I can help facilitate it. I have channels to contact the Dragon Army 
command structure. But my professional assessment? They'll 
refuse, then come for him in force. You'll have bought maybe 12-24 
hours before they mount a major rescue operation."
 
YOUR DECISION
The room is quiet, waiting for your call.
The core question: Do you stick with the focused, high-probability plan 
(extract Elara only), or do you attempt the ambitious, low-probability plan 
(capture Lucien + ransom)?
Factors to consider:
*	Your stated values (spare lives where possible)
*	Tactical complexity and risk
*	Probability of Dragon Army compliance
*	Impact on Phase 3 (Scepter attack)
*	Time and resources required
*	Moral implications of prisoner-taking
What do you decide?
1.	Proceed with original plan - Extract Elara only, leave Lucien alone
2.	Modified ambitious plan - Capture Lucien, hold him long-term, 
disrupt fleet operations
3.	Full ransom plan - Capture Lucien, demand disembarkment, attack 
grounded ships
4.	Assassination plan - Gas Lucien, kill him, extract Elara, eliminate 
fleet command
5.	Something else?
Kessa, Cyrus, and Maris are ready to support whatever you decide-but they 
want to be clear-eyed about the probabilities and risks.
What's your call?
Assassination it is, then. I'd like the chance to save soldiers, but like you said, 
the fanatics would prevent any desertions. So, as soon as we get Elara to 
safety, with Zeboim's blessing, we use the Scepter to decimate the fleet, 
leaving the survivors to the mercy of the Flotsam populace, while we make our 
retreat to Haven.
Dec 9
THE DECISION - ASSASSINATION AND STORM
You take a breath, weighing everything. The idealism of saving lives against 
the cold reality of fanatics who won't accept mercy.
"Assassination, then," you say firmly. "We extract Elara and 
eliminate Lucien in the process. Once Elara is safe aboard 
the Stormbreaker, we use the Tempest Scepter to destroy the 
Dragon Army fleet in harbor-crews and all. Fast, decisive, 
complete."
Cyrus closes his eyes briefly, his expression pained but resolute. "May 
Mishakal forgive us. And may those sailors find peace in whatever 
afterlife awaits them." He opens his eyes. "But yes-you're right. If 
they won't choose freedom, and we can't offer them mercy they'll 
accept, then we end the threat completely. Hundreds die so that 
thousands along the coast might live."
Kessa nods, her professionalism overriding any moral hesitation. "Clean kill 
on Lucien, then we're gone before anyone knows. The fleet dies 
later the same night, nobody connects the two operations. It 
works."
Maris looks at you with something like respect. "A hard choice, 
Commander. But the right one for the circumstances. Better a 
quick death in a storm than years of conquest and occupation. I'll 
make sure Lady Sharane knows her daughter was your priority-
Lucien's death was necessary but secondary."
 
REVISED OPERATIONAL PLAN
PHASE 1: INFILTRATION & ASSASSINATION (Tonight, Midnight-1 
AM)
Preparation:
*	Acquire Essence of Ether from Tessik (400 gp)
*	Acquire long-acting sedative for Elara if needed (100 gp, in case she 
panics)
*	Water Breathing cast on all three of you (8 hours duration)
Execution:
1.	Underwater approach to Tiamat's Wrath stern (midnight, during guard 
shift change)
2.	Kessa climbs stern hull, enters via discharge chute, positions in privy
3.	Johannes uses Mage Hand to deploy Essence of Ether in Lucien's 
quarters
4.	Wait 15-20 seconds for gas to take full effect (Lucien unconscious)
5.	Kessa exits privy, confirms Lucien is unconscious
6.	Kessa opens stern windows, admits Johannes and Cyrus
7.	Execute Lucien - Quick, certain, quiet (blade to throat, Inflict 
Wounds, etc.)
8.	Move to officer's cabin, neutralize guard (Rope of Entanglement, non-
lethal if possible)
9.	Enter cabin, authenticate to Elara with locket and passphrase
10.	Extract Elara through stern windows to waiting boat
11.	Row to shore, return to safe house
12.	Secure Elara, depart Flotsam aboard Stormbreaker
PHASE 2: FLEET DESTRUCTION (Same Night, 3-4 AM)
Preparation:
*	Elara secured and recovering aboard Stormbreaker
*	Ship positioned at optimal range (5-6 miles offshore, Scepter range)
*	Cyrus prepares to call the storm
Execution:
1.	Cyrus uses Tempest Scepter: Storm's Fury (1/day, 1-mile radius)
2.	Massive storm engulfs Flotsam harbor-devastating winds, lightning, 
torrential rain
3.	15 Dragon Army warships, anchored and crewed, subjected to 
hurricane-force winds
4.	Ships battered, capsized, shattered against docks and each other
5.	Crews drowned or forced to abandon ship in chaos
6.	Stormbreaker remains outside storm radius, safely observes
7.	When storm subsides (1 hour duration), fleet is destroyed
8.	Set sail immediately for Haven before Dragon Army can organize 
response
Estimated casualties: 2,500-3,000 Dragon Army personnel (sailors, 
marines, officers)
Justification: Prevent invasion of Ak-Thyln region, save tens of thousands of 
civilians from conquest
 
CYRUS'S BURDEN
The cleric looks at the Tempest Scepter, understanding the weight of what he's 
about to do.
"I will bear this," he says quietly. "The deaths of those sailors will be 
on my conscience, not yours, Johannes. You made the strategic 
decision. I will execute it. And I will pray for their souls-every one 
of them-even as I call the storm that kills them."
He looks up, his eyes hard with resolve beneath the sorrow. "Zeboim 
blessed us with this weapon to stop tyranny. Those sailors serve an 
army of conquest and slavery. They've made their choice-to sail 
against the free peoples of Ansalon. We make ours-to stop them."
"But I will remember them. Every life. And I will carry that weight 
as the goddess intended-with wisdom, with mercy where possible, 
and with grief for the necessity."
 
KESSA'S PROFESSIONAL ASSESSMENT
"Okay, so the kill on Lucien," Kessa says, moving to practical 
matters. "You want it clean and certain. Here are our options:"
Option 1: Blade work (Kessa)
*	Throat cut while unconscious
*	Silent, certain, professional
*	No magic signature, looks like assassination
Option 2: Spell (Johannes or Cyrus)
*	Inflict Wounds (Cyrus, touch attack, 5d10 necrotic damage-almost 
certainly fatal to unconscious target)
*	Eldritch Blast point-blank (Johannes, 2 beams at advantage while target 
unconscious)
*	Certain kill, but magical residue might be detected
Option 3: Combination
*	Kessa restrains with Rope while unconscious
*	Cyrus delivers Inflict Wounds (divine execution)
*	Symbolic-servant of Mishakal ending servant of Takhisis
"What's your preference?" Kessa asks. "I'm comfortable with all 
three, but Option 3 feels... more righteous, if that matters to you."
 
MARIS'S FINAL SUPPORT
"I'll have the boat ready at the eastern pier at 11:45 PM," Maris 
confirms. "Small, unmarked, oars muffled. I'll also have a covered 
cart standing by to transport Elara quickly through the streets if 
needed-she'll be weak, possibly unable to walk far."
"One more thing," she adds. "When the storm hits the harbor at 3 
AM, the entire city will wake. There will be chaos, panic, Dragon 
Army scrambling to respond. That's your window to leave. Sail out 
while everyone's distracted by the disaster. By the time they realize 
it was a magical attack, you'll be long gone."
She stands. "Go get your Essence of Ether. Be back here by 11:30 PM 
to gear up. I'll brief Elara's mother after you've extracted her-Lady 
Sharane will want to know her daughter is safe."
 
ACQUIRING ESSENCE OF ETHER
Current time: 9:15 PM
You leave The Fishwife through the back exit, moving through Flotsam's 
streets toward the warehouse district. The address Maris provided leads you to 
an old chandlery-weathered building, dim light visible through cracks in the 
shutters.
You knock: three times, pause, twice.
A slot opens in the door. Eyes peer out. "Yeah?"
"Maris sent us for the deep sleep," you say quietly.
The door opens. Tessik is a thin man, maybe sixty, with chemical burns on 
his hands and the sharp smell of reagents clinging to his clothes. His 
workshop is cramped-shelves lined with bottles, jars, vials, strange apparatus 
bubbling away.
"Deep sleep, huh? Essence of Ether. How many doses?"
"One vial," you confirm. "Reliable, fast-acting."
He nods, moving to a locked cabinet. "400 gold. This is fresh batch-
synthesized two days ago. Onset in 6-10 seconds, unconsciousness 
for 60-90 seconds minimum, longer if they don't fight it. CON save 
DC 15 to resist. 15-foot radius dispersal."
He produces a small glass vial-clear liquid inside, sealed with wax. "Break 
this in the center of the room. Hold your breath if you're in the area 
of effect. Questions?"
You pay him 400 gold. Essence of Ether acquired.
"Need anything else?" Tessik asks. "Sedatives, antidotes, poisons? I 
stock everything."
 
Do you purchase anything else?
*	Sedative for Elara (100 gp, ensures she stays calm/quiet during 
extraction)
*	Antidote to Essence of Ether (50 gp, in case you need to wake someone 
quickly)
*	Poison for backup killing method (100 gp, various types)
*	Other alchemical supplies?
Current funds: 3,200 gp remaining (after Essence of Ether purchase)
Current time: 9:45 PM (15 minutes to acquire, need to be back at The 
Fishwife by 11:30 PM)
What else do you need?
Option 1. When the ships go down, if Lucien isn't discovered, no one would be 
the wiser about how he died.
Antidote and Poison - execution is not violent, can be peaceful.
And since we are invoking Zeboim's magic, perhaps the invoked storm might 
not kill soldiers, but just founder and beach the ships on rocks and shoals, 
rendering them unusable and impressing on everyone the power of the sea 
and its mistress?
Dec 9
REVISED APPROACH - MERCY IN THE STORM
You consider the plan more carefully, and something shifts in your thinking.
"Option 1-Kessa's blade work," you decide. "Clean, professional, no 
magical signature. When the ships go down and the chaos settles, if 
Lucien's body is found, it'll just look like he died in the storm with 
everyone else. No investigation, no suspicion of infiltration."
Kessa nods. "Throat cut while unconscious. He won't feel it, won't 
wake. Professional courtesy."
You turn back to Tessik. "I'll also take an antidote to the Essence of 
Ether and... what poisons do you have? Something peaceful. Not 
violent."
Tessik raises an eyebrow but doesn't question. "Antidote, 50 gold-brings 
someone out of Ether-induced unconsciousness within 30 seconds. 
As for peaceful poisons..."
He retrieves several vials. "Dreamless Rest-ingested, painless, victim 
simply doesn't wake up. 100 gold. Or Shadow's Kiss-inhaled or 
ingested, induces euphoria then unconsciousness, death within 
minutes. Also 100 gold."
"Dreamless Rest," you choose. "Just in case."
Total purchase: 550 gold (Essence of Ether 400 + Antidote 50 + 
Dreamless Rest 100)
Remaining funds: 3,050 gp
 
THE STORM'S MERCY
As you're concluding the transaction, Cyrus speaks up, his voice thoughtful:
"Johannes, I've been thinking about the storm. About Zeboim's 
blessing and what she would approve of."
He holds up the Tempest Scepter. "We're invoking her power, yes-but 
remember what she values: freedom, strength, respect for the sea. 
She approved of us because we fight against slavery and mind 
control. She's not Takhisis-she doesn't delight in pointless 
slaughter."
You see where he's going. "You're thinking the storm doesn't have to 
kill everyone."
"Exactly," Cyrus says with growing conviction. "Storm's Fury summons 
devastating winds, lightning, torrential rain. But we can direct it-
use it to destroy the ships without necessarily drowning every 
sailor aboard. Drive the ships onto rocks, beach them on shoals, 
shatter them against the docks. Give the crews a chance to abandon 
ship, to swim to shore, to survive."
Kessa considers this. "So we're not trying to massacre 3,000 people. 
We're trying to wreck 15 warships and leave the Dragon Army with 
survivors who have no ships, no equipment, stranded in Flotsam."
"Yes," Cyrus confirms. "The invasion is stopped-completely. The 
fleet is destroyed. But the soldiers have the choice to survive, to 
swim, to reach shore. Many will still die-storms are deadly, 
drowning is a real risk-but we're not deliberately targeting human 
lives. We're targeting the ships themselves."
He looks at you earnestly. "This is Zeboim's way. The sea is dangerous, 
storms are deadly, but they're not malicious. They test strength 
and courage. The strong survive. The weak perish. But there's still 
choice, still a chance. That's different from simply murdering 
3,000 men in their sleep."
 
TACTICAL IMPLICATIONS
Kessa works through the logistics: "Okay, so the storm hits at 3 AM-
most crews are sleeping below deck or on light watch. Sudden 
hurricane-force winds, ships start breaking apart or being driven 
onto rocks. Sailors wake up, realize they're in mortal danger, have 
to choose: stay aboard a sinking ship or jump into stormy waters 
and try to reach shore."
"How far offshore are the ships?" you ask.
Maris had said the fleet is anchored in the harbor-maybe 400-800 feet from 
shore depending on the vessel's position. Close enough that strong 
swimmers could make it, especially if wreckage provides flotation.
Cyrus adds: "And the harbor itself provides some protection-it's not 
open ocean. The storm will be devastating to the ships, but the 
waters aren't as deadly as they would be at sea. Sailors who 
abandon ship quickly have a real chance of survival."
"So we're looking at what-maybe 30-50% casualties instead of 
90%?" Kessa estimates. "Still hundreds dead, but also hundreds or 
thousands who live."
"Yes," Cyrus says soberly. "Still a tragedy. Still blood on our hands. 
But it respects Zeboim's principles-we're using her power to 
destroy the instruments of tyranny (the ships), while still honoring 
the sanctity of choice and the possibility of survival."
 
ZEBOIM'S APPROVAL
You think back to the temple, to the offering you made, to the spirit's 
words: "Do not waver when the storm tests you."
This feels right. Zeboim values strength and freedom. She would approve of 
destroying the ships-the tools of conquest-while still allowing the soldiers 
the freedom to fight for their own survival. Those who are strong, clever, or 
lucky will live. Those who aren't will perish.
It's the way of the sea: beautiful, terrible, and fair in its unfairness.
"This is the plan," you decide. "We wreck the fleet, not massacre the 
crews. Cyrus, when you call the storm, focus the Scepter's power 
on the ships themselves-drive them onto rocks, smash them 
against docks, break their masts and hulls. Let the waters be 
treacherous but not impossible. The soldiers get the same chance 
anyone gets in a storm: survive if you can."
Cyrus nods, relief evident in his expression. "Thank you, Johannes. This 
sits better with my conscience. I'll still be calling a storm that kills 
hundreds-I understand that, and I accept the burden. But at least 
they'll have a chance. At least we're not simply butchering them."
Kessa shrugs. "Works for me. Dead fleet is a dead fleet, whether the 
sailors drown or make it to shore. Either way, the invasion's 
stopped and the Dragon Army has 1,500-2,000 wet, cold, 
equipment-less soldiers stranded in a hostile city with no way to 
continue their mission."

RETURN TO THE FISHWIFE
You leave Tessik's workshop with your alchemical supplies and head back to 
The Fishwife. The streets are quieter now-nearly 10 PM, most honest folk are 
inside.
Current time: 10:15 PM
You arrive back at the tavern, slip upstairs to the private room. Maris is 
waiting.
"You got what you needed?" she asks.
You show her the vials. "Essence of Ether, antidote, backup options. 
We're ready."
"Good. You have about 90 minutes before the boat is ready. I 
suggest you rest, meditate, prepare mentally. This is going to be a 
long night."
She pauses, then adds: "For what it's worth, Commander-what you're 
doing tonight will save thousands of lives. The coastal cities, Ak-
Thyln, all the people who would have suffered under Dragon Army 
occupation. Elara's mother will have her daughter back. And the 
Dragon Army will learn that their conquest isn't inevitable."
She offers her hand. "May the gods favor your mission."
 
FINAL PREPARATIONS (10:15 PM - 11:45 PM)
You have 90 minutes before departure. How do you spend it?
Options:
*	Short rest (recover any spent resources, though you're mostly at full 
strength)
*	Final equipment check
*	Mental preparation, meditation, prayer
*	Review the plan one more time
*	Discuss backup contingencies
*	Something else?
Kessa is sharpening her daggers methodically-her pre-mission ritual.
Cyrus is holding the Tempest Scepter, eyes closed, either praying or 
communing with the divine power within it.
What do you do?
How much storage space do I have in the Bags of Holding?
Dec 9
BAGS OF HOLDING - CAPACITY CHECK
Good question. Let me check your inventory.
From the Velthrax (green dragon) loot, you acquired 2x Bags of Holding.
Bag of Holding specifications:
*	Interior space: 64 cubic feet (roughly 4 feet in diameter sphere)
*	Weight capacity: 500 pounds
*	Weight of bag itself: 15 pounds regardless of contents
*	Items placed inside weigh nothing while stored
Current distribution: Looking through the campaign logs, the Bags of 
Holding were acquired but I don't see specific notes about which party 
member carries which bag or what's currently stored in them.
Likely distribution:
*	One bag carried by Johannes (party leader, holds communal equipment)
*	One bag carried by Kessa (backup storage, valuable loot)
Probable contents:
*	Rope, climbing gear, adventuring supplies
*	Spare weapons, ammunition
*	Valuable loot not currently needed (gems, art objects, etc.)
*	Medical supplies beyond what you carry on person
*	Food, water rations
*	Spare clothing
*	Possibly the Pearl of Power (unattunned)
*	Various magical items not currently in use
Available space: Given typical adventuring load, each bag probably 
has 300-400 pounds of available capacity remaining-plenty of room.
 
WHY DO YOU ASK?
Are you thinking of using a Bag of Holding for:
1.	Storing Lucien's body? (Conceal the assassination evidence 
completely-body disappears, no one finds it during the storm chaos)
2.	Emergency equipment storage? (Additional supplies for the 
mission)
3.	Escape contingency? (Store evidence, valuables, or other items)
4.	Something else?
If you're thinking of storing Lucien's body: That's actually brilliant. A 
corpse in a Bag of Holding would completely vanish from the scene. When the 
storm hits and ships sink, Lucien simply disappears-presumed drowned/lost 
at sea, body never recovered. No evidence of assassination at all.
However, there's a gruesome consideration: A Bag of Holding has a 
10-minute air supply for breathing creatures. A corpse doesn't breathe, so 
that's not an issue. But you'd need to fit Lucien's body through the bag's 
opening (roughly 2 feet diameter). Depending on his size/armor, that might be 
tight but manageable if you're not gentle about it.
What's your thinking?
And the body is preserved so we can use it somewhere else to our benefit.
Dec 9
STRATEGIC CORPSE PRESERVATION
Ah. Now that's thinking several moves ahead.
You're right-a Bag of Holding essentially creates a time-locked preservation 
state. No air circulation, no decomposition, no scavengers. Lucien's body 
stored in the bag would remain in whatever condition you placed it in, 
essentially indefinitely.
Potential uses for a preserved Highlord corpse:
1. INTELLIGENCE VALUE
*	His equipment (magical items, documents, maps, orders)
*	Command codes, passwords, intelligence on his person
*	Letters, journals, strategic plans
*	Could provide insight into Dragon Army operations
2. DIPLOMATIC LEVERAGE
*	Return body to Dragon Army for concessions/prisoner exchanges
*	Proof of his death for bounties or political negotiations
*	Use as bargaining chip with other factions
3. PROOF OF CAPABILITY
*	Show resistance allies you eliminated a Dragon Army Highlord
*	Demonstrate operational competence to skeptical commanders
*	Physical evidence of your mission's success
4. MAGICAL/DIVINE USES
*	Cyrus can cast Speak with Dead (via Amulet of the Depths, 1/day)
*	Interrogate Lucien's corpse for intelligence (5 questions, truthful 
answers)
*	Information about Dragon Army plans, weaknesses, command structure
*	Possibly repeat this multiple times over weeks
5. PREVENTING DRAGON ARMY RECOVERY
*	If they find and recover his body, they might resurrect him (high-level 
clerics)
*	Keeping the body denies them that option
*	Also prevents them from using Speak with Dead on him
 
REVISED ASSASSINATION APPROACH
So the sequence becomes:
After killing Lucien:
1.	Kessa kills him cleanly (throat cut, quick, professional)
2.	Immediately strip his body of:
*	Cloak of Displacement (magical)
*	Ring of Protection (magical)
*	Any documents, orders, maps on his person
*	Command insignia, seals, keys
3.	Place corpse in Bag of Holding (fold/compress as needed to fit)
4.	Clean up any blood evidence
5.	Arrange quarters to look undisturbed (close windows, straighten 
furniture)
6.	Proceed with Elara extraction
Result when storm hits:
*	Lucien's quarters appear empty
*	No body found in the wreckage
*	Dragon Army assumes he was washed overboard, body lost at sea
*	No evidence of assassination whatsoever
*	Meanwhile, you have his intact corpse, equipment, and any intelligence 
he was carrying
 
SPEAK WITH DEAD APPLICATIONS
This is particularly clever given Cyrus's capabilities:
Amulet of the Depths grants: Speak with Dead 1/day
Spell specifics:
*	Target: Corpse with mouth
*	Duration: 10 minutes
*	Questions: 5 per casting
*	Answers: Must be truthful (corpse knows what it knew in life)
*	Limitations: Corpse not obligated to be helpful, may be evasive
Intelligence you could extract from Lucien's corpse over multiple 
days:
*	Dragon Army fleet composition and capabilities
*	Other Highlords' locations and plans
*	Strategic objectives beyond Ak-Thyln invasion
*	Command structure and chain of command
*	Magical defenses and security protocols
*	Locations of prisoners, supply depots, garrisons
*	Information about Verminaard, the Dragon Highlords' supreme 
commander
You could potentially interrogate the corpse every day for weeks, extracting 
five new pieces of intelligence each time.
 
EQUIPMENT HAUL
Lucien's magical items are significant:
Cloak of Displacement (Rare, requires attunement)
*	Attackers have disadvantage on attack rolls against you
*	Extremely valuable defensive item
*	Worth ~5,000-8,000 gp
Ring of Protection (Rare, requires attunement)
*	+1 AC and +1 to saving throws
*	Valuable but less unique
*	Worth ~3,000-5,000 gp
Plus whatever else he's carrying:
*	Command insignia (could be used for impersonation)
*	Orders and maps (immediate tactical intelligence)
*	Personal effects (letters, journals, anything incriminating)
*	Keys or tokens (access to Dragon Army facilities)
*	Coin purse (probably several hundred gold)
Total value: 8,000-13,000 gp in magical items alone, plus intelligence worth 
far more.
 
KESSA'S PROFESSIONAL OPINION
When you mention the plan to store the body, Kessa grins widely.
"Now that's thinking like a professional. Kill the target, take 
everything valuable, disappear the evidence, and keep the corpse 
for later use. It's elegant."
She pulls out one of the Bags of Holding. "I'll handle the body storage. 
I've done this before-you'd be surprised how many bodies you can 
fit in one of these if you're not squeamish about folding."
"We'll need to work fast though," she adds. "Kill, loot, bag, clean-
probably takes 2-3 minutes total. Then we move on Elara's cabin 
while the Essence of Ether is still lingering in the air, before anyone 
notices anything wrong."
 
CYRUS'S PERSPECTIVE
The cleric looks thoughtful, perhaps slightly uncomfortable, but nods.
"It's... practical. Lucien's body becomes an intelligence asset rather 
than just a corpse. And denying the Dragon Army the ability to 
recover and possibly resurrect him is tactically sound."
He pauses. "I'll use Speak with Dead carefully-respectfully, even. 
He was our enemy, but he's also a soul that's passed on. The spell 
compels truth but not cooperation. If his spirit resists, we won't 
learn much."
"Still," Cyrus admits, "the intelligence we could gain-locations of 
other prisoners, Dragon Army plans, strategic weaknesses-could 
save many lives. That justifies the... irregularity of keeping his 
corpse."
 
FINAL PLAN CONFIRMATION
PHASE 1: INFILTRATION, ASSASSINATION & EXTRACTION 
(Midnight-1 AM)
1.	Underwater approach to Tiamat's Wrath
2.	Kessa enters via discharge chute
3.	Johannes deploys Essence of Ether via Mage Hand in Lucien's quarters
4.	Lucien unconscious within 10 seconds
5.	Kessa enters quarters, executes Lucien (throat cut)
6.	Strip body of equipment and documents (1-2 minutes)
7.	Store corpse in Bag of Holding (1 minute)
8.	Clean blood evidence, arrange room to appear undisturbed
9.	Move to officer's cabin, neutralize guard (Rope of Entanglement, non-
lethal preferred)
10.	Authenticate to Elara with locket and passphrase
11.	Extract Elara via stern windows to boat
12.	Row to shore, transport to Stormbreaker
13.	Secure Elara, sail offshore
PHASE 2: FLEET DESTRUCTION (3-4 AM)
1.	Stormbreaker at 5-6 miles range
2.	Cyrus invokes Storm's Fury via Tempest Scepter
3.	Hurricane targets ships-drive onto rocks, shatter hulls, break masts
4.	Sailors abandon ship, swim for shore (survivors possible)
5.	Fleet completely destroyed, invasion impossible
6.	Depart for Haven during chaos
PHASE 3: INTELLIGENCE EXPLOITATION (Following Days)
1.	Cyrus uses Speak with Dead on Lucien's corpse daily
2.	Extract strategic intelligence, prisoner locations, Dragon Army plans
3.	Share intelligence with Haven command and resistance network
4.	Possibly use corpse for diplomatic leverage later
 
CURRENT STATUS
Time: 10:20 PM 
Location: The Fishwife, private room 
Preparation time remaining: 85 minutes until departure
Equipment ready:
*	Essence of Ether (assassination tool)
*	Antidote (emergency revival)
*	Dreamless Rest poison (backup)
*	Silver locket (Elara authentication)
*	Rope of Entanglement (guard restraint)
*	2x Bags of Holding (corpse storage + general use)
*	2x Dimension Door scrolls (emergency escape)
*	Full spell slots and abilities
The plan is set. All contingencies considered.
 
How do you spend the remaining 85 minutes before departure?
1.	Short rest (recover Hit Dice if needed, attune/re-attune items)
2.	Mental preparation (meditation, prayer, focus)
3.	Equipment final check (ensure everything is accessible, 
waterproofed)
4.	Review contingencies (what if scenarios, backup plans)
5.	Something else?
Kessa is methodically checking her gear-daggers sharp, Rope coiled properly, 
lock picks ready.
Cyrus is in quiet prayer, one hand on the Tempest Scepter, preparing for the 
weight of what's to come.
What do you do?
We wait and let Lauranna control the questioning. And the body can be left 
somewhere that inconveniences others, like suggesting Lucien was involved in 
nefarious activities against the Dragon Army, etc. Lots of options.
Dec 9
STRATEGIC CORPSE APPLICATIONS
You're thinking like a true intelligence operative now.
"We don't interrogate the body ourselves," you clarify to Cyrus and 
Kessa. "We bring it to Laurana. Let Haven's intelligence network 
handle the Speak with Dead questioning-they'll know what to ask, 
what intelligence gaps need filling. They have the strategic 
overview we don't."
Cyrus nods with visible relief. "That's... actually much better. Laurana 
and her staff are trained in intelligence gathering. They'll extract 
far more useful information than I would improvising questions in 
the field."
Kessa grins. "Plus it keeps us operationally clean. We're the strike 
team-infiltrate, eliminate, extract. Haven's intelligence section 
handles exploitation of captured assets. Proper division of labor."
"And the corpse itself has other uses," you continue. "We could plant 
it somewhere that implicates Lucien in activities against the 
Dragon Army. Make it look like he was collaborating with 
resistance forces, or embezzling, or plotting against other 
Highlords. Sow discord in their command structure."
 
POTENTIAL DISINFORMATION OPERATIONS
Kessa's professional interest is clearly piqued. "Okay, I like where this is 
going. Some options:"
Option 1: The Traitor
*	Plant Lucien's body in a resistance safe house with forged documents
*	Make it appear he was secretly negotiating with the resistance
*	Dragon Army finds their Highlord's corpse in enemy territory with 
"evidence" of collaboration
*	Result: Paranoia, internal investigations, trust issues in command 
structure
Option 2: The Power Grab
*	Plant evidence suggesting Lucien was plotting against Verminaard or 
other Highlords
*	Correspondence with rival factions, plans for coup
*	Result: Dragon Army high command suspects internal betrayal, focuses 
inward rather than on resistance
Option 3: The Scandal
*	Evidence of corruption, embezzlement, personal enrichment
*	Makes Lucien look like he was profiteering from the war
*	Result: Morale damage, troops question leadership integrity
Option 4: The Lover
*	Plant body with evidence of romantic entanglement with resistance 
operative
*	"Honeypot" scenario-makes Dragon Army question how much 
intelligence was compromised
*	Result: Security crackdowns, paranoia about infiltration
Option 5: Simple Disposal
*	Leave body in a location that's embarrassing but not specifically 
incriminating
*	Brothel, gambling den, drinking establishment
*	Result: Leadership looks incompetent, died ignobly rather than in 
combat
 
MARIS'S INTELLIGENCE PERSPECTIVE
The resistance contact has been listening quietly. Now she speaks up:
"Commander, if you're bringing a Dragon Army Highlord's corpse 
back to Haven, that's an intelligence goldmine. Lady Laurana will 
absolutely want to exploit it."
She taps the table thoughtfully. "But consider timing. If you plant the 
body somewhere incriminating before the storm hits, the Dragon 
Army might find it within days and start their internal crisis 
immediately-while they're also dealing with the fleet disaster. 
Maximum chaos."
"Alternatively, if you hold the body for weeks or months, you can 
deploy it whenever it's most strategically useful. Save it for when 
you need a specific distraction or when you want to demoralize 
them."
She looks at you directly. "My recommendation? Bring it to Laurana. 
Let her intelligence staff extract everything via Speak with Dead-
that takes priority. Then, once you've milked it for information, 
you can still use the corpse for disinformation later. Dead bodies 
keep indefinitely in a Bag of Holding."
 
STRATEGIC VALUE SUMMARY
Immediate value (Days 1-7):
*	Equipment stripped (8,000-13,000 gp in magical items)
*	Documents and orders (immediate tactical intelligence)
*	Speak with Dead interrogation (5 questions/day for as long as useful)
*	Information on Dragon Army strategy, prisoner locations, command 
structure
Medium-term value (Weeks 1-4):
*	Continued interrogation as new questions arise
*	Intelligence sharing with allied resistance cells
*	Proof of capability to other resistance factions
Long-term value (Months 1-6):
*	Disinformation plant when strategically optimal
*	Diplomatic leverage if needed
*	Continued denial of resurrection to Dragon Army
*	Morale effect on Dragon Army ("one of our Highlords simply vanished")
Kessa summarizes: "So basically, we're treating Lucien's corpse like any 
other captured asset-exploit for intelligence first, then repurpose for 
psychological operations later. It's professional, it's thorough, and it 
maximizes the value of a successful assassination."
 
FINAL OPERATIONAL DETAILS
Corpse handling procedure:
1.	Kill cleanly (throat cut, minimal blood, Kessa handles)
2.	Strip immediately (armor, weapons, magical items, documents-2 
minutes)
3.	Inventory quickly (Cyrus checks pockets, pouches, hidden 
compartments)
4.	Bag the body (Kessa folds/compresses into Bag of Holding-1 minute)
5.	Clean scene (wipe blood, straighten furniture, close windows)
6.	Total time: 3-5 minutes from kill to cleaned scene
Weight concern: Lucien in full plate armor: ~250-280 pounds Bag of 
Holding capacity: 500 pounds No problem. Plenty of room.
Evidence management:
*	Blood on Kessa's blade: Wipe clean immediately
*	Blood in quarters: Minimal if throat cut is precise; wipe surfaces
*	Lucien's possessions: All in Bag of Holding
*	Scene appearance: Quarters look empty/undisturbed, as if Lucien left 
briefly
When storm hits at 3 AM:
*	Empty quarters suggest Lucien was elsewhere on ship
*	Body never found in wreckage
*	Dragon Army assumes he drowned/was lost in the chaos
*	No evidence of foul play whatsoever
 
CYRUS'S FINAL BLESSING
The cleric stands, holding the Tempest Scepter with both hands. He speaks 
formally:
"Mishakal, goddess of healing and mercy, I ask your blessing on 
this mission. We go to free the innocent and stop an army of 
conquest. We will take a life tonight-that of Highlord Lucien-not 
from cruelty but from necessity. May his death serve the cause of 
freedom."
"Zeboim, Lady of Storms, you have granted us your Scepter and 
your blessing. We will use your power to break the chains of 
tyranny, to shatter the tools of conquest, and to give those caught 
in the storm the freedom to survive or perish by their own 
strength. May the tempest we call be righteous."
"And may all three of us return safely, with Elara freed and the 
threat to Ak-Thyln ended. So be it."
Kessa doesn't pray, but she nods respectfully. "Well said, Brother. Now 
let's go do the work."
 
DEPARTURE - 11:45 PM
Maris leads you through the back alleys of Flotsam to the eastern pier. A small 
boat waits-unmarked, dark wood, oars wrapped in cloth to muffle sound. 
Two hooded figures stand nearby-her people, the rowers.
"This is as far as I go," Maris says. "The boat will take you to within 
200 yards of Tiamat's Wrath. From there, you swim. When you're 
done, red flare if you need emergency extraction, green when 
you're clear. The boat will wait two hours maximum-after that, 
they assume you're dead or captured and they leave."
She hands you a dark lantern. "Signal with this when you're ready for 
pickup. Two flashes, pause, one flash. They'll row to you."
She clasps your hand firmly. "Bring Elara home, Commander. And give 
the Dragon Army hell."
 
THE APPROACH - MIDNIGHT
The boat cuts silently through the dark water. Flotsam's lights fade behind you 
as you move into the harbor proper. Ahead, you can see the dark shapes of the 
Dragon Army fleet-15 warships at anchor, including the massive silhouette 
of Tiamat's Wrath in the center.
Cyrus casts Water Breathing on all three of you (and the two rowers, just 
in case). The spell settles over you like a cool mist-suddenly, breathing water 
seems as natural as breathing air.
At 200 yards out, the rowers stop. "This is as close as we go," one 
whispers. "Good hunting."
You slip over the side into the black water. Kessa follows, then Cyrus. Your 
Cloak of Manta Ray activates immediately-your body streamlines, you feel 
completely at home in the water. Cyrus's Amulet of the Depths does the same 
for him. Kessa, with Water Breathing active, swims competently but slower 
than you two.
You descend to about 20 feet depth and begin swimming toward Tiamat's 
Wrath.
 
FINAL APPROACH
The flagship looms ahead-150 feet long, dark hull, three masts piercing the 
night sky. You can see lights on the main deck-lanterns, torches. Guards 
moving slowly, half-alert.
The stern faces northwest, exactly as Maris described. You can see the large 
stern windows of the captain's quarters-currently dark. No lights inside. 
Either Lucien is working in another part of the ship, or he's already retired for 
the night.
It's 12:15 AM. Guard shift change happened 15 minutes ago. Perfect timing.
You surface briefly, treading water in the shadow of the hull. Kessa and Cyrus 
join you. The three of you are invisible in the darkness, just three more 
shadows on black water.
You look up at the stern-20 feet of hull rising above the waterline, then the 
windows of the captain's quarters another 8 feet above that. The discharge 
chute from the privy opens about 6 feet above the waterline, a dark 
rectangular hole in the hull.
This is it. The operation begins now.
 
INFILTRATION SEQUENCE:
1.	Kessa uses Rope of Entanglement to climb to discharge chute (DC 10 
Athletics)
2.	Kessa enters privy via chute
3.	Johannes positions below stern windows with Mage Hand ready
4.	Johannes deploys Essence of Ether in Lucien's quarters
5.	Wait 15-20 seconds
6.	Kessa confirms unconsciousness, executes Lucien, loots body, bags 
corpse
7.	Kessa opens stern windows
8.	Johannes and Cyrus climb up and enter
9.	Proceed to Elara's extraction
Kessa whispers: "Ready when you are, Commander."
Cyrus grips his holy symbol: "Mishakal guide us."
You nod. "Let's bring Elara home."
 
Do you proceed as planned, or any last-minute adjustments?
Don't worry about that now. Let's create the corpse first, right?
Dec 9
INFILTRATION - PHASE 1
You're absolutely right. First things first-eliminate the target.
"Kessa, you're up," you whisper. "Get inside, position in the privy, 
signal when you're ready."
She nods, pulling out the Rope of Entanglement. She speaks the command 
word softly, and the rope animates, extending upward toward the discharge 
chute opening 6 feet above the waterline.
 
KESSA'S CLIMB
Athletics Check: 12 + 4 (DEX) = 16 (Success)
The rope secures itself to the edge of the chute opening, and Kessa climbs 
swiftly and silently. The wet hull provides almost no grip, but the magical rope 
does all the work-she ascends in seconds.
She reaches the chute opening-a dark rectangular hole, about 18 inches wide 
by 24 inches tall. She peers inside for a moment, listening carefully. Nothing. 
No sounds from within.
She slides into the chute.
It's as disgusting as expected-centuries of use (even if only the past few years 
under Dragon Army occupation), residue on the walls, the smell. But Kessa's a 
professional. She squeezes through the narrow passage-tight, uncomfortable, 
but manageable for someone her size and flexibility.
After about 8 feet of crawling upward at an angle, she emerges into the privy 
chamber.
 
INSIDE THE PRIVY
Kessa's Perception: 19 + 7 = 26 (Excellent)
The small room is exactly as Korvan described-maybe 4 feet by 6 feet, 
enclosed. A wooden bench with a hole cut in it (the "seat"), a small shelf with 
what might be washing cloths, a chamber pot for backup. Dark wood walls. No 
windows. One door leading to the main cabin.
She listens carefully at the door.
SOUND FROM BEYOND: Breathing. Deep, rhythmic, regular. Someone 
is asleep in the quarters beyond.
She hears one person. No conversation, no movement, no guards inside the 
cabin. Just one person sleeping.
Most likely Lucien, retired for the night as Maris predicted.
Kessa remains absolutely still, controlling her breathing. She carefully tests 
the door-it's not locked from this side (why would it be?). She could open it 
quietly if needed.
She moves back to the chute opening and signals down to you-a brief flash of 
her dark lantern, once. "Ready."
 
JOHANNES - MAGE HAND DEPLOYMENT
You're treading water below the stern windows, approximately 30 feet from 
the discharge chute where Kessa emerged. Perfect range for Mage Hand.
You can't see directly into Lucien's quarters from your position-the stern 
windows are above you, and they're dark. But you don't need to see. You know 
the layout from Korvan's briefing.
You cast Mage Hand.
The spectral, translucent hand materializes in the water next to you-barely 
visible even to you, completely invisible to anyone not actively looking for it. 
You will it upward, toward the stern windows.
The windows: Three large panes, roughly 3 feet by 4 feet each. They're the 
kind that swing outward on hinges-standard naval design for ventilation. 
Currently closed but not latched (Lucien wanted airflow, it's a warm night).
The Mage Hand reaches the center window. With careful manipulation, you 
have it press gently against the glass, finding the small gap where the window 
meets the frame. The hand slips through-barely, but it fits through gaps as 
narrow as 1 inch.
The hand is now inside Lucien's quarters.
You can't see what the hand sees-Mage Hand doesn't provide vision-but 
you know the general layout. The quarters are roughly 20 feet by 30 feet. 
Lucien's bed would be against the far wall, opposite the windows. The center 
of the room would be clear space-desk, chairs, maybe a table.
You retrieve the Essence of Ether vial from your waterproof pouch. 
Carefully, you have the Mage Hand return to the window gap, take the vial 
from your hand, and carry it back inside.
You direct it to float to approximately the center of the quarters-about 15 
feet from the windows, 10 feet from where you estimate Lucien's bed to be.
Then you have the hand drop the vial.
 
ESSENCE OF ETHER DEPLOYMENT
The vial falls approximately 4 feet and shatters on the wooden floor.
Inside the cabin:
The clear liquid spreads instantly, vaporizing on contact with air. The Essence 
of Ether becomes an invisible, odorless gas that disperses rapidly in a 15-foot 
radius.
CON SAVE for Lucien:
*	Lucien is a 12th-level Fighter (CON likely +3 to +5)
*	He's asleep (disadvantage? Or just unaware?)
*	DC 15
Rolling for Lucien's CON save: 11 + 4 = 15
He exactly meets the DC-but wait, he's asleep and unaware. He's not 
actively resisting. The gas enters his lungs with his natural breathing.
Reroll with disadvantage: 7 + 4 = 11 (FAIL)
The gas takes effect within 6 seconds (one round).
Lucien's already-sleeping form goes from natural sleep to deep, chemically-
induced unconsciousness. His breathing remains steady but becomes even 
deeper, slower. He's utterly insensible.
 
KESSA'S ENTRY - 20 SECONDS LATER
You count silently. Twenty seconds to ensure the gas has fully taken effect and 
settled.
Then you signal Kessa-two quick flashes of your dark lantern.
Inside the privy, Kessa sees your signal through the chute. She waits 
another five seconds (extra caution), then carefully, slowly opens the door 
from the privy to the main cabin.
Stealth Check: 18 + 11 = 29 (Exceptional)
The door opens silently. Kessa slips into Lucien's quarters.
 
LUCIEN'S QUARTERS - INTERIOR
Kessa's Darkvision reveals:
The cabin is well-appointed-much nicer than standard officer quarters. A 
large bed against the far wall. A desk covered in maps and documents. A 
weapons rack with a greatsword and spare armor. A sea chest. Several chairs 
around a small table.
And in the bed: Highlord Lucien.
He's a large man-probably 6'2", heavily muscled, even in sleep clearly a 
warrior. He's wearing a nightshirt, which makes things easier (no armor to 
deal with right now). His Cloak of Displacement is draped over a chair nearby. 
His Ring of Protection is on his finger (he never takes it off, even sleeping).
He's face-up, breathing deeply, completely unconscious.
Kessa approaches silently.
She draws one of her +1 ceremonial daggers-the one she always uses for 
this kind of work. Sharp, balanced, purpose-built.
She positions herself at the bedside. Professional assessment: throat exposed, 
carotid artery accessible, windpipe vulnerable. One cut, severing both, and 
he'll bleed out in seconds without ever waking.
She looks back toward the privy, toward where she knows you're waiting 
below. This is the moment. Once she does this, there's no going back.
She commits.
 
EXECUTION
Attack Roll (Lucien is unconscious, so this is an automatic critical 
hit):
Kessa's blade flashes once-a single, precise cut across Lucien's throat. The 
ceremonial dagger, ignoring necrotic resistance, cuts clean and deep. Carotid 
artery severed, windpipe opened, blood flows instantly.
Damage: (1d4+4) x 2 + sneak attack (3d6) x 2 = Critical hit on 
helpless target
But it doesn't matter. Lucien was unconscious from the gas, and now his 
throat is opened. He doesn't wake, doesn't struggle, doesn't even twitch. His 
body remains still, his deep breathing becomes a wet gurgle for just a moment, 
then stops entirely.
Highlord Lucien is dead.
Kessa holds position for ten seconds, watching for any sign of movement. 
Nothing. The Dragon Army Highlord, commander of the invasion fleet, is dead 
in his bed, executed without ever knowing danger was present.
She wipes her blade clean on the bed sheets, then immediately begins the next 
phase.
 
LOOTING THE BODY
Kessa moves with professional efficiency:
1. The Ring of Protection - She carefully removes it from his 
finger. Acquired.
2. The Cloak of Displacement - Draped over the chair, she folds it 
quickly. Acquired.
3. His clothing - She checks the nightshirt, finds nothing. Moves to the 
clothes he was wearing earlier, folded on another chair:
*	Command insignia (Dragon Army Highlord rank pins)
*	Coin purse (she hefts it-heavy, maybe 200-300 gold)
*	Small leather journal (personal notes, she doesn't read it now, just 
takes it)
*	Sealed orders (several folded parchments with wax seals)
*	Keys (ring of keys, various sizes-ship access, chests, quarters)
4. The desk - Quick sweep:
*	Maps (fleet deployment, coastal targets, strategic plans-she rolls them 
up)
*	More orders and correspondence (Dragon Army communications, 
she grabs them all)
*	Personal effects (miniature portrait of someone-family?, trinkets)
5. The sea chest - She tries the keys, finds the right one:
*	Additional coin (perhaps 500 gold in various denominations)
*	Backup weapons (quality, but not magical)
*	More documents (she doesn't sort, just takes everything that looks 
official)
Total looting time: 2 minutes.
 
BAGGING THE CORPSE
Now comes the unpleasant part.
Kessa pulls out the Bag of Holding. She spreads it open on the floor-the 
opening is about 2 feet in diameter.
Lucien's body is large and heavy, but Kessa's done this before. She drags him 
from the bed to the floor beside the bag. Then:
*	Folds his arms across his chest
*	Bends his legs at the knees
*	Essentially compresses him into the smallest profile possible
Then she begins feeding him into the Bag of Holding-head first, then 
shoulders (tight squeeze, but the bag's opening stretches slightly), then torso, 
then legs.
Strength Check: 13 + 1 = 14 (Success, but difficult)
It takes about 90 seconds of work, but she manages it. Lucien's entire 
corpse disappears into the extradimensional space of the Bag of Holding. The 
bag itself weighs 15 pounds regardless of contents.
She cinches it closed and secures it to her belt.
Highlord Lucien has been completely disappeared.
 
CLEANING THE SCENE
Blood evidence: There's blood on the bed sheets and some spatter on the 
floor near the bed. Kessa works quickly:
*	Strips the bloody top sheet, folds it, stuffs it in her pack (she'll dispose of 
it in the ocean later)
*	Wipes the floor with a cloth, getting most of the blood
*	Rearranges the bed to look slept-in but not bloody (pulls up the blanket 
to cover where the sheet was)
Furniture arrangement:
*	Returns the Cloak to approximately where it was (so its absence isn't 
immediately obvious)
*	Straightens the desk (hides the fact that documents are missing)
*	Closes the sea chest, locks it with the key
Overall appearance: Someone who glanced in quickly would think Lucien 
had gotten up and left-maybe to use the deck facilities, maybe called away for 
something. Not immediately alarming.
Total cleanup time: 1 minute.
 
TOTAL ELAPSED TIME: ~4-5 MINUTES
From the moment Kessa entered the quarters to now, approximately 5 
minutes have passed. The guard shift change was at midnight-it's now 
roughly 12:20 AM. The guard outside Elara's cabin has been at his post for 
20 minutes and is settling into the routine of a long, boring watch.
 
OPENING THE WINDOWS
Kessa moves to the stern windows. She unlatches them quietly and swings all 
three open-fresh night air flows in, dispersing the last traces of Essence of 
Ether gas.
She leans out slightly and signals down to you with her dark lantern: Three 
quick flashes. "All clear. Come up."
 
JOHANNES AND CYRUS - JOINING KESSA
You see the signal. Mission phase 1 complete-Lucien eliminated, 
body secured, scene cleaned.
Now you and Cyrus need to climb the stern hull to the open windows and join 
Kessa inside.
The climb: 28 feet total (20 feet of hull + 8 feet to window level). Wet wood, 
no handholds except some decorative carvings.
You have your Rope of Entanglement (or Kessa can lower hers). With the 
magical rope, this is trivial.
Climbing with rope assistance:
*	Johannes: Athletics +3, with rope advantage = automatic success
*	Cyrus: Athletics +1, with rope advantage = automatic success
You both ascend quickly and quietly, pulling yourselves up hand over hand. 
Within 30 seconds, you're climbing through the stern windows into Lucien's 
quarters.
 
INSIDE LUCIEN'S QUARTERS
You step into the cabin, water dripping from your clothes. Cyrus follows.
Kessa is there, the Bag of Holding secured at her belt, a pile of looted items on 
the desk ready to be distributed.
The quarters are empty. No body. No blood visible (it's dark, and Kessa 
cleaned well). Just a cabin that looks like its occupant stepped out briefly.
"Lucien is in the bag," Kessa whispers. "All his gear, all his 
documents, everything. The scene is clean. No one will know he's 
dead until they go looking for him-and by then, we'll be long 
gone."
Cyrus looks around, his expression conflicted but determined. "May his soul 
find peace. Now-let's free Elara and finish this."
You nod. Phase 1 complete. Phase 2: Extract Elara.
 
STATUS UPDATE:
*	Time: 12:22 AM
*	Location: Lucien's quarters, Tiamat's Wrath
*	Lucien: Dead, body secured in Bag of Holding
*	Loot acquired: Cloak of Displacement, Ring of Protection, maps, 
orders, journal, command insignia, keys, ~800 gold, various documents
*	Party status: All three present in quarters, ready to proceed
*	Next target: Elara, held in adjacent officer cabin, one guard outside
The adjacent officer cabin is through an internal door on the 
eastern wall of Lucien's quarters. Between you and that door is the 
passageway where one guard is posted.
How do you handle the guard?
1.	Rope of Entanglement (restrain non-lethally, DC 15 DEX save)
2.	Sneak past (if possible-unlikely with guard actively watching the 
door)
3.	Kessa assassinates (silent kill, but more lethal than your preference)
4.	Incapacitate with remaining Essence of Ether (if you brought 
more than one vial-did you?)
5.	Something else?
What's your approach?
Rope of Entanglement
Dec 9
HANDLING THE GUARD
You move to the internal door connecting Lucien's quarters to the passageway 
where the guard is posted. Kessa readies the Rope of Entanglement, 
whispering the command word to prepare it.
"I'll open the door quietly," Kessa breathes. "The guard will be facing 
Elara's cabin door, back partially to us. I'll command the rope the 
moment we have line of sight."
You and Cyrus position yourselves to either side, ready to rush in if the rope 
fails or if the guard calls out.
 
OPENING THE DOOR
Kessa's Stealth: 16 + 11 = 27 (Excellent)
The internal door has a simple latch-no lock (why would there be? It's 
internal to the officer quarters area). Kessa lifts it with agonizing slowness, 
ensuring no click, no scrape of metal.
The door swings open an inch. Two inches. She peers through the gap.
The passageway: Narrow corridor, maybe 5 feet wide, 10 feet long. Dim 
lantern light from a single lamp hanging on the wall. At the far end: a closed 
door (Elara's cabin). Standing in front of that door: one guard.
He's a Dragon Army regular-chainmail, shortsword at his hip, spear leaning 
against the wall next to him. He's facing the door he's guarding, standing at a 
loose attention. Not particularly alert (it's a boring watch), but awake and 
functional.
His back is three-quarters to you. Perfect.
Kessa opens the door another foot-wide enough for action.
 
ROPE OF ENTANGLEMENT - ACTIVATION
Kessa speaks the command word firmly but quietly: "Ensnare."
The magical rope animates instantly, shooting forward like a living serpent. It 
extends 20 feet in a fraction of a second, its target clear: the guard.
Attack Roll: 14 + 7 (Kessa's DEX for magical item) = 21 (Hit)
The rope wraps around the guard's torso, arms, and legs in a tight, constrictive 
coil before he can react.
Guard's DEX Save: 9 + 2 = 11 (FAIL vs DC 15)
The guard is Restrained-completely. His arms are pinned to his sides, his 
legs bound together, the rope constricting with magical strength. He opens his 
mouth to shout-
 
SILENCING THE GUARD
Kessa is already moving. She crosses the 10 feet in a heartbeat (movement + 
dash if needed), clamps her hand over the guard's mouth before sound can 
escape.
Athletics Check (contested): Kessa 15 + 1 = 16 vs Guard's Strength 
12 + 1 = 13 (Success)
The guard's attempted shout becomes a muffled grunt against her palm. His 
eyes are wide with panic, but he's completely immobilized-the magical rope is 
far stronger than he is.
Kessa whispers harshly in his ear: "Quiet, or you die. Nod if you 
understand."
The guard, seeing Johannes and Cyrus now entering the passageway behind 
Kessa (you in studded leather with a trident, Cyrus in clerical robes), realizes 
he's outnumbered, outmatched, and completely helpless.
He nods frantically.
 
QUESTIONING THE GUARD
Kessa keeps her hand over his mouth, but eases the pressure slightly. "I'm 
going to move my hand. If you scream, you die instantly. If you 
cooperate, you live. Understand?"
Another frantic nod.
She removes her hand slowly, her dagger now visible in her other hand-a 
clear threat.
The guard whispers hoarsely: "Don't kill me. Please. I'm just following 
orders. I don't even know why the girl's locked up."
You step forward, keeping your voice low. "We're here for Elara. We're 
taking her. You have two choices: cooperate and live, or resist and 
die. There's no third option."
The guard swallows hard. "Take her. I don't care. Just... don't kill me. 
I've got a family back in Kalaman. I'm conscripted-didn't even 
want to join the Dragon Army."
Cyrus's expression softens slightly. "Then you have no reason to die 
tonight. Is Elara in that cabin? Is she alone?"
"Yes," the guard whispers quickly. "She's alone. Door's locked. I have 
the key." He nods toward his belt, where a single key hangs.
 
SECURING THE GUARD
Kessa retrieves the key, then looks at you. "What do we do with him? 
Rope can hold him for an hour if we command it, but someone 
might come by on rounds."
Options:
1.	Leave him restrained here (rope holds him, you gag him, someone 
will find him eventually but not immediately)
2.	Knock him unconscious (non-lethal blow, he wakes in 10-20 
minutes)
3.	Move him into Lucien's quarters (hide him there, further from 
discovery)
4.	Use Dreamless Rest poison (peaceful death-but he's a conscript 
who's cooperating)
5.	Something else?
The guard is watching you with terrified hope. He clearly wants to live. He's 
young-maybe early twenties-and his fear is genuine.
Cyrus speaks quietly: "He's a conscript. He's cooperating. We should 
spare him if we can."
What do you do with the guard?
Restrain him with regular rope and gag him and leave him in Elara's room 
once we get her out
Dec 9
SECURING THE GUARD - NON-LETHAL
"We'll restrain him with regular rope and leave him in Elara's 
cabin after we extract her," you decide. "Gagged, bound, but alive. By 
the time anyone finds him, we'll be long gone."
Cyrus nods approvingly. "Merciful and practical."
The guard's relief is palpable. "Thank you. Thank you. I won't say 
anything, I swear-"
Kessa puts a finger to his lips. "Quiet. You'll live, but only if you stay 
silent and don't struggle."
She retrieves regular rope from her pack (standard adventuring gear, 50 feet). 
While the Rope of Entanglement holds him immobilized, she works quickly:
*	Binds his hands behind his back (tight, professional knots)
*	Binds his ankles together
*	Tears a strip from his own shirt and gags him firmly (can't speak, can 
barely make noise)
*	Commands the Rope of Entanglement to release him
The magical rope uncoils and returns to Kessa's hand, coiling itself neatly. The 
guard remains bound with regular rope, sitting against the wall, gagged and 
helpless but breathing easily.
"We'll move you in a moment," you tell him quietly. "Stay calm."
He nods, his eyes still frightened but grateful.
 
ENTERING ELARA'S CABIN
Kessa uses the key the guard provided. The lock turns smoothly-well-
maintained, barely a sound.
The door swings open.
Inside Elara's cabin:
The room is small-maybe 10 feet by 12 feet. A narrow bed, a single chair, a 
small desk, a chamber pot. No windows (it's an interior officer cabin). A single 
dim lantern provides minimal light.
And on the bed, sitting up suddenly at the sound of the door opening: Elara.
She's in her mid-twenties, dark hair disheveled, wearing a simple dress that's 
seen better days. She's thin-malnourished from two weeks of minimal 
rations-but her eyes are sharp, alert, and immediately terrified.
She sees three armed strangers entering her locked cabin and her first instinct 
is to scramble backward on the bed, opening her mouth to scream-
 
AUTHENTICATION - IMMEDIATE
You move quickly, raising one hand in a peaceful gesture while pulling out 
the silver locket with your other hand.
"Elara," you say firmly but gently, keeping your voice low. "We're here 
from your mother. We're getting you out."
You hold up the locket where she can see it in the lamplight. The sailing ship 
engraving catches the light. Her eyes fix on it immediately-recognition, 
shock, hope all flashing across her face.
"Your mother remembers the storms you weathered together," you 
say clearly, delivering the authentication phrase.
Elara's hand goes to her mouth. Her eyes fill with tears. "That's... that's my 
grandmother's locket. Mother said it was lost when they took me."
Cyrus steps forward, his clerical robes and holy symbol visible. "Lady 
Sharane gave it to our resistance contact specifically for this 
moment. To prove we're truly here to save you. We're not Dragon 
Army. We're not here to hurt you."
Kessa adds quietly: "But we need to move fast. Can you walk? Can you 
swim if needed?"
Elara is trembling-adrenaline, fear, hope, exhaustion all hitting her at 
once. "I... I can try. Are you really taking me out of here? Is this 
real?"
"This is real," you confirm. "But we have maybe ten minutes before 
someone notices something's wrong. We need to go now."
 
PREPARING ELARA
Elara stands shakily. She's weak-two weeks of minimal food, stress, 
confinement-but she's mobile.
"Do you have shoes?" Kessa asks practically.
Elara nods, slipping on worn shoes that were under the bed. "What's 
happening? Where's Lucien? Where's the guard?"
"The guard is cooperative and will be left here, bound but 
unharmed," you say, avoiding the Lucien question for now. "You'll 
understand everything once we're safe. Right now, we need to get 
you off this ship."
You hand her the locket. "This belongs to you."
Elara takes it with shaking hands, clutching it like a lifeline. "Thank you. 
Gods, thank you."
 
MOVING THE GUARD
Kessa and you drag the bound, gagged guard into Elara's cabin. He doesn't 
resist-he knows cooperation is his only chance.
You position him on the floor, back against the wall. Visible, but not 
immediately obvious if someone just glances through the door quickly.
Kessa checks his bonds one more time-secure, but not cutting off 
circulation. "You'll be found eventually," she tells him. "Just be 
patient. And when they ask what happened, tell them you never 
saw our faces clearly. Understood?"
The guard nods frantically.
Cyrus adds: "When this is over, if you can, leave the Dragon Army. 
Go home to your family. You don't have to serve tyranny."
Another nod.
 
EXTRACTION ROUTE
You close and lock Elara's cabin door from the outside, leaving the guard 
inside. To anyone checking casually, it looks like everything's normal-door 
locked, guard presumably at his post.
The four of you move back through the passageway into Lucien's quarters.
Elara sees the well-appointed cabin, the empty bed, the open stern 
windows. "This is Lucien's cabin. Where is he?"
"Gone," Kessa says simply. "He won't be a problem anymore."
Elara's eyes widen slightly-she's smart enough to understand the 
implication-but she doesn't ask further questions. Some part of her doesn't 
want to know the details.
 
THE WATER BREATHING SITUATION
You realize the issue: Cyrus's Water Breathing spell is still active (cast 
at 11:45 PM, lasts 8 hours, so good until ~7:45 AM). It was cast on you, Kessa, 
Cyrus, and the two rowers.
But not on Elara.
She wasn't part of the original plan parameters.
Options:
1.	Cyrus casts Water Breathing again (as a 3rd-level spell, he has 
multiple 3rd-level slots available)
2.	Use the Potion of Water Breathing (party-sized, grants 8 hours to 
up to 10 creatures-perfect for adding Elara)
3.	Carry Elara above water (she doesn't swim, you tow her at the 
surface-more visible, riskier)
Which do you choose?
Cyrus says: "I can cast Water Breathing again-it's a ritual, takes ten 
minutes. Or we use the potion immediately and move now."
Time check: 12:28 AM. You've been aboard roughly 13 minutes. The longer 
you stay, the higher the risk of discovery.
What's your call?
Cloak of mantra, which you keep forgetting
Dec 9
WATER BREATHING - CORRECTED
You're absolutely right-my apologies for the continued oversight.
Cloak of Manta Ray (worn by Johannes):
*	Grants water breathing (unlimited duration while worn)
*	Swim speed 60 feet
*	You've been using it this entire mission
So the actual water breathing situation is:
Currently water breathing capable:
*	Johannes: Cloak of Manta Ray (permanent effect while worn)
*	Kessa: Water Breathing spell (7+ hours remaining)
*	Cyrus: Amulet of the Depths (permanent swim speed + water 
breathing)
Not water breathing capable:
*	Elara: No magical equipment, no spell effect
 
SOLUTION: GIVE ELARA THE CLOAK
The simplest solution: you remove your Cloak of Manta Ray and give it to 
Elara.
"Here," you say, unclasping the cloak from your shoulders. "Put this on. It 
will let you breathe underwater and swim easily."
Elara takes it hesitantly. "Underwater? We're swimming out?"
"It's the safest way," Kessa explains. "Under the hull, into the dark 
water, away from patrol boats. The cloak will make it feel natural-
you won't drown, you won't struggle."
Elara wraps the cloak around herself. The moment it settles on her shoulders, 
the magic activates-you can see the change in her expression as suddenly the 
concept of breathing water becomes instinctively comprehensible rather than 
terrifying.
"Oh," she breathes. "That's... that's incredible. I can feel it. I know I 
can breathe underwater now."
"Good," you confirm. "Stay close to us. We'll guide you to the boat."
 
YOUR SWIMMING CAPABILITY WITHOUT THE 
CLOAK
Without the Cloak of Manta Ray, you're back to normal swimming:
*	Swimming speed: Half your normal movement (15 feet per round 
underwater)
*	Water breathing: You still have Cyrus's Water Breathing spell active 
(cast at 11:45 PM, good until 7:45 AM)
*	You can breathe and move underwater, just not as fast as before
Cyrus: Amulet of the Depths (swim speed, water breathing) Kessa: Water 
Breathing spell (no swim speed, but can swim normally) Elara: Cloak of 
Manta Ray (60 ft swim speed, water breathing)
Actually, this is perfect: Elara, who's weak and exhausted, gets the 
enhanced swimming capability. You, who are strong and experienced, can 
manage with normal swimming. Cyrus has his own swim speed. Kessa is the 
slowest but competent.
 
ESCAPE SEQUENCE
The four of you move to the stern windows. It's now 12:30 AM-you've been 
aboard approximately 15 minutes.
"We're going through the windows, into the water below," you 
explain to Elara. "It's a 28-foot drop to the water. We'll lower you 
with the rope first, then we'll follow."
Elara looks at the dark water below, clearly frightened but 
determined. "Okay. I trust you."
Kessa secures the Rope of Entanglement to the window frame and lowers it 
down. "Wrap it around your waist, hold tight, we'll lower you 
smoothly."
 
LOWERING ELARA
Elara climbs out the window awkwardly-she's not athletic, and she's weak 
from captivity-but with the rope supporting her weight, she descends safely.
The 28-foot drop takes about 15 seconds. She reaches the water, submerges 
slightly, then bobs back up-the cloak's magic making the transition from air 
to water seamless. She's breathing water as naturally as air.
Her eyes are wide with wonder despite the circumstances. "It works. I'm 
breathing. I'm actually breathing water."
"Stay there," you call down quietly. "We're coming down."
 
PARTY DESCENT
Kessa goes next-quick, professional, hand-over-hand down the rope. She 
reaches the water in seconds.
Cyrus follows-slower, more careful, but competent. His Amulet activates fully 
once he's in the water, granting him confident swimming ability.
You go last. Without the cloak, you're aware of the water's resistance more 
than before, but you're still a strong swimmer and you have magical water 
breathing. You descend the rope, release it, and submerge.
The Rope of Entanglement, commanded by Kessa, detaches from the window 
frame and returns to her hand, coiling itself neatly.
 
UNDERWATER ESCAPE
The four of you are now in the water at the stern of Tiamat's Wrath, 28 feet 
below the captain's quarters.
"We swim northwest, away from the harbor traffic, to where the 
boat is waiting," you whisper. "Stay together. Stay quiet. If patrol 
boats come near, we dive deep and hide."
Elara nods, still clutching her grandmother's locket even underwater.
You begin swimming-away from the massive hull of the flagship, into the 
dark water of the harbor.
Stealth check for the group (everyone rolls, lowest determines if 
you're detected):
*	Johannes: 8 + 5 = 13
*	Kessa: 18 + 11 = 29
*	Cyrus: 11 + 2 = 13
*	Elara: 7 + 0 = 7 (she's inexperienced, nervous, splashing slightly)
Group total: 7 (Elara is the weak link)
 
PATROL BOAT ENCOUNTER
About 100 feet from Tiamat's Wrath, you see lantern light above-a Dragon 
Army patrol boat, rowing slowly through the harbor, two soldiers with a 
hooded lantern scanning the water.
They're maybe 40 feet away, moving perpendicular to your path.
Elara panics slightly- she's never done this before, she's stressed, she 
kicks harder than necessary, creating ripples and disturbance on the surface.
One of the patrol soldiers stops rowing. "Hold up. You see that? 
Movement in the water."
The lantern swings toward your position.
 
REACTION OPTIONS:
1.	Dive deep immediately (get below their lantern's effective range, 
~20 feet down)
2.	Freeze and hold still (hope they dismiss it as fish or debris)
3.	Cyrus casts a spell (illusion, distraction, something to misdirect 
them)
4.	Kessa takes direct action (eliminate the patrol boat-lethal but 
effective)
5.	Something else?
Time is critical. The lantern is swinging toward you. In about 5 seconds, 
they'll have clear line of sight to your group.
What do you do?
But you already cast water breathing on all of us, so Elara can use the cloak
Dec 9
CORRECTED - WATER BREATHING STATUS
You're absolutely right. I apologize for the confusion.
Cyrus cast Water Breathing earlier at 11:45 PM on:
*	Johannes
*	Kessa
*	Cyrus
*	The two rowers
*	And himself (he can include up to 10 creatures)
The spell lasts 8 hours (until ~7:45 AM), so everyone is already covered.
Current water breathing status:
*	Johannes: Water Breathing spell (6+ hours remaining) + you keep 
your Cloak of Manta Ray
*	Kessa: Water Breathing spell (6+ hours remaining)
*	Cyrus: Water Breathing spell + Amulet of the Depths (swim speed)
*	Elara: Needs water breathing
Solution: Cyrus can simply include Elara in the existing spell effect by 
touching her and extending the magic (the spell allows this), OR he can cast it 
again as a ritual (10 minutes), OR you can give her the cloak.
Actually, the simplest approach:
You give Elara the Cloak of Manta Ray (she needs the swim speed more 
than you do since she's weak), and Cyrus extends his Water Breathing spell to 
include her with a touch (the spell specifically allows the caster to include 
additional creatures).
"Elara, put this on," you say, handing her the cloak. "Brother Cyrus will 
make sure you can breathe underwater."
Cyrus touches Elara's shoulder, and the Water Breathing magic extends to 
her. She gasps slightly as the sensation settles over her.
Then she wraps the Cloak of Manta Ray around herself, and immediately her 
body streamlines, the swimming capability becoming instinctive.
Current status:
*	Johannes: Water Breathing spell, normal swimming speed
*	Kessa: Water Breathing spell, normal swimming speed
*	Cyrus: Water Breathing spell + Amulet swim speed
*	Elara: Water Breathing spell + Cloak of Manta Ray (60 ft swim speed)
This is actually optimal: The weakest, most exhausted person (Elara) gets 
the best swimming capability.
 
BACK TO THE PATROL BOAT ENCOUNTER
You're 100 feet from Tiamat's Wrath, swimming toward the extraction point. 
The patrol boat is 40 feet away, soldiers scanning with lantern after Elara 
created some surface disturbance.
"Hold up. You see that? Movement in the water."
The lantern swings toward your position.
 
REACTION OPTIONS:
1.	Dive deep immediately (get below their lantern's effective range, 
~20 feet down)
2.	Freeze and hold still (hope they dismiss it as fish or debris)
3.	Cyrus casts a spell (illusion, distraction, something to misdirect 
them)
4.	Kessa takes direct action (eliminate the patrol boat-lethal but 
effective)
5.	Something else?
The lantern will illuminate your position in about 5 seconds.
What do you do?
I cast minor illusion and have a large fish jump out of the water near the boat, 
mimicking the sounds we made...
Dec 9
MISDIRECTION - MINOR ILLUSION
Quick thinking. You focus your will and cast Minor Illusion.
Spell parameters:
*	Range: 30 feet (the patrol boat is 40 feet away-just outside your range)
*	You need line of sight
*	Creates sound or image (you're creating both-visual of fish + sound of 
splash)
Range issue: The patrol boat is 40 feet away, which is outside your 30-foot 
range for Minor Illusion.
But- you can move closer underwater while casting. You kick forward 
quickly, closing the distance to 25 feet while maintaining your position below 
the surface.
 
THE ILLUSION
You create the image and sound of a large fish-maybe a 3-foot tarpon or 
similar harbor fish-breaking the surface about 15 feet from the patrol boat, 
away from your actual position.
SPLASH.
The illusion fish leaps from the water with realistic sound-the smack of 
water, the thrashing movement, exactly the kind of disturbance that would 
draw attention from bored guards.
The two soldiers' heads snap toward the sound.
"There! Big one!" one of them says, pointing with the lantern.
The light swings away from your group, focusing instead on where your 
illusory fish "jumped."
"Just a fish," the other soldier says with clear relief. "Damn thing 
startled me."
"Caught a lot of those this morning. Harbor's full of 'em with all the 
ships dumping food scraps."
They laugh, the tension breaking. The lantern continues scanning-but it's 
now focused in the wrong direction, away from where you actually are.
Deception check (your spell vs their Perception):
Minor Illusion is convincing enough for casual observation. The soldiers 
aren't actively suspicious, just doing routine patrol. They see a fish, hear a 
splash, and it fits their expectations perfectly.
They buy it completely.
 
CONTINUED ESCAPE
The patrol boat continues rowing, moving away from your position. The 
soldiers are chatting now, relaxed, attention elsewhere.
You signal the group: Stay low, move slowly, no more surface disturbance.
Elara, chastened by her near-discovery, controls her movements much more 
carefully now. The Cloak of Manta Ray makes swimming almost effortless for 
her-she just needs to stay calm.
The four of you continue underwater, moving northwest through the dark 
harbor waters.
Distance to extraction point: Approximately 150 more feet.
Stealth check (group, moving carefully now):
*	Johannes: 14 + 5 = 19
*	Kessa: 20 + 11 = 31 (nat 20 - exceptional)
*	Cyrus: 13 + 2 = 15
*	Elara: 12 + 0 = 12 (much better, learning fast)
Group total: 12 (adequate-no further complications)
 
REACHING THE EXTRACTION BOAT
After about 3 minutes of careful swimming, you see the dark shape of the 
small rowboat above-your extraction craft, waiting exactly where it was 
supposed to be.
You surface quietly near the stern. The two hooded rowers recognize you 
immediately.
"Mission successful?" one whispers.
You nod. "Get Elara aboard first."
They reach down, helping Elara climb into the boat. She's shaking-
adrenaline, cold, exhaustion, relief all hitting her at once. One of the rowers 
wraps her in a blanket.
Kessa climbs aboard next, then Cyrus, then you.
The moment you're all in the boat, the rowers begin pulling away from the 
harbor-steady, quiet strokes, heading toward open water where 
the Stormbreaker waits.
 
MISSION STATUS: PHASE 1 COMPLETE
Time: 12:42 AM 
Extraction: Successful 
Casualties:
*	Lucien (dead, body in Bag of Holding)
*	Guard (restrained, alive, will be found eventually)
*	No friendly casualties
Assets acquired:
*	Elara (rescued, safe, exhausted but unharmed)
*	Lucien's corpse (for intelligence exploitation)
*	Cloak of Displacement (magical item)
*	Ring of Protection (magical item)
*	Command insignia, maps, orders, journal (~800 gold in coin)
*	Strategic intelligence documents
Current status:
*	Rowing toward Stormbreaker (20 minutes to reach ship)
*	Dragon Army unaware of infiltration (Lucien's quarters appear empty, 
guard won't be found until shift change or someone checks on Lucien)
*	Storm attack can proceed as planned
 
ABOARD THE EXTRACTION BOAT
Elara is wrapped in the blanket, clutching her grandmother's locket, tears 
streaming down her face. "Is this real? Am I really free?"
Cyrus sits beside her, his voice gentle. "You're free. We're taking you to 
safety. Your mother will be so relieved."
Elara looks at the three of you-really looks, for the first time since the chaos 
of the extraction. "Who are you? I mean... I know you're resistance, 
but... you came for me. Just me. Why?"
Kessa answers simply: "Because you were a prisoner. Because your 
mother asked for help. Because it was the right thing to do."
"And because," you add, "the Dragon Army doesn't get to hold 
innocent people hostage. Not while we can do something about it."
Elara nods, fresh tears coming. "Thank you. All of you. I thought... I 
thought I'd be there until they had no more use for me. Or worse."
She pauses, then asks quietly: "Highlord Lucien. You said he was 
'gone.' Is he... did you kill him?"
 
How do you answer?
1.	Be direct: "Yes. He's dead. He won't hurt anyone else."
2.	Be vague: "He's not a threat anymore. That's all that matters."
3.	Defer: "Let's get you safe first. We can discuss everything later."
4.	Let Cyrus answer (as the cleric, he might frame it better)
5.	Something else?
The rowboat continues cutting through the dark water. The Stormbreaker is 
visible now-a dark shape against the slightly less dark sky, about 10 minutes 
away.
What do you say to Elara?
1
Dec 9
THE TRUTH
You meet Elara's eyes directly, your voice steady and honest.
"Yes. He's dead. He won't hurt anyone else."
Elara absorbs this for a long moment. Her expression cycles through shock, 
relief, guilt, and finally something like grim acceptance.
"Good," she says quietly. "Is that terrible? That I'm glad he's dead?"
Cyrus shakes his head gently. "No, child. He held you prisoner, used 
you as leverage against your mother, threatened your life. It's 
natural to feel relief that your captor is gone."
"He wasn't... directly cruel to me," Elara says, her voice distant. "Not 
physically. But he made it clear-every day-that my life depended 
on my mother's cooperation. That if she didn't provide what the 
Dragon Army needed, I would suffer for it. The threat was always 
there, hanging over everything."
She pulls the blanket tighter around herself. "He would come to my cabin 
sometimes. Just stand there, watching me. Reminding me that he 
controlled whether I lived or died. That was worse than any 
beating. The constant fear, the powerlessness..."
Kessa's expression hardens. "Men like that-men who use power over 
the helpless-they don't deserve mercy. You're free because he's 
dead. Don't feel guilty about that."
Elara nods slowly. "How did you...?" She trails off, then decides she doesn't 
need the details. "Never mind. I don't need to know. Just... thank you. 
For doing what had to be done."
 
REACHING THE STORMBREAKER
The rowboat pulls alongside the Stormbreaker. Captain Andra is at the rail, 
clearly relieved to see you.
"Commander! You're back. And you have her?" She sees Elara 
wrapped in the blanket. "By the gods, you actually pulled it off."
Rope ladders drop down. Sailors help Elara aboard first-she's weak and 
needs assistance, but she makes it. Kessa follows, then Cyrus, then you. The 
two rowers stay in their small boat, ready to return to shore.
"Payment," you say, handing one of the rowers a pouch of gold (50 gold 
pieces-generous for their risk). "Tell Maris the mission was a complete 
success. Elara is safe. Tell Lady Sharane her daughter will be 
coming home."
The rower nods, stowing the gold. "Safe sailing, Commander. Give the 
Dragon Army hell."
They row back toward Flotsam's lights, disappearing into the darkness.
 
ABOARD THE STORMBREAKER - 1:00 AM
Captain Andra directs sailors to help Elara below deck. "Get her warm, fed, 
and rested. Medical check if she needs it."
Elara looks back at you before she's led away. "Thank you. All of you. I'll 
never forget this."
Then she's gone, being cared for by the Stormbreaker's crew.
Andra turns to you, her expression serious. "Phase 1 complete. Now-
Phase 2. The fleet."
You glance toward Flotsam harbor-the lights, the dark shapes of fifteen 
Dragon Army warships at anchor. 3,000 soldiers sleeping aboard, unaware of 
what's coming.
Cyrus stands at the rail, the Tempest Scepter in his hands, staring at the 
distant fleet. His expression is resolute but heavy with the weight of what he's 
about to do.
"How long until we're in position?" you ask Captain Andra.
"We're already offshore about 4 miles," she says. "For the Scepter's 
range, we need to be within about 5-6 miles of the target. We can 
move to optimal position-say, 5 miles out-within 30 minutes. 
That puts us at 1:30 AM."
She pauses. "You want to hit them at 3 AM, you said? During the 
deepest part of the night watch, when most are asleep?"
You nod. "Maximum impact, minimum warning."
 
PREPARATION TIME: 1:00 AM - 3:00 AM
You have two hours before the storm attack.
What do you do during this time?
Immediate tasks:
1.	Distribute Lucien's loot (Cloak of Displacement, Ring of Protection, 
documents, maps, gold)
2.	Brief Captain Andra (tell her about Lucien's death, the intelligence 
gathered)
3.	Cyrus prepares mentally/spiritually (for calling the storm that will 
kill hundreds)
4.	Rest/recover (short rest if needed)
5.	Review storm targeting (ensure it hits the fleet, not the civilian city)
6.	Something else?
The Bag of Holding currently contains:
*	Lucien's corpse (for later intelligence exploitation at Haven)
*	Any other items stored there
Lucien's equipment to distribute:
*	Cloak of Displacement (Rare, requires attunement) - +disadvantage 
for attackers
*	Ring of Protection (Rare, requires attunement) - +1 AC and saves
*	Maps and orders (intelligence value)
*	Command insignia (could be useful for impersonation)
*	Journal (personal notes, possibly valuable intelligence)
*	~800 gold in various coin
Current party attunements:
*	Johannes: Ring of Mind Shielding, Amulet of Health, Trident of 
Warning
*	Kessa: Bracers of Defense, Rope of Entanglement, (one open slot)
*	Cyrus: Pearl of Power, Amulet of the Depths, Goggles of Night
Kessa has one open attunement slot. The Cloak of Displacement or Ring of 
Protection would be excellent for her.
 
What's your plan for the next two hours?
2 and 3
Dec 9
BRIEFING CAPTAIN ANDRA
You head to the captain's cabin with Kessa and Cyrus. Captain Andra pours 
four glasses of rum-a naval tradition after successful operations-and 
gestures for you to sit.
"Report, Commander. I saw you extract the girl successfully. What 
else happened aboard Tiamat's Wrath?"
You lay out the operation step by step:
"We infiltrated via the stern-Kessa through the discharge chute, 
Cyrus and I through the windows. Used alchemical gas to render 
Highlord Lucien unconscious in his quarters. Then we eliminated 
him."
Andra's eyebrows rise. "You killed a Dragon Army Highlord? While 
extracting the hostage?"
"Opportunity presented itself," Kessa says matter-of-factly. "He was 
alone, vulnerable, and his death removes a major threat. We took 
it."
"More than that," you continue, pulling out the Bag of Holding. "We have 
his body. And everything he was carrying."
You spread Lucien's possessions on the table:
*	Maps showing fleet deployment and coastal invasion targets
*	Sealed orders with Dragon Army command seals
*	Personal journal with notes on strategy and command structure
*	Command insignia and keys
*	The magical items (Cloak of Displacement, Ring of Protection)
*	Coin purse with ~800 gold
Andra examines the maps carefully, her tactical mind immediately recognizing 
their value. "These are detailed invasion plans. Ak-Thyln is the 
primary target, but there are secondary objectives here-Kalaman, 
Tarsis, half a dozen coastal cities. This is... this is a comprehensive 
conquest strategy."
She looks up at you. "And you have his corpse? Why?"
Cyrus explains: "Intelligence exploitation. We can use Speak with 
Dead to interrogate him-extract information about Dragon Army 
command structure, prisoner locations, strategic weaknesses. 
Then potentially use the body for disinformation operations later."
"Also," you add, "when the storm hits and the fleet is destroyed, 
Lucien's body won't be found in the wreckage. The Dragon Army 
will assume he drowned, was lost at sea. No investigation, no 
suspicion of infiltration. Just another casualty of the storm."
Andra sits back, impressed despite herself. "Commander, that's... that's 
extraordinarily thorough. You didn't just complete the mission-
you turned it into a major intelligence coup and removed a key 
enemy commander in the process."
She raises her glass. "To professional excellence. And to Elara's 
freedom."
You all drink.
 
THE STORM DISCUSSION
The rum finished, the mood shifts. Andra's expression becomes more somber.
"Now-the storm. You're planning to use the Tempest Scepter to 
destroy the entire Dragon Army fleet. Fifteen warships, roughly 
3,000 personnel aboard."
Cyrus nods slowly, the weight already visible in his eyes. "Yes. At 3 AM, 
when most are sleeping. We'll call a massive storm-hurricane 
winds, lightning, torrential rain. Drive the ships onto rocks, shatter 
their hulls, break their masts. Make them completely 
unseaworthy."
"And the crews?" Andra asks directly.
"We're not trying to maximize casualties," you clarify. "The storm 
targets the ships themselves. Sailors will have the opportunity to 
abandon ship, swim to shore. The harbor is close-400 to 800 feet 
from most anchor positions. Strong swimmers, quick thinkers, 
lucky ones-they'll survive."
Cyrus adds quietly: "But many won't. Storm conditions are deadly. 
Drowning, debris, panic, exhaustion. We're estimating 800 to 
1,200 dead. Perhaps more."
Andra is silent for a moment, then nods grimly. "War is never clean, 
Commander. Those sailors serve an army of conquest. They're 
sailing to invade Ak-Thyln, to subjugate free cities, to bring tyranny 
to the coast. You're stopping that. The blood is on the Dragon 
Army's hands-they chose this path."
She looks at Cyrus specifically. "Brother, you're carrying a heavy 
burden tonight. But remember-every sailor who dies in that storm 
is a soldier who won't be landing on Ak-Thyln's beaches, burning 
homes, enslaving families. You're trading hundreds of enemy lives 
for thousands of innocent ones. That's not murder. That's war."
Cyrus nods slowly, but you can see it doesn't make the weight any lighter.
 
CYRUS'S PREPARATION - SPIRITUAL 
READINESS
After the briefing, Cyrus excuses himself. "I need time alone. To pray. To 
prepare."
You find him an hour later on the forward deck, sitting cross-legged with the 
Tempest Scepter across his lap. The artifact pulses with faint blue-white light, 
responding to his presence.
He's not praying audibly-just sitting in silence, eyes closed, one hand on the 
Scepter, the other on his holy symbol of Mishakal.
You approach quietly. "Brother. How are you holding up?"
Cyrus opens his eyes. They're clear but sad. "I'm ready. Or as ready as I'll 
ever be."
He looks at the Scepter. "I've been communing with the divine-both 
Mishakal and Zeboim. Asking for wisdom, for strength, for 
forgiveness if what I'm about to do is wrong."
"And?" you ask gently.
"Mishakal reminds me that healing sometimes requires cutting 
away disease. That protecting the innocent sometimes means 
standing against those who threaten them-even unto death. She 
doesn't rejoice in violence, but she understands necessity."
He pauses. "Zeboim... Zeboim approves. She sees this as righteous-
using her storms to destroy tools of conquest, to test the strength of 
those caught in the tempest. She values freedom above all else. The 
Dragon Army sails to enslave-that's anathema to her."
Cyrus looks up at you. "I'm not at peace with what I'm about to do, 
Johannes. I won't be. I'll carry the weight of every soul that drowns 
tonight. But I accept the burden because the alternative-allowing 
that fleet to sail, to invade, to conquer-is worse."
He stands, gripping the Scepter firmly. "I will call the storm. I will 
shatter those ships. I will give the sailors every chance I can to 
survive-but I won't hold back the power needed to ensure the fleet 
is destroyed. And when it's done, I will pray for every soul lost, 
enemy and innocent alike."
"Then I'll mourn with you," you say. "And I'll help you carry that 
weight. You're not alone in this, Brother."
Cyrus clasps your shoulder. "Thank you, my friend. Now-let's finish 
this."
 
POSITIONING THE STORMBREAKER - 2:30 AM
Captain Andra has been slowly moving the Stormbreaker into optimal 
position. You're now approximately 5 miles offshore from Flotsam harbor-
far enough to be safe from the storm's effects, close enough for the Scepter's 
magic to reach.
From the deck, you can see Flotsam's lights in the distance-the city still 
sleeping, unaware of what's coming. The fifteen Dragon Army warships are 
dark shapes in the harbor, lanterns marking their positions. Occasional patrol 
boats move between them, small lights bobbing on the black water.
It's 2:45 AM.
Andra approaches. "We're in position, Commander. Stable 
anchorage, good visibility of the target zone. Whenever Brother 
Cyrus is ready."
The crew has been briefed-they know a storm is coming, they know it's 
magical, they know to stay well clear of the affected area. Some are nervous. 
Others are grimly satisfied-many of these sailors lost friends or family to 
Dragon Army raids.
 
FINAL PREPARATIONS - 2:45 AM TO 3:00 AM
You have fifteen minutes before the planned strike time.
Cyrus stands at the bow, the Tempest Scepter held in both hands. The 
artifact is glowing more brightly now-responding to his intent, to the divine 
power flowing through him, to Zeboim's blessing.
Kessa stands nearby, watching Flotsam. Her expression is unreadable-
professional, focused, but there's something in her eyes. Regret? Acceptance? 
Both?
You stand with them, looking at the distant fleet. In fifteen minutes, those 
ships will be wreckage. In an hour, hundreds will be dead.
It's a terrible calculus. But it's the right one.
 
Do you:
1.	Stand in silence (let these final minutes pass in quiet reflection)
2.	Say something to Cyrus (final words of support before he calls the 
storm)
3.	Say something to Kessa (check in on your companion)
4.	Pray yourself (to whatever gods might listen)
5.	Something else?
The minutes tick by. The sea is calm. The night is quiet.
Soon, it will be neither.
Wait
Dec 9
I'm pausing. What's on your mind?
No. I wait until Cyrus Acts
Dec 9
THE WAIT - 2:45 AM TO 3:00 AM
You stand in silence at the bow with Cyrus and Kessa, watching the distant 
lights of Flotsam. The sea is calm, the wind gentle. The Stormbreaker rocks 
softly at anchor.
Cyrus holds the Tempest Scepter, eyes closed, breathing steadily. Preparing 
himself mentally and spiritually for what comes next.
Kessa stands with arms crossed, her professional mask firmly in place, but you 
can see the tension in her shoulders. She's killed many people-but never 
hundreds at once, never from a distance like this.
You simply wait. There's nothing more to say. The decision is made. The time 
approaches.
2:50 AM. Ten minutes.
2:55 AM. Five minutes.
Captain Andra quietly orders her crew to secure anything loose on deck. The 
sailors move efficiently, professionally. They trust their captain. They trust 
you.
2:58 AM. Two minutes.
Cyrus opens his eyes. He looks at the Scepter in his hands, then at the distant 
harbor, then at you.
"It's time," he says quietly.
You nod.
 
CYRUS CALLS THE STORM - 3:00 AM
Cyrus raises the Tempest Scepter high, pointing it toward Flotsam harbor. He 
speaks-not loudly, but with absolute conviction:
"Zeboim, Lady of Storms, Mistress of the Deeps-I invoke your 
power. Grant me your tempest. Let the winds howl. Let the 
lightning strike. Let the sea rise against those who would enslave 
the free peoples of Ansalon."
"Shatter the ships of tyranny. Give their sailors the same choice 
you give all who face your storms-survive through strength, or 
perish in the deep. Let this be righteous fury, not mindless 
slaughter. Let this be your will made manifest."
He brings the Scepter down in a sharp arc, pointing directly at the distant 
fleet.
"STORM'S FURY!"
 
THE STORM BEGINS
The Tempest Scepter blazes with blinding blue-white light. Lightning arcs 
from its tip, shooting across five miles of open water toward Flotsam harbor. 
The bolt doesn't strike the ships directly-instead, it explodes in the sky above 
the fleet, spreading like a web of electrical fury across the entire harbor.
Then the storm begins.
 
WIND
The wind hits first-not gradually building, but instantly. Zero to hurricane 
force in seconds. The calm night air becomes a screaming gale, 100+ mph 
winds hammering Flotsam harbor from every direction simultaneously.
The Dragon Army warships, peacefully at anchor moments before, are 
suddenly battered by impossible winds. Masts creak, then groan, then begin to 
snap. Sails that were furled tear loose and shred instantly. Anchor chains 
strain against the sudden force.
Men on deck watch are blown off their feet, some swept overboard 
immediately. Lanterns extinguish or crash, spreading fire. Alarm bells begin 
ringing-chaotic, panicked.
 
RAIN
The rain comes next-not drops, but sheets. Torrential, blinding, impossible 
amounts of water falling from the sky. Visibility drops to near zero. The harbor 
becomes a churning mess of wind-driven rain and spray.
Below decks, sleeping sailors wake to the sound of apocalyptic weather. Water 
begins pouring through any opening-hatches, gun ports, damaged sections. 
The ships are being drenched, weighted down, pushed and pulled by forces 
beyond anything natural.
 
LIGHTNING
Then the lightning. Bolt after bolt, striking masts, rails, water. The harbor is 
illuminated in strobing flashes-blue-white light revealing scenes of chaos and 
terror. Sailors scrambling on deck, trying to secure lines or abandon ship. 
Officers shouting orders that can't be heard over the wind.
One lightning bolt strikes the main mast of a warship-you can see it even 
from five miles away-and the entire mast explodes in splinters, crashing 
down onto the deck below, crushing anyone underneath.
 
THE SEA RISES
And finally, the sea itself responds to Zeboim's fury. Waves that should not 
exist in a harbor-ten feet, fifteen feet, twenty feet high-crash into the 
anchored ships. The vessels are driven against each other, hulls grinding, 
smashing, splintering.
Ships begin to drag anchor, pushed by wind and wave toward the shore, 
toward rocks, toward the docks. Some collide with each other-massive 
wooden hulls crashing together with the sound of thunder.
The first ship to founder is one of the smaller warships on the eastern edge of 
the fleet. A wave catches it broadside, the wind catches the broken rigging, and 
it simply capsizes. One moment it's struggling to stay upright, the next it's 
rolling over, men screaming as they're thrown into the churning water.
 
THE HARBOR IN CHAOS
From your position five miles away on the Stormbreaker, you can see the 
storm's terrible majesty. A circular area roughly one mile in diameter, 
centered on the Dragon Army fleet, is being subjected to the full fury of a 
hurricane compressed into a single hour.
Lightning flashes constantly. 
Wind screams. 
Rain blinds. 
Waves smash.
Ships are being driven onto the docks, onto rocks, onto each other. You see 
masts falling, hulls breaking, sails tearing. Men jumping into the water, trying 
to swim for shore through impossible conditions.
The Stormbreaker itself is affected peripherally-the wind is strong 
here, the waves higher than normal, rain beginning to fall-but nothing like 
the apocalyptic conditions in the harbor. Captain Andra has already ordered 
all hands to secure positions, and the ship rides the rough water confidently.
 
CYRUS WATCHES
The cleric stands at the bow, the Tempest Scepter still glowing in his hands, 
channeling divine power into the storm. His face is wet-rain or tears, you 
can't tell. His lips move in prayer, though you can't hear the words over the 
wind.
He's maintaining the storm, guiding it, ensuring it focuses on the ships rather 
than spreading to devastate the entire city. This is controlled fury, not blind 
destruction.
But it's still fury. And it's still killing people.
 
THE FLEET'S DESTRUCTION - FIRST 15 
MINUTES
3:00-3:15 AM:
Five ships have already capsized or broken apart completely. Their 
crews are in the water-some swimming desperately for shore (400-800 feet 
through storm conditions), some clinging to wreckage, some simply 
disappearing beneath the waves.
Three more ships have been driven onto rocks or the docks, their 
hulls shattered, taking on water rapidly. Men pour from below decks, 
abandoning ship in organized or panicked fashion depending on their officers.
The remaining seven ships are still afloat but heavily damaged-
masts broken, sails destroyed, hulls leaking, listing badly. They're being 
pushed inexorably toward shore or rocks by the wind and waves.
You can see patrol boats capsizing-the small craft have no chance in these 
conditions. The men aboard are thrown into the maelstrom.
On shore, Flotsam itself is in chaos. The city has woken to the sound of the 
storm. People pour into the streets, staring at the harbor in horror. Some 
brave souls (or foolish ones) are running toward the docks, trying to help 
sailors who make it to shore.
The Dragon Army garrison is mobilizing-you can see torches and 
lanterns moving in organized groups. But what can they do? Fight a storm? 
They're helpless, watching their fleet die.
 
KESSA SPEAKS
Over the wind, Kessa shouts: "It's working! The fleet is being 
destroyed!"
But her voice lacks triumph. She's watching men die, and even for a 
professional killer, this is different. This is wholesale destruction.
 
Do you:
1.	Continue watching in silence (bear witness to what you've 
unleashed)
2.	Check on Cyrus (see how he's holding up under the burden)
3.	Say something to Kessa (acknowledge the weight of this moment)
4.	Go below deck (you don't need to watch this)
5.	Something else?
The storm continues. The screaming wind. The crashing waves. The dying 
fleet.
Time remaining: 45 minutes of Storm's Fury.

Dec 9
CHECKING ON CYRUS
You move closer to Cyrus, fighting against the wind that's reached even 
the Stormbreaker. The cleric stands rigid at the bow, both hands gripping the 
Tempest Scepter, his entire body trembling with the effort of channeling 
divine power.
"Cyrus," you call over the wind. "Brother, are you alright?"
He doesn't respond immediately. His eyes are fixed on the harbor, on the 
destruction, on the flashes of lightning revealing scenes of chaos and death. 
Tears are streaming down his face, mixing with the rain and spray.
"I can feel them," he says hoarsely. "Every life that ends. Every soul 
that passes. Mishakal grants me awareness-not specifics, just... 
the weight. The numbers."
His grip tightens on the Scepter. "Seventy-three so far. Seventy-three 
men have drowned or been crushed. Most of them never woke up-
trapped below deck when their ships capsized. They died in their 
sleep, drowned in the dark."
He closes his eyes briefly. "Is that mercy or cruelty? That they never 
knew what killed them?"
 
THE STORM CONTINUES
Another massive wave crashes into a warship, and even from five miles away 
you can hear the terrible sound of wood splintering. The ship's hull cracks 
open, and it begins to sink rapidly.
Men pour from the hatches-some making it into the water, some trapped as 
the ship goes down.
Cyrus's body jerks slightly. "Eighty-one. Eighty-nine. Ninety-four."
He's counting. He's feeling each death as it happens.
"Cyrus, you don't have to-" you start, but he shakes his head.
"Yes, I do. If I'm going to kill them, I will WITNESS them. Every 
single one. I will know what this costs. I will carry their weight."
His voice cracks. "One hundred and twelve. One hundred and twenty-
three."
 
SURVIVORS REACHING SHORE
But it's not all death. Through the storm, you can see figures making it to 
shore-sailors who abandoned ship early, strong swimmers, lucky ones who 
found wreckage to cling to. They crawl onto the docks or the beach, collapsing, 
coughing up water, alive.
"Some are surviving," you point out. "Look-there, and there. 
They're making it."
Cyrus nods, his expression desperate for any comfort. "Yes. Yes, I can feel 
that too. Perhaps... perhaps three hundred have reached shore 
already. Maybe more. They're exhausted, injured, but alive."
Another ship breaks apart, its back snapping under the combined force of 
wind and wave.
"One hundred and forty-seven. One hundred and fifty-nine."
 
THE BURDEN OF DIVINE AWARENESS
You realize what's happening. Cyrus isn't just wielding Zeboim's power-he's 
experiencing it through Mishakal's lens. The storm goddess grants 
destruction; the healing goddess grants awareness. He's caught between two 
divine perspectives: the righteous fury and the tragic cost.
"Cyrus," you say firmly, gripping his shoulder. "You're not alone in this. 
I ordered this strike. I made this decision. The weight is mine as 
much as yours."
"No," Cyrus says, his voice strained but resolute. "You made the strategic 
decision. I'm executing it. I'm the one channeling the power that's 
killing them. This is MY burden to carry. And I accept it. I just... I 
need to feel it. To honor it. To remember."
He looks at you, rain and tears streaming down his face. "Promise me 
something, Johannes. Promise me that when we return to Haven, 
we'll tell Laurana exactly what this cost. Not just 'we destroyed the 
fleet.' The real number. Every life. So they know what was paid to 
stop this invasion."
"I promise," you say immediately.
"And promise me," he continues, his voice breaking, "that we'll do 
everything in our power to make sure those 3,000 deaths meant 
something. That they saved thousands more. That this wasn't just... 
senseless slaughter."
"I promise, Brother. On my honor. Their deaths will matter."
 
THE TURNING POINT - 3:30 AM
By now, the harbor is a scene of utter devastation:
Twelve of fifteen ships are completely destroyed-capsized, broken, or 
sunk. The water is choked with debris, wreckage, bodies.
The remaining three ships are clearly doomed-they're being driven 
inexorably toward the rocky shore, hulls breached, taking on massive amounts 
of water. Their crews are abandoning ship en masse, jumping into the storm-
tossed water and swimming desperately for land.
The shore is lined with survivors-hundreds of soaked, exhausted 
Dragon Army sailors who made it. Flotsam citizens are helping pull them from 
the water, despite the Dragon Army being an occupying force. Common 
humanity overrides politics in the face of disaster.
The Dragon Army garrison has given up trying to organize a military 
response and is instead focused on rescue-boats going out (carefully, in the 
edges of the storm), ropes being thrown, medics treating the survivors.
Cyrus's counting has become almost mechanical: "Four hundred and 
eighteen. Four hundred and thirty-two. Four hundred and fifty-
six."
But he also adds, desperately: "Eight hundred on shore. Maybe nine 
hundred. Nearly half have survived."
 
THE STORM'S END - 3:45 AM
As the storm approaches its one-hour duration, Cyrus speaks one final prayer:
"Mishakal, goddess of healing, receive these souls. They were 
soldiers of tyranny, but they were also sons, brothers, fathers. 
Grant them peace."
"Zeboim, Lady of Storms, your fury has been righteous. The fleet is 
broken. Let your waters now be still."
The Tempest Scepter's glow begins to fade. The storm doesn't stop instantly-
that would be unnatural-but it begins to diminish rapidly. The wind drops 
from hurricane force to merely strong. The rain lessens. The waves calm.
By 4:00 AM, the storm is gone. The harbor is eerily quiet except for the sounds 
of wreckage settling, survivors calling out, and rescue efforts continuing.
 
THE AFTERMATH
Dawn is still hours away, but the damage is clear:
The Dragon Army fleet: Completely destroyed. All fifteen warships are 
wrecked beyond any possibility of repair. Twelve are sunk or capsized. Three 
are beached and broken.
Casualties (Cyrus's final count):
*	Dead: 547 sailors and marines
*	Survived: Approximately 2,450
*	Missing/uncertain: Small number, likely drowned but not 
confirmed
The invasion of Ak-Thyln is impossible. The Dragon Army has lost its entire 
naval capability in this region. Thousands of soldiers are stranded in Flotsam 
with no ships, no equipment, and no way to continue their mission.
 
CYRUS COLLAPSES
The moment the storm fully ends and the Scepter's glow extinguishes 
completely, Cyrus's legs give out. You catch him before he hits the deck.
He's not unconscious-just utterly spent. Physically, mentally, spiritually 
exhausted.
"Five hundred and forty-seven," he whispers. "I felt every one. Every 
single one."
Then he looks up at you, his eyes red and haunted but also... resolved.
"But we saved Ak-Thyln. We saved the coastal cities. We stopped 
the invasion. It was worth it. It had to be worth it."
He's not asking for confirmation. He's telling himself. Trying to believe it.
"It was worth it, Brother," you say firmly. "And their sacrifice will be 
remembered."
Kessa appears, helping you support Cyrus. "Let's get him below. He needs 
rest."
Captain Andra approaches, her expression grim but 
respectful. "Commander, the mission is complete. The Dragon Army 
fleet is destroyed. Do you want to remain here, or shall we set 
course for Haven?"
 
What do you do?
1.	Depart immediately for Haven (before Dragon Army organizes, 
while chaos still reigns)
2.	Remain offshore briefly (observe the aftermath, gather any final 
intelligence)
3.	Send a message to Flotsam (to Lady Sharane, to "The Fishwife," 
confirming Elara is safe)
4.	Something else?
The mission is complete. The fleet is destroyed. Elara is safe. Lucien is dead.
But the cost weighs heavy on all of you.
1
Dec 9
DEPARTURE FOR HAVEN - 4:15 AM
"Set course for Haven immediately," you order Captain Andra. "Best 
possible speed. We need to be far from here before the Dragon 
Army sorts itself out."
Andra nods crisply. "Aye, Commander. We'll be underway within 
minutes."
She turns to her crew, barking orders. "Weigh anchor! Unfurl all sails! 
Helmsman, set course southwest by south-Haven, maximum 
speed! Move!"
The Stormbreaker comes alive with purposeful activity. Sailors scramble up 
the rigging, canvas drops and catches the wind, the anchor chain rattles up. 
Within five minutes, the ship is cutting through the water, putting distance 
between you and Flotsam.
 
BELOW DECK - CYRUS'S CABIN
You and Kessa help Cyrus below. He can walk, but barely-his legs are 
unsteady, his entire body trembling with exhaustion. You ease him onto his 
bunk.
"Rest, Brother," you say quietly. "You've done what needed to be 
done. Sleep now."
Cyrus nods weakly. "Five hundred and forty-seven," he murmurs 
again. "I need to remember the number. For the report. For 
Laurana. For... for myself."
His eyes are already closing. The combination of magical exertion, spiritual 
burden, and emotional exhaustion has drained him completely.
Within moments, he's asleep-not peaceful sleep, but the deep, dreamless 
sleep of someone pushed past their limits.
Kessa pulls a blanket over him. "He's going to carry this for the rest of 
his life," she says quietly.
"We all will," you reply. "But he carried the heaviest part. He felt 
every death."
"That's... that's a terrible gift," Kessa says. "To be aware like that. I 
kill people, but I don't FEEL it the way he did. I don't know if I 
could."
You look at the Tempest Scepter, now resting beside Cyrus's bunk, its glow 
completely extinguished. It looks like an ordinary staff now-no hint of the 
devastating power it just unleashed.
"Come on," you say. "Let's check on Elara, then get some rest 
ourselves. It's been a long night."
 
ELARA'S CABIN
You find Elara in a small passenger cabin, wrapped in blankets, a bowl of soup 
(mostly eaten) on the table beside her. She's awake, staring at the ceiling.
"Elara," you say gently, knocking on the open door. "How are you 
feeling?"
She sits up slowly. "Better. Warmer. Fed. Safe, for the first time in 
two weeks." She pauses. "I heard... something. Earlier. Like thunder, 
but sustained. And the ship was rocking more than normal. What 
happened?"
You exchange glances with Kessa. How much to tell her?
"The Dragon Army fleet," you say simply. "It no longer exists. A 
storm destroyed it."
Elara's eyes widen. "All of it? All fifteen ships?"
"All of it."
She processes this for a long moment. "And the sailors? The soldiers?"
"Many survived," Kessa says. "Maybe half. The rest..." She doesn't 
finish.
Elara closes her eyes. "So many deaths. Because of me."
"No," you say firmly. "Not because of you. Because the Dragon Army 
chose conquest. Because they held you hostage. Because they were 
sailing to invade and enslave thousands. What happened tonight 
saved far more lives than it cost."
"But it still cost lives," Elara whispers.
"Yes. And we'll carry that weight. But it was the right choice."
Elara nods slowly, not fully convinced but accepting it. "When will we 
reach Haven?"
"Three days, maybe four," Kessa estimates. "Depending on wind and 
weather. You'll be reunited with your mother soon."
Elara's expression softens at that. "I can't wait to see her. To hold her. 
To tell her I'm safe." She touches the silver locket at her neck. "Thank 
you. For everything. For saving me. For... for doing what you had to 
do."
"Rest," you tell her. "You're safe now. That's all that matters."
 
ON DECK - DAWN APPROACHES
You return to the deck as the first hints of dawn touch the eastern horizon. 
The Stormbreaker is making excellent speed, already 15-20 miles from 
Flotsam. Behind you, the sky above the city is still dark with residual storm 
clouds, slowly dissipating.
Captain Andra joins you at the rail. "We're clear, Commander. No 
pursuit-the Dragon Army has no ships left to pursue with. We're 
safe."
You nod, watching the sunrise.
"One hell of a night," Andra says quietly. "I've seen naval battles 
before. Fought in a few. But I've never seen anything like what 
Brother Cyrus did. That was... gods, that was divine wrath made 
manifest."
"He paid for it," you say. "In a way I don't think any of us can fully 
understand."
"But it worked," Andra says pragmatically. "The Dragon Army's 
invasion capability in this region is gone. Ak-Thyln is safe. The 
coastal cities are safe. And we have a Dragon Army Highlord's 
corpse, his intelligence, and a rescued hostage. By any measure, 
this operation was a complete success."
She's right. Tactically, strategically-it was a perfect operation.
But it doesn't feel like victory. It feels like necessity. Like survival. Like the 
grim reality of war.
 
THE VOYAGE HOME
The sun rises fully, illuminating the Stormbreaker as it sails southwest toward 
Haven. The sea is calm now, almost peaceful. Hard to believe that just hours 
ago, a divine storm was tearing ships apart.
Mission status:
*	Elara: Rescued, safe, recovering
*	Lucien: Dead, body and intelligence secured
*	Dragon Army fleet: Completely destroyed (15/15 ships wrecked)
*	Casualties: 547 dead, ~2,450 survived but stranded
*	Invasion: Prevented-Ak-Thyln and coastal cities saved
Party status:
*	Johannes: Exhausted but unharmed
*	Kessa: Weary, contemplative
*	Cyrus: Physically and spiritually drained, sleeping, will need time to 
recover
Assets acquired:
*	Cloak of Displacement (magical)
*	Ring of Protection (magical)
*	Lucien's strategic documents and maps
*	Command insignia and journal
*	~800 gold
*	Invaluable intelligence for Haven
 
THREE DAYS LATER - APPROACHING HAVEN
The voyage is uneventful. The Stormbreaker makes good time, the weather 
favors you, and no Dragon Army assets intercept (how could they?).
Cyrus gradually recovers. He emerges from his cabin after the first day, 
moving slowly, looking haunted but functional. He spends hours in prayer, 
speaking to both Mishakal and Zeboim, seeking peace with what he did. The 
number "five hundred and forty-seven" is burned into his memory-he 
mentions it often.
Elara grows stronger. With food, rest, and safety, she begins to look more 
like herself. She spends time on deck, watching the sea, clutching her 
grandmother's locket. She asks about her mother constantly-How is she? 
Does she know I'm safe? When will I see her?
Kessa remains steady. The professional mask never fully comes down, but 
you catch her staring at the horizon sometimes, lost in thought. She killed 
Lucien personally, witnessed the storm's destruction-even for someone 
trained to kill, this operation was intense.
You process everything. The decisions made, the lives saved, the lives lost. 
The weight of command. The reality that you ordered an attack that killed 547 
people-even if it saved thousands more.
On the third evening, as Haven comes into view on the horizon, Cyrus joins 
you at the rail.
"I've been thinking," he says quietly. "About Lucien's corpse. About 
the interrogation we can conduct with Speak with Dead."
"And?"
"I don't think I should be the one to question him," Cyrus admits. "I 
killed 547 of his men. I'm... not objective. Laurana should handle it, 
or someone from intelligence. Someone who can ask the right 
questions without emotion clouding judgment."
"Agreed," you say. "We bring the corpse to Laurana, along with all 
the documents and intelligence. Let Haven's professionals extract 
everything useful. That's not our role."
Cyrus nods with visible relief. "Good. I've done enough this week."
 
ARRIVAL AT HAVEN - EVENING, DAY 4
The Stormbreaker enters Haven's hidden dock as the sun sets. Word has 
already spread-scouts spotted you approaching, runners were sent ahead.
Commander Laurana Brightblade is waiting at the dock, along with a 
small group of officers and healers.
As you disembark, Laurana's eyes scan your group quickly: You, looking 
weary but intact. Kessa, professional as always. Cyrus, moving 
slowly, looking like he's aged ten years. And Elara, wrapped in a 
cloak, nervous but whole.
"Commander Constantinius," Laurana says formally. "Report."
"Mission successful, Commander," you reply. "Elara has been 
extracted and is unharmed. The Dragon Army fleet at Flotsam has 
been completely destroyed-all fifteen warships rendered 
unseaworthy. The invasion of Ak-Thyln has been prevented. 
Additionally, we eliminated Highlord Lucien and secured his body 
along with extensive intelligence materials."
Laurana's eyes widen slightly-the only visible sign of her surprise. "You... 
all of that? In one operation?"
"Yes, ma'am."
She looks at your group with something like awe. "That's... extraordinary. 
Come. We'll debrief fully, but first-" She gestures to the healers. "Get 
medical attention, food, rest. You've earned it."
Then she approaches Elara directly, her voice softening. "Lady Elara. Your 
mother has been beside herself with worry. She's in Haven, 
waiting. Would you like to see her?"
Elara's face transforms-hope, joy, tears. "Yes. Please. I need to see her."
Laurana smiles genuinely. "Come with me."
As Elara is led away toward an emotional reunion, Laurana turns back to 
you. "We'll debrief tomorrow morning. For now-rest. You've done 
exceptional work."
She pauses, then adds quietly: "And I'm sorry for whatever it cost you."
 
EPILOGUE - THE NEXT MORNING
The formal debriefing takes place in Haven's command center. You, Kessa, 
and Cyrus present the full operational report:
*	Infiltration of Tiamat's Wrath
*	Assassination of Highlord Lucien
*	Extraction of Elara
*	Destruction of the Dragon Army fleet via Tempest Scepter
*	Casualty estimates: 547 enemy dead, ~2,450 survived but stranded
Laurana listens carefully, taking notes, asking clarifying questions. When you 
present Lucien's corpse (still in the Bag of Holding), his equipment, and the 
intelligence documents, her tactical staff practically vibrates with excitement.
"This is a intelligence goldmine," one officer says, examining the 
maps. "Fleet dispositions, invasion timelines, command structure-
we can use this."
When Cyrus reports the casualty numbers-specifically that he was divinely 
aware of each death-Laurana's expression becomes somber.
"Brother Cyrus," she says gently. "What you did saved thousands of 
lives. Ak-Thyln, Kalaman, Tarsis-all those cities that would have 
fallen to Dragon Army invasion. The coastal peoples owe you a debt 
they'll never know they have."
"Five hundred and forty-seven," Cyrus says quietly. "That's the price."
"Yes," Laurana acknowledges. "And it's a price we'll honor. Every 
report, every record will include that number. We won't forget 
what it cost."
 
REWARDS AND RECOGNITION
Tactical Assessment: The operation is declared a complete strategic 
success. The Dragon Army's naval capability in the region is eliminated, a 
major invasion prevented, a Highlord killed, and invaluable intelligence 
acquired.
Commendations: All three of you receive formal recognition from Haven's 
resistance command.
Tempest Scepter: Cyrus confirms he will return the Scepter to Zeboim's 
domain once an appropriate sacred site is identified, as promised.
Lucien's Equipment:
*	Cloak of Displacement: Available for party use (Kessa could attune, 
or keep for future need)
*	Ring of Protection: Available for party use
*	Gold and valuables: ~800 gp split three ways (~265 gp each)
*	Intelligence materials: Turned over to Haven command
Character Development:
*	Johannes: Demonstrated exceptional tactical leadership and moral 
clarity under pressure
*	Kessa: Proved invaluable as infiltration specialist and team anchor
*	Cyrus: Bore an immense spiritual burden and maintained his 
principles despite the cost
 
ELARA AND LADY SHARANE
Later that day, Elara and her mother visit you privately. Lady Sharane-a 
wealthy merchant in her fifties, elegant despite obvious stress-embraces you 
with tears in her eyes.
"You brought my daughter home," she says, her voice breaking. "I don't 
have words. I don't have enough gold. I could never repay what 
you've done."
"We don't need repayment," you say simply. "Your daughter is free. 
That's enough."
Elara adds quietly: "They killed the man who held me captive. They 
destroyed the fleet that would have enslaved thousands. And they 
gave me a chance to live again. I'll never forget that."
Lady Sharane insists on providing a substantial reward: 2,000 gold 
pieces (split three ways: ~665 gp each), plus a standing offer of merchant 
contacts, intelligence network access, and future support.
 
PERSONAL FUNDS UPDATE
Johannes:
*	Previous: ~3,050 gp
*	Lucien's share: +265 gp
*	Sharane's reward: +665 gp
*	New total: ~3,980 gp
 
MISSION COMPLETE
The Flotsam operation is over. The Dragon Army invasion is stopped. Elara is 
home. Lucien is dead. The fleet is destroyed.
But the war continues. And you've proven-once again-that even against 
overwhelming odds, freedom can triumph.
Cyrus stands at Haven's small temple, praying for the souls of five 
hundred and forty-seven enemy soldiers he killed to save 
thousands of innocents.
Kessa sharpens her blades, already thinking about the next 
mission.
And you stand looking at the map of Ansalon, knowing that 
somewhere out there, the Dragon Army is regrouping, planning, 
preparing their next move.
The fight goes on.
 
End of Session
Would you like to:
1.	Take a break/end here
2.	Continue with downtime activities at Haven
3.	Move to the next mission
4.	Something else?
Ooc - I absolutely love where this is all going. That said, ID like two things: we 
need a fun adventure, like a competition or game, something a little lighter. 
And 2) Is like some kind of redemption arc for Cyrus. That storyline? Chef's 
kiss. But i can't let it stay there. It's too much. I can't let Cyrus stay there, in 
that head/heart space.
Dec 9
OOC - Direction Discussion
I'm so glad you're enjoying it! And I completely understand both requests. Let 
me address them:
 
1. Fun, Lighter Adventure
Absolutely yes. We've been doing heavy, dark, morally complex missions for a 
while now. The party needs (and deserves) something lighter-a palate 
cleanser that's still engaging but doesn't carry the weight of hundreds of 
deaths and moral calculus.
Some ideas for lighter adventures:
*	Tournament/Competition Arc: Haven hosts games/contests 
(archery, magical duels, tactical challenges). Friendly rivalry, showcase 
skills, win prizes, meet interesting NPCs, no life-or-death stakes.
*	Festival/Celebration: A liberated town throws a festival. The party 
participates in festivities, solves a minor mystery (stolen prize pig?), 
helps with entertainment, maybe light combat against bandits trying to 
ruin things.
*	Treasure Hunt: Old map found, leads to forgotten cache. Classic 
dungeon delve with traps, puzzles, monsters-but no moral weight, just 
adventure for adventure's sake.
*	Diplomatic Mission Gone Silly: Escort duty or negotiation that goes 
comedically sideways. No betrayals or darkness, just chaos and 
problem-solving.
*	Help a Village: Small-scale problem (monster in the woods, cursed 
well, rivalry between families) that's important to locals but low-stakes 
for the party.
Which appeals to you? Or something else entirely?
 
2. Cyrus's Redemption Arc
You're absolutely right. Cyrus is in a dark, heavy place right now-carrying 547 
deaths on his conscience, questioning whether he's still worthy of Mishakal's 
grace, wondering if he's crossed a line he can't uncross.
That cannot be where his story stays.
Here's what I'm thinking for his redemption arc:
The Setup: Cyrus has saved thousands by killing hundreds. He did the right 
thing strategically, but it's tearing him apart spiritually. He needs to 
be shown-not just told-that his actions had meaning, that he's still worthy, 
that he can still heal and help.
Potential Redemption Path Ideas:
Option A: "The Lives You Saved"
*	Cyrus meets survivors from Ak-Thyln (the city that would have been 
invaded)
*	Families, children, elderly-people who are alive because the fleet never 
came
*	They don't know about the storm; they just know they're safe
*	Personal, tangible evidence that his sacrifice mattered
*	Maybe a child gives him a flower or drawing, completely innocent, 
unknowing
*	Emotional impact: "These people live because of what you did"
Option B: "Mishakal's Reassurance"
*	Divine vision or direct communication from Mishakal
*	She acknowledges his pain but affirms his righteousness
*	"You are still my servant. You are still worthy. Healing sometimes 
requires difficult choices."
*	Maybe she shows him an alternate timeline where he didn't call the 
storm-Ak-Thyln burning, thousands enslaved
*	Emotional impact: Divine validation that he's not damned
Option C: "The Unexpected Mercy"
*	Cyrus encounters one of the Dragon Army sailors who survived the 
storm
*	The sailor was a conscript, forced into service, grateful to be alive and 
free
*	Says something like "That storm saved me. I was going to desert but 
they'd have killed my family. Now I'm 'lost at sea' and I can go home."
*	Emotional impact: Not everyone who survived is angry; some were 
freed by the chaos
Option D: "The Greater Healing"
*	Cyrus performs a major act of healing that only he could do
*	Saves a life (or many lives) in a way that reaffirms his identity as healer 
first, warrior second
*	Maybe uses the same divine power that counted deaths to now count 
lives saved
*	Emotional impact: "You are still who you were. You can still heal."
Option E: Combination/Something Else
*	Mix elements from above or create something entirely different
 
My Recommendation:
Short term (next session): Light adventure that gives the party (especially 
Cyrus) a break from heavy moral weight. Tournament, festival, treasure 
hunt-something fun.
Medium term (following session): Cyrus's redemption arc. My 
preference is Option A or C-something human-scale and tangible. Having 
Cyrus meet the people he saved (or a soldier he "freed") feels more grounded 
and powerful than divine reassurance.
Long term: Continue the main campaign plot (Dragon Army, Johannes's 
patron quest, etc.) but with conscious inclusion of lighter moments and 
character development.
 
What do you think?
1.	Which type of lighter adventure appeals most?
2.	Which redemption arc approach feels right for Cyrus?
3.	Any other elements you'd like to see?
I want to make sure this story stays enjoyable and doesn't become 
oppressively dark. Cyrus deserves healing, and the party deserves fun.
Don't give me the details; again, surprise me. I just wanted to express what I 
need.
Dec 9
OOC - Understood
Perfect. I hear you loud and clear:
1.	Next up: Something lighter and fun (competition/game/celebration 
vibe)
2.	Following that: Cyrus gets his redemption arc - he will find peace and 
healing
3.	Keep surprising you - no spoilers, let the story unfold naturally
I'll design both with care and make sure they feel earned and meaningful. 
Cyrus will be okay. And you'll all get to have some actual fun for once.
Ready to continue whenever you are! Should we start with some downtime at 
Haven, or jump ahead to the lighter adventure?
Just a clarification: lighter, but please not corny or seasonal. A really awesome, 
crunchy but not world at stake adventure.
Dec 9
OOC - Perfect Clarification
Got it:
*	Lighter = Lower emotional/moral stakes, not "save the world or 
everyone dies"
*	NOT corny/cheesy = No harvest festivals, baking contests, or "help 
find the mayor's lost cat"
*	NOT seasonal/contrived = Feels organic to the world, not a "filler 
episode"
*	Crunchy = Real challenges, tactical thinking, combat/problem-solving 
that matters
*	Awesome = Engaging plot, interesting NPCs, cool locations, rewarding 
gameplay
So basically: A legitimately compelling adventure that happens to not carry the 
weight of mass casualties or world-ending consequences. An adventure where 
the stakes are personal or local but still real.
I've got it. You'll get something that feels like a proper D&D adventure - 
dangerous, interesting, tactical - just without the crushing moral burden.
Ready when you are!
Ok. Let's go.
Dec 9
HAVEN - THREE DAYS AFTER DEBRIEFING
You've had time to rest, recover, and process the Flotsam operation. 
The Stormbreaker departed two days ago, Captain Andra taking her crew back 
to Ak-Thyln with news of the successful mission and thanks from Commander 
Laurana.
Elara and Lady Sharane left yesterday-returning to their estate with a 
resistance escort. Elara hugged each of you before leaving, her grandmother's 
locket gleaming at her throat. She's still processing everything, but she's alive 
and free.
Cyrus has been spending most of his time in Haven's small temple, praying 
extensively. He's functional-eating, sleeping, participating in daily life-but 
there's a heaviness to him that wasn't there before. He smiles less. He's 
quieter. The number "547" still haunts him.
Kessa has been keeping busy with training and equipment maintenance. She's 
attentive to Cyrus's state but doesn't push-she understands that some 
burdens take time.
You've been reviewing the intelligence from Lucien's documents, meeting with 
Laurana's staff, and managing the aftermath of the operation. The strategic 
impact is enormous-the Dragon Army's regional naval capability is gone, 
their invasion timeline disrupted, their command structure scrambled by 
Lucien's death.
 
UNEXPECTED VISITOR
It's mid-afternoon when a runner finds you in Haven's common 
area. "Commander Constantinius? There's a dwarf at the main gate 
asking for you specifically. Says his name is Thordin Ironhelm. 
Says you'll want to hear what he has to say."
The name doesn't ring any bells. You've met dwarves before, but no one 
named Thordin.
"Did he say what he wants?"
"No, sir. Just that it's 'a matter of professional interest to skilled 
operatives.' Those were his exact words."
Curious. You gather Kessa and Cyrus and head to the gate.
 
THORDIN IRONHELM
The dwarf waiting at Haven's entrance is impressive even by dwarven 
standards.
Thordin Ironhelm stands about 4'8", built like a brick wall, with a 
magnificent braided beard shot through with silver. He wears well-made 
traveling clothes, carries a warhammer at his belt, and has the bearing of 
someone who's seen serious action. His eyes are sharp, intelligent, assessing.
When he sees you approach, he nods respectfully. "Commander 
Constantinius? Kessa Darrow? Brother Cyrus? Good. Wasn't sure 
the descriptions I was given were accurate, but you match."
His voice is gravelly, confident. This is not a dwarf who wastes time with 
pleasantries.
"I'm Thordin Ironhelm, master delver and expedition leader. I'm 
here because I have a job that requires people with very specific 
skills: tactical thinking, combat proficiency, willingness to work in 
dangerous conditions, and-most importantly-discretion."
He looks at each of you in turn. "I've been asking around Haven for a 
skilled team. Your names came up more than once. Apparently 
you've done some impressive work recently."
Kessa's eyes narrow slightly. "What kind of job?"
Thordin grins. "The profitable kind. And before you ask-no, it's not 
resistance business. This is personal. Private. And it pays 
extremely well for relatively little risk compared to, say, infiltrating 
Dragon Army flagships or storming fortresses."
He clearly knows more about your recent activities than you'd expect a 
random dwarf to know.
"Interested?"
 
THE PROPOSITION
You invite Thordin into Haven's guest area-a private room where you can talk 
without being overheard.
Once seated, Thordin gets straight to business:
"I'm a professional delver. I explore old ruins, forgotten tombs, 
collapsed mines-places most people won't go. I find valuable 
things, I sell them, I make a good living. It's dangerous work, but 
I'm good at it."
He pulls out a worn map and spreads it on the table.
"Three weeks ago, I was contracted by a collector in Palanthas to 
locate a specific artifact: the Helm of Kharas. It's a dwarven relic from 
before the Cataclysm-ceremonial armor worn by Kharas, one of our greatest 
heroes. Historical value, religious significance, worth a fortune to the right 
buyer."**
He taps a location on the map-mountainous terrain, maybe 80 miles 
northeast of Haven.
"I tracked it to here: the ruins of Thoradin's Hall, an abandoned 
dwarven outpost that collapsed during the Cataclysm. The Helm is there. I'm 
certain of it. Problem is..."**
He pauses, choosing his words carefully.
"I need help getting it out. The place is structurally unstable, 
partially flooded, and inhabited by things that don't appreciate 
visitors. I'm good, but I'm not suicidal. I need a team."
Cyrus asks: "Why us specifically? There are other skilled fighters in 
Haven."
Thordin nods. "Fair question. Three reasons: First, you're skilled but 
not well-known outside resistance circles. This needs to stay 
quiet-my client doesn't want word spreading that the Helm is on 
the market. Second, you're not local dwarves who might have... 
complicated feelings about looting dwarven ruins. Third, you've 
proven you can handle high-risk operations and keep your mouths 
shut."
He leans forward. "Here's my offer: You help me retrieve the Helm 
from Thoradin's Hall. In exchange, you get 30% of the payment I 
receive from my client-that's 3,000 gold pieces, split however you 
want. Plus, anything else we find in the ruins is yours to keep. I 
only want the Helm."
"Timeline: Three to five days total. One day travel there, one to 
three days in the ruins depending on complications, one day back. 
Relatively low political stakes-no Dragon Army, no mass 
casualties, just professional dungeon delving."
He sits back. "So. Interested?"
 
ASSESSMENT
Kessa looks at you, eyebrow raised. This is clearly your call.
Cyrus seems... cautiously interested. A straightforward treasure recovery 
mission with no moral complexity might be exactly what he needs right now.
The money is substantial. 3,000 gold split three ways is 1,000 each-a 
significant payday for less than a week's work.
And Thordin seems legitimate. Gruff, professional, knows his business.
But there are always complications with "simple" jobs.
 
What do you do?
1.	Accept the job - Sounds like exactly what the party needs right now
2.	Ask more questions - What specific dangers? What else is in the 
ruins? Why the secrecy?
3.	Decline politely - Not interested in mercenary work
4.	Negotiate terms - Want more money, different split, or other 
conditions
5.	Something else?
Thordin waits patiently for your answer, his hands folded on the table.
Any thoughts, guys?
Dec 9
PARTY DISCUSSION
You turn to Kessa and Cyrus. "What do you two think?"
Kessa speaks first, her tone analytical: "It's straightforward work. No 
politics, no armies, no moral calculus about who deserves to die. 
We go in, navigate whatever dangers are there, grab the artifact, 
get paid. Clean."
She looks at Thordin directly. "My questions: What kind of 'things that 
don't appreciate visitors' are we talking about? Monsters? Traps? 
Rival delvers? And what makes the structure unstable enough that 
you need backup but not so unstable that we're risking burial?"
Thordin nods approvingly at the questions. "Smart. The 'things' are 
primarily darkmantles and what I believe is a grick colony in the 
lower levels. Cave predators, territorial but not organized. Traps 
exist but they're three centuries old-most are degraded, 
predictable. No rival delvers that I know of, but it's possible."
"As for structural stability: the place won't collapse randomly. But 
there are flooded sections, weakened supports, areas where heavy 
combat or explosive magic could cause problems. I need people 
who can handle threats efficiently without bringing the ceiling 
down."
 
Cyrus has been quiet, listening carefully. Now he speaks, his voice thoughtful:
"Johannes, I'll be honest-I think this is exactly what I need right 
now."
He looks at Thordin, then back to you. "A straightforward challenge. 
Solve problems, overcome obstacles, help someone accomplish a 
legitimate goal. No one dies except monsters that were going to kill 
us anyway. No weighing innocent lives against strategic necessity."
His expression is almost... hopeful? Like he's grasping for something normal, 
something that feels like adventuring instead of war.
"I'm not running from what I did in Flotsam," he clarifies. "But I 
need... I need to remember that I'm more than just the person who 
called that storm. I need to use my skills for something that doesn't 
end with me counting corpses."
He looks directly at you. "If you think it's worth doing, I'm in. If you 
have concerns, I'll listen. But... I want this."
 
Kessa adds: "Plus, 1,000 gold each is nothing to sneeze at. We've 
been taking resistance missions that pay in gratitude and strategic 
value. Having actual coin for equipment, supplies, or just... 
having-that's useful."
She leans back. "I don't see major red flags. Thordin's story checks 
out. The job is dangerous but manageable. The pay is fair. And 
honestly? Some old-fashioned dungeon crawling sounds pretty 
good right now."
 
Thordin watches the exchange with interest but doesn't pressure. He's letting 
you discuss it naturally.
What's your call, Johannes?
We can leave now...
Dec 9
DEPARTURE - IMMEDIATE
"We can leave now," you say decisively. "We're equipped, rested, and 
ready. No point waiting around."
Thordin grins broadly. "Now that's what I like to hear. Professional 
and efficient." He stands, rolling up the map. "We can resupply in 
Gateway if we need anything specific, but if you're already geared 
up, we'll make better time pushing straight through."
Kessa nods approvingly. "I'll grab my pack and weapons. Five 
minutes."
Cyrus stands as well, and for the first time in days, there's energy in his 
movement. "I'll let Laurana know we're taking a short contract. She 
should know we're leaving Haven."
 
BRIEF WITH LAURANA
You find Commander Laurana in the command center, reviewing reports. 
When you explain the situation-Thordin's offer, the dwarven relic recovery, 
three to five days-she listens carefully.
"A dungeon delve for a dwarven artifact," she says, a slight smile 
touching her lips. "Honestly, Commander, that sounds almost... 
refreshing. You've earned some time doing straightforward 
adventuring work."
She glances at Cyrus, noting the cautious hope in his expression, and her tone 
softens. "Brother Cyrus, this will be good for you. Sometimes the 
best medicine is remembering what you're capable of beyond the 
battlefield."
To you, she adds: "Keep your Sending Stone active. If an emergency 
arises, I'll contact you. Otherwise, take your time. Haven isn't going 
anywhere, and the Dragon Army is still licking its wounds from 
Flotsam. You've bought us breathing room."
"We'll be back in less than a week," you confirm.
"Safe travels. And try to have some fun-you've earned it."
 
DEPARTURE FROM HAVEN - AFTERNOON
Within thirty minutes, you're packed and ready. The party assembles at 
Haven's gate:
Johannes:
*	Full combat gear (studded leather, Trident of Warning, Amulet of 
Health, Ring of Mind Shielding)
*	Adventuring supplies (rope, rations, torches, etc.)
*	Potions: 2x Greater Healing, 1x Superior Healing
*	Scrolls: 2x Dimension Door
*	Bag of Holding (with various supplies)
*	~3,980 gp in funds
Kessa:
*	Bracers of Defense (AC 17), Rope of Entanglement, light armor
*	+1 ceremonial daggers, various weapons
*	Thieves' tools, infiltration gear
*	Potion of Superior Healing, Potion of Gaseous Form
*	~3,930 gp in funds
Cyrus:
*	Pearl of Power, Amulet of the Depths, Goggles of Night
*	Holy symbol of Mishakal, cleric gear
*	Full spell list prepared (4th level caster)
*	Healer's kit, religious implements
*	~3,930 gp in funds
Thordin Ironhelm:
*	Warhammer, climbing gear, specialized delving equipment
*	Dwarven plate armor (looks well-used but maintained)
*	Extensive rope, pitons, lanterns
*	Mining picks, pry bars, chalk for marking passages
*	A confidence that suggests he's done this many times before
 
THE JOURNEY NORTHEAST - DAY 1
The four of you set out on foot, heading northeast from Haven into 
increasingly mountainous terrain. The weather is clear, the trail is decent, and 
Thordin sets a steady pace.
As you walk, Thordin shares more details:
"Thoradin's Hall was built about 400 years ago as a forward 
outpost-combination waystation, mining operation, and defensive 
position. It was never huge-maybe 200 dwarves at peak 
occupancy. When the Cataclysm hit, the mountain shifted. Half the 
complex collapsed, the rest was abandoned."
"Why was the Helm there?" Cyrus asks.
"Kharas himself never set foot in Thoradin's Hall," Thordin 
explains. "But his Helm was given as a ceremonial gift to the 
outpost's commander-Thoradin, obviously-about fifty years 
before the Cataclysm. It's been sitting in the ruins ever since, 
assumed lost."
"How did you track it down?" Kessa asks.
Thordin taps his temple. "Research. Old records, survivor testimonies, 
connecting dots. Took me three months of digging through 
archives in Thorbardin. But I'm certain it's there-in the 
commander's vault, in what's now the deepest accessible level of 
the ruins."
 
EVENING CAMP - FIRST NIGHT
You make camp in a sheltered valley as the sun sets. Thordin proves to be an 
efficient camp-maker-he has the fire going and a decent stew cooking within 
minutes.
As you eat, the dwarf studies the three of you.
"So," he says conversationally, "I heard rumors about Flotsam. 
Something about a freak storm destroying the entire Dragon Army 
fleet. Fifteen ships, all wrecked in one night."
He looks at Cyrus specifically, though his tone remains casual. "Must've 
been some storm."
Cyrus stiffens slightly, but Thordin continues before anyone can respond:
"I'm not asking for details. Your business is your business. But I 
will say this: whoever managed that-however they managed it-
saved a lot of lives. Ak-Thyln, Kalaman, half the coastal cities. 
Those people will never know how close they came to Dragon Army 
occupation."
He raises his mug. "To the unknown heroes who stop invasions. May 
their burdens be light and their sleep peaceful."
It's clearly directed at Cyrus, but framed in a way that requires no confession, 
no discussion. Just acknowledgment.
Cyrus hesitates, then raises his own mug, his voice quiet: "May their 
sacrifices matter."
You all drink.
 
APPROACHING THORADIN'S HALL - LATE 
MORNING, DAY 2
By mid-morning of the second day, you reach the site.
Thoradin's Hall is built into the mountainside-or what's left of it. The 
entrance is a massive carved archway, now partially collapsed, with dwarven 
runes along the frame. Beyond, you can see darkness, broken stone, and the 
remnants of what was once an impressive structure.
The area around the entrance is overgrown with mountain scrub. There are 
old campsites-other delvers, adventurers, scavengers over the centuries-but 
nothing recent. The place has an abandoned, forgotten feel.
Thordin pulls out climbing gear and starts distributing rope. "Right. From 
here, it gets technical. The main entrance is stable enough, but 
once we're inside, we'll be navigating collapsed passages, flooded 
chambers, and vertical shafts. Stay together, watch your footing, 
and listen when I tell you something's dangerous."
He looks at each of you seriously. "This isn't a combat mission. This is 
exploration, problem-solving, and careful movement. Speed is less 
important than not dying. Clear?"
Everyone nods.
"Good. Let's go get that Helm."
 
ENTERING THORADIN'S HALL
You light lanterns (and Cyrus dons his Goggles of Night for darkvision), and 
the four of you step through the ancient entrance into the darkness beyond.
The air inside is cool, damp, and stale. Your footsteps echo. The architecture is 
distinctly dwarven-solid, geometric, built to last. But time and catastrophe 
have taken their toll. Rubble blocks passages, water drips from cracks, and 
everything is coated in dust and moss.
Thordin leads with confidence, marking passages with chalk, checking 
structural integrity before proceeding.
"The commander's vault is three levels down," he explains. "We'll 
need to navigate the main hall, descend through the old barracks 
level, bypass the flooded mining section, and reach the 
administrative level where the vault is located. Should take most of 
the day if we're careful."
Kessa is scouting ahead slightly, checking for traps or unstable ground. "I see 
tracks here-something's been moving through recently. Clawed, 
four-legged, medium-sized."
Thordin nods. "Darkmantles, probably. They nest in places like this. 
Not aggressive unless provoked, but they'll defend territory. We 
might have to fight."
You grip your Trident of Warning, feeling its magic alert you to potential 
danger ahead.
The adventure has begun.
 
What's your approach as you proceed deeper?
1.	Thordin leads, you follow his expertise (trust the professional 
delver)
2.	Kessa scouts ahead aggressively (find threats before they find you)
3.	Proceed as a tight group (maximum defensive formation)
4.	Something else?
The darkness stretches ahead, and somewhere deep below, the Helm of 
Kharas waits.
Don't forget the Cloak of Manta Ray... or may come in handy.
Dec 9
EQUIPMENT CHECK
Good point. Let me correct that.
Johannes currently has:
*	Cloak of Manta Ray (worn - provides water breathing and 60 ft swim 
speed)
*	Studded leather armor
*	Trident of Warning (attuned)
*	Amulet of Health (attuned)
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (attuned)
You're absolutely right-the Cloak will be extremely useful in the flooded 
sections Thordin mentioned. You kept it after giving it to Elara temporarily 
during the extraction.
 
PROCEEDING INTO THE RUINS
"I'll take point with Thordin," you say. "Kessa, scout about twenty 
feet ahead but stay in sight. Cyrus, rear guard with support ready. 
And Thordin's right-we follow his expertise on structural safety. 
No unnecessary risks."
Thordin nods approvingly. "Smart. And Commander-that cloak you're 
wearing. That's water-breathing magic, isn't it?"
"It is. Sixty-foot swim speed too."
"Perfect. The flooded mining section is going to require swimming 
through about fifty feet of fully submerged tunnel. Most people 
would need potions or spells for that. You can just... go. That'll 
make things easier."
He points ahead into the darkness. "Let's move. Stay alert."
 
THE MAIN HALL - LEVEL 1
The first chamber you enter is massive-a grand hall that once served as the 
heart of the outpost. Carved pillars (some cracked, some fallen) support a 
vaulted ceiling about forty feet up. Dwarven reliefs cover the walls-scenes of 
mining, craftsmanship, warfare.
Everything is coated in centuries of dust and decay.
Perception checks:
*	Johannes (Trident of Warning advantage on initiative): 18 + 3 
= 21
*	Kessa: Natural 20 + 7 = 27 (Exceptional)
*	Cyrus (Goggles of Night): 14 + 4 = 18
*	Thordin: 16 + 5 = 21
Kessa spots it first: High on the ceiling, clinging to the stonework near one 
of the pillars-a darkmantle. It's a creature that resembles a stalactite until 
it attacks, then reveals itself as a tentacled beast that drops onto prey and tries 
to suffocate them.
She signals silently: Threat above. One, maybe more.
Thordin whispers: "They hunt by ambush. If we move quietly and 
don't threaten them, they might let us pass. But if we spook 
them..."
Kessa adds quietly: "I count three. One on the pillar to the left, two 
near the far entrance. If we fight, we need to be fast-their 
suffocation attack is nasty."
 
How do you proceed?
1.	Move quietly through, avoid engagement (Stealth checks, hope 
they don't attack)
2.	Preemptive strike (Kessa shoots one, you attack others before they 
can drop)
3.	Loud distraction (Draw them to one side, party moves past on the 
other)
4.	Thordin's expertise (Let him handle it-he's done this before)
5.	Something else?
The darkmantles haven't moved yet-they're in ambush mode, waiting for 
prey to walk underneath them.
Is it safer we take care of them or would that draw more unwelcome 
attention?
Dec 9
THORDIN'S ASSESSMENT
You whisper to Thordin: "Is it safer to take them out now, or would 
fighting draw more unwelcome attention?"
Thordin studies the darkmantles carefully, his experienced eye evaluating the 
situation.
"Good question. Here's my read: Darkmantles are territorial but 
not pack hunters-they don't call for help. If we kill these three, 
we're done with them. They won't alert anything else."
He pauses, considering. "The danger is the NOISE of fighting. A quick, 
quiet kill is fine. But if there's a lot of crashing around, spell 
explosions, creatures shrieking as they die... that could wake up the 
grick colony deeper down. And trust me, you don't want to deal 
with gricks unless you have to."
Kessa whispers: "I can drop one silently with my bow before it knows 
we're here. If the rest of you can take the other two fast-no loud 
spells, just weapons-we should be clean."
Thordin nods. "Aye. Fast and quiet. Don't let them get into the air 
where they can maneuver. Pin them on the ceiling or kill them 
before they drop."
Cyrus adds quietly: "I can use Sacred Flame if needed-it's radiant 
damage, not explosive. Relatively quiet. Or I can heal if someone 
gets grabbed."
 
Tactical assessment:
PROS of killing them now:
*	Clear the path, no threat on return journey
*	Prevents ambush if we retreat this way
*	Darkmantles won't alert other creatures
CONS of killing them:
*	Combat noise might attract gricks from deeper levels
*	Risk of one escaping and causing problems later
*	Uses some resources (spell slots, ammunition)
PROS of sneaking past:
*	No combat noise at all
*	Saves resources for deeper threats
*	Faster progress
CONS of sneaking past:
*	They'll still be here when we return (potential ambush on exit)
*	Risk of failed stealth check triggering combat anyway
*	Leaves hostile creatures at our back
 
Thordin adds one more thought: "My experience? Kill them now if you 
can do it quietly. Better to control the engagement than risk them 
dropping on us during retreat when we're tired or injured. But if 
you think stealth is your strength..." He looks at Kessa, clearly 
respecting her professional judgment.
What's your call?
1.	Kill them quickly and quietly (Kessa snipes, party rushes the 
others)
2.	Sneak past (Group stealth check, hope they don't notice)
3.	Something else?
Is EB loud?
Dec 9
ELDRITCH BLAST - NOISE ASSESSMENT
Good question. Let's think about this:
Eldritch Blast mechanically has no verbal or somatic components (it's just a 
cantrip you can cast at will), but narratively it's a beam of crackling eldritch 
energy.
Thordin's assessment:
"Eldritch magic? Depends on how you cast it. If it's a quiet beam-
like a focused lance of energy-that's fine. If it CRACKS like 
lightning or BOOMS when it hits, that's loud."
He looks at you. "How does yours manifest? Some warlocks I've seen 
shoot silent shadow beams. Others blast with thunder-crack force. 
What's yours like?"
 
This is actually your call, Johannes. How have you been 
manifesting your Eldritch Blast?
Given your patron is a demon and you're a Fiend warlock, it probably has 
some hellish or dark quality to it. But the sound level is flexible.
Possible manifestations:
1.	Silent/Quiet: Dark purple-black beam that impacts with a dull thud 
(like being punched)
2.	Moderate: Crackling dark energy with a hiss/sizzle sound on impact
3.	Loud: Booming infernal blast with explosive impact
For purposes of this situation, I'd say:
*	Options 1-2 are "quiet enough" - won't alert distant creatures
*	Option 3 is "loud" - would risk attracting gricks
What's your Eldritch Blast like?
1.	The descriptions in the past have usually include that kind of vibe.
I'll use Hex and EB on one target, EB on the other...
Dec 9
COMBAT - DARKMANTLE AMBUSH 
NEUTRALIZATION
"We take them out," you decide. "Fast and quiet."
You point to the darkmantles. "Kessa, rightmost one-your bow, silent 
kill. I'll take the one on the pillar with Hex and Eldritch Blast. 
Cyrus, be ready for the third if it drops or tries to flee. Thordin, 
backup."
Everyone nods, moving into position.
You focus on the darkmantle clinging to the carved pillar, speaking the words 
of your Hex curse under your breath. Dark energy coils around the creature-
it doesn't notice yet, still in ambush mode.
"On three," Kessa whispers, arrow nocked. "One... two... THREE."
 
SURPRISE ROUND
Kessa's Attack (Sneak Attack, target surprised):
*	Attack roll: 17 + 7 = 24 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d6+4 (dagger) + 3d6 (sneak attack) = 4 + 11 = 15 damage
Her arrow flies true, striking the rightmost darkmantle directly through its 
central mass. The creature convulses once, then goes limp, falling silently to 
the stone floor below. Dead before it knew danger existed.
One down.
 
Johannes's Attack (Hex + Eldritch Blast, target surprised):
You raise your hand, and twin beams of crackling dark purple-black energy 
lance out toward the darkmantle on the pillar. The air hisses and sizzles as the 
eldritch force tears through the space.
*	First beam: Attack roll: 16 + 7 = 23 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 7 + 4 = 11 damage
*	Second beam: Attack roll: 19 + 7 = 26 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 8 + 3 = 11 damage
Total: 22 damage
The twin beams strike the darkmantle with crackling impacts-HISS-CRACK, 
HISS-CRACK-punching through its body. The creature shrieks briefly (a wet, 
strangled sound) as it dies, then tumbles from the pillar and hits the floor with 
a heavy thud.
Two down.
The sound of your Eldritch Blast echoes briefly in the vast hall-definitely 
audible, but not explosive. More like the sound of energy discharging than 
thunder.
 
The Third Darkmantle - REACTION:
The remaining darkmantle, realizing its companions are dead, makes a split-
second decision: attack or flee?
Morale check (Wisdom save): 8 - 1 = 7 (FAIL - it panics)
It drops from its perch, but instead of attacking, it tries to glide-fall toward a 
side passage-fleeing deeper into the ruins where it might find safety.
 
Cyrus's Readied Action (Sacred Flame):
The cleric was waiting for exactly this. He raises his holy symbol, and radiant 
light flares.
"You will not escape to warn others," he says calmly.
Sacred Flame (DEX save DC 15):
*	Darkmantle DEX save: 6 + 1 = 7 (FAIL)
*	Damage: 2d8 radiant = 11 damage
The holy fire engulfs the fleeing darkmantle mid-flight. It shrieks once-a 
horrible, wet sound-then burns and falls, dead before it hits the ground.
All three darkmantles eliminated.
 
AFTERMATH - LISTENING FOR RESPONSE
The hall falls silent except for the faint echo of combat fading into the depths.
Everyone freezes, listening intently.
Perception checks (listening for distant movement):
*	Johannes: 14 + 3 = 17
*	Kessa: 18 + 7 = 25
*	Cyrus: 12 + 4 = 16
*	Thordin: 15 + 5 = 20
Kessa (highest roll) hears:
Faint sounds from deeper in the complex-scratching, shifting. Not 
immediate, not approaching, but... aware. Something deeper down heard the 
combat and is stirring.
"We've got attention," Kessa whispers. "Not coming toward us yet, 
but something down there knows we're here."
Thordin nods grimly. "Gricks, probably. They're sensitive to 
vibrations. But they won't come up here-they prefer ambushing in 
their own territory. As long as we're careful when we reach their 
level, we'll be fine."
He examines the dead darkmantles briefly. "Clean kills. Well done. Let's 
keep moving-standing around just gives them more time to 
prepare."
 
COMBAT SUMMARY
Party:
*	No damage taken
*	Resources used: 1 arrow (Kessa), 1 Hex (Johannes - still active, can be 
moved), 1 Sacred Flame (Cyrus)
*	Time: Less than 6 seconds
Enemy:
*	3 Darkmantles eliminated
*	No escape, no alarm raised
Tactical result: Perfect execution. Quiet, efficient, professional.
Cyrus looks... focused. Alert. He's in the zone-this is problem-solving, not 
warfare. He's clearly more comfortable here than he was during the storm.
 
DESCENDING TO LEVEL 2 - THE BARRACKS
Thordin leads you through the main hall to a wide staircase descending into 
darkness. The steps are worn but stable-dwarven construction holding up 
even after centuries.
"The barracks level," Thordin explains as you descend. "This is where 
the garrison lived. Should be mostly empty-just old bunks, storage 
rooms, maybe some rats. The real danger starts at Level 3, the 
flooded mining section."
The air grows cooler and damper as you descend. Your lights reveal row after 
row of stone bunks, long since abandoned. Personal effects-rusted weapons, 
rotted leather, broken furniture-litter the floor.
It's eerily quiet.
Too quiet.
Kessa signals: Something's wrong. No rats, no bats, no scavengers. This 
level should have SOME life.
Thordin frowns. "Aye. That's odd. Usually places like this have-"
Your Trident of Warning suddenly tingles with alert.
INITIATIVE - AMBUSH!
 
From the shadows between the bunks, shapes emerge-
Four creatures that look like serpentine worms with bony beaks and 
tentacles around their mouths. They're each about 8 feet long, moving with 
disturbing speed.
Gricks. They came UP from Level 3 to investigate the noise.
ROLL INITIATIVE:
*	Johannes (Trident advantage): 19 + 3 = 22
*	Kessa: 16 + 5 = 21
*	Cyrus: 14 + 2 = 16
*	Thordin: 12 + 2 = 14
*	Gricks: 8 + 0 = 8
You're not surprised (thanks to Trident of Warning), but the gricks are 
attacking aggressively-they've marked you as threats to their territory.
 
ROUND 1 - INITIATIVE ORDER:
1.	Johannes (22)
2.	Kessa (21)
3.	Cyrus (16)
4.	Thordin (14)
5.	Gricks (8)
The four gricks are spreading out-two approaching from the left (between 
bunks), two from the right. They're about 30 feet away and closing fast.
What do you do?
Remind me...gricks??
Dec 9
GRICKS - CREATURE KNOWLEDGE
Gricks are aberrations-worm-like predators that hunt in underground 
environments.
What you know (general knowledge):
Appearance:
*	8 feet long, serpentine body
*	Rubbery, stone-gray skin
*	Tentacled mouth with a sharp beak at the center
*	Move like snakes but can rear up to strike
Behavior:
*	Pack hunters, ambush predators
*	Detect prey through vibration and scent
*	Territorial, defend their hunting grounds aggressively
*	Not particularly intelligent but cunning hunters
Combat capabilities:
*	Tentacle attacks (reach, can grapple)
*	Beak bite (nasty damage if they get hold of you)
*	Stone Camouflage - blend into rocky environments, hard to spot 
when still
*	Damage Resistance - Their rubbery hide is resistant to non-magical 
physical damage (swords, arrows, etc. do half damage unless magical)
Weaknesses:
*	Vulnerable to magic (spells work normally)
*	Magical weapons bypass their resistance
*	Fire and radiant damage are particularly effective
*	Not very smart-can be outmaneuvered tactically
 
YOUR PARTY'S ADVANTAGES:
*	Johannes: Eldritch Blast (magical force damage, full effectiveness) + 
Trident of Warning is +1 (magical, bypasses resistance)
*	Kessa: +1 ceremonial daggers (magical, bypass resistance)
*	Cyrus: All his spells work normally (Sacred Flame, etc.)
*	Thordin: Likely has magical warhammer or knows to use magic
TACTICAL CONCERN: There are four of them, and they're spreading out 
to attack from multiple angles. They want to surround and overwhelm you.
 
You're up first (Initiative 22). Four gricks, 30 feet away, closing 
fast, two from each side.
What do you do?
Transfer Hex and eb closest grick
Dec 9
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN
You quickly assess the battlefield. Four gricks, spreading to flank. The two on 
the left are slightly closer-one is practically slithering over an old stone bunk 
toward you.
You transfer your Hex from the dead darkmantle to the nearest grick on the 
left-the curse shifts instantly, dark energy coiling around the creature. It 
hisses in displeasure, sensing the malevolent magic.
Then you unleash your Eldritch Blast.
 
Eldritch Blast (2 beams, both at Hexed grick):
First beam:
*	Attack roll: 13 + 7 = 20 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 damage
Second beam:
*	Attack roll: 11 + 7 = 18 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17 damage
Total: 29 damage
The twin beams of crackling dark energy HISS-CRACK through the air, 
slamming into the lead grick. The first beam punches through its rubbery hide 
with a wet thunk, the second beam tears a massive hole through its 
midsection.
The grick convulses violently, its tentacles flailing, then collapses in a heap. 
Dark ichor pools beneath it.
One grick down. Three remaining.
 
KESSA'S TURN
"Right side!" Kessa calls out, pivoting to face the two gricks approaching 
from that direction.
She draws both her +1 ceremonial daggers in a fluid motion and moves 
forward to engage before they can close on Cyrus and Thordin.
Attack 1 (Grick #2):
*	Attack roll: 16 + 7 = 23 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d4+4 (magical dagger) + 3d6 (sneak attack) = 3 + 4 + 12 = 19 
damage
Her first dagger finds the gap between the creature's body segments, driving 
deep. The grick shrieks-a horrible wet sound-and recoils.
Attack 2 (same grick, bonus action off-hand):
*	Attack roll: 14 + 7 = 21 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d4+4 (magical dagger) = 2 + 4 = 6 damage
Her second blade follows immediately, slashing across the grick's "face" area 
where its tentacles cluster. More ichor sprays.
Grick #2 badly wounded but still alive.
Kessa backs up slightly, keeping both right-side gricks in her line of 
sight. "These things are tough!"
 
CYRUS'S TURN
Cyrus raises his holy symbol, targeting the wounded grick that Kessa just 
mauled.
"Burn in Mishakal's light!"
Sacred Flame (DEX save DC 15):
*	Grick DEX save: 4 + 0 = 4 (FAIL)
*	Damage: 2d8 radiant = 13 damage
Holy fire descends from above, engulfing the wounded grick. It writhes in the 
radiant flames, its rubbery skin blistering and blackening, then goes still.
Grick #2 dead. Two remaining.
Cyrus looks focused, professional. This is familiar territory-clerics fighting 
aberrations. No moral complexity, just holy wrath against unnatural creatures.
 
THORDIN'S TURN
"FOR THORBARDIN!" the dwarf bellows, charging the remaining grick on 
the left side (the one near Johannes).
His warhammer glows with faint magical light-definitely enchanted.
Attack (Grick #3):
*	Attack roll: 18 + 6 = 24 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d8+4 (magical warhammer) + 2 (rage? or just dwarf 
strength?) = 7 + 6 = 13 damage
The warhammer crashes into the grick's midsection with a 
sickening CRUNCH. Bones break, ichor spatters. The grick reels backward, 
wounded but still fighting.
"These bastards hunt in MY mountains!" Thordin snarls. He's clearly 
taken this personally.
 
GRICKS' TURN (2 remaining)
Grick #3 (wounded, near Johannes and Thordin) lashes out with its tentacles 
at Thordin, the closest threat.
Tentacle attack:
*	Attack roll: 12 + 4 = 16 vs Thordin's AC (probably 18 in plate?)
*	MISS
The tentacles whip past Thordin's head, but the dwarf ducks under them with 
practiced ease. "Too slow, worm!"
 
Grick #4 (unwounded, right side) tries to get past Kessa to reach the "softer" 
targets (Cyrus).
Tentacle attack on Kessa:
*	Attack roll: 15 + 4 = 19 vs Kessa's AC 17
*	HIT
*	Damage: 2d6+2 = 7 + 2 = 9 damage
*	Grapple attempt (STR contest): Grick STR 14 vs Kessa STR 9
*	Kessa is GRAPPLED
The grick's tentacles wrap around Kessa's arm and torso, pulling her closer 
toward its beaked maw. She struggles but can't break free immediately.
"Little help here!" she calls out, slashing at the tentacles with her free hand 
but unable to get good leverage.
 
ROUND 2 - INITIATIVE ORDER
Current situation:
*	Grick #1: Dead (Johannes killed)
*	Grick #2: Dead (Kessa + Cyrus killed)
*	Grick #3: Wounded, engaged with Thordin (left side)
*	Grick #4: Unwounded, has Kessa grappled (right side)
Party status:
*	Johannes: Unharmed
*	Kessa: 9 damage taken, grappled
*	Cyrus: Unharmed
*	Thordin: Unharmed
Your turn (Initiative 22). What do you do?
Options:
1.	Blast the grick grappling Kessa (EB at range, risk hitting Kessa if 
you roll really badly?)
2.	Move to melee, stab it with Trident (magical weapon, helps Kessa 
directly)
3.	Use Maddening Hex (bonus action, 4 psychic damage to hexed target 
and all within 5 feet-but the hex is on the dead grick #1)
4.	Transfer Hex and blast (move hex to grick #4, then EB it)
5.	Something else?
Don't forget, she also has a +1 hand crossbow
Dec 9
CORRECTION - KESSA'S WEAPONS
You're absolutely right! Let me update Kessa's equipment:
Kessa's weapons:
*	2x +1 Ceremonial Daggers (melee, ignore necrotic resistance)
*	+1 Hand Crossbow (ranged)
*	Short sword (backup)
*	Javelins x4
She definitely would have opened with the hand crossbow from range rather 
than charging into melee with daggers. Let me rewind her turn:
 
KESSA'S TURN (CORRECTED)
Kessa quickly assesses the two gricks approaching from the right. She draws 
her +1 hand crossbow and fires at the lead creature.
Hand Crossbow Attack (Grick #2):
*	Attack roll: 16 + 7 = 23 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d6+4 (magical crossbow) + 3d6 (sneak attack) = 4 + 4 + 12 
= 20 damage
The bolt punches through the grick's rubbery hide. The creature shrieks and 
writhes but keeps coming.
She quickly reloads (free object interaction) and fires again.
Second Attack (Bonus Action - Crossbow Expert feat if she has it, or 
just her second attack):
*	Attack roll: 14 + 7 = 21 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d6+4 = 3 + 4 = 7 damage
Another bolt strikes true. The grick is badly wounded but still advancing.
 
The rest of the round proceeds as described (Cyrus finishes it off with Sacred 
Flame, etc.).
 
BACK TO CURRENT SITUATION - ROUND 2
Current battlefield:
*	Grick #3: Wounded, engaged with Thordin (left side)
*	Grick #4: Unwounded, about 15 feet from Kessa (right side), advancing
Party status:
*	Johannes: Unharmed
*	Kessa: Unharmed (she wasn't in melee range to be grappled)
*	Cyrus: Unharmed
*	Thordin: Unharmed
Actually, let me recalculate Grick #4's action since Kessa wasn't in melee:
Grick #4's turn (revised): It charges toward Kessa, covering 30 feet (it's 
fast). It's now within 10 feet of her but hasn't attacked yet.
 
ROUND 2 - YOUR TURN
You're up first (Initiative 22).
Current situation:
*	Grick #3 (wounded) engaged with Thordin on left
*	Grick #4 (unwounded) closing on Kessa on right, about 10 feet away
*	Your Hex is still on dead Grick #1 (need to transfer if you want to use it)
What do you do?
Transfer Hex and eb #4.
Dec 9
ROUND 2 - JOHANNES'S TURN
You quickly transfer the Hex curse from the dead grick to the unwounded one 
advancing on Kessa (#4). Dark energy coils around the creature as it closes the 
distance.
"Kessa, clear!" you call out, then unleash your Eldritch Blast.
 
Eldritch Blast (2 beams, both at Hexed Grick #4):
First beam:
*	Attack roll: 14 + 7 = 21 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 9 + 4 + 4 = 17 damage
Second beam:
*	Attack roll: 16 + 7 = 23 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 damage
Total: 29 damage
The twin beams of crackling dark energy HISS-CRACK through the barracks, 
slamming into the advancing grick. The first beam punches a hole through its 
midsection, the second tears through its "neck" area where body meets 
tentacled head.
The creature convulses, tentacles flailing wildly, then collapses in a heap just 
feet away from Kessa. Dark ichor pools across the ancient stone floor.
Grick #4 dead.
Kessa nods appreciatively. "Clean shot. Thanks."
 
KESSA'S TURN
With the immediate threat to her eliminated, Kessa pivots and aims her +1 
hand crossbow at the remaining grick (#3) that's engaged with Thordin.
Hand Crossbow Attack (Grick #3):
*	Attack roll: 18 + 7 = 25 (Hit)
*	Sneak attack applies (Thordin is adjacent, giving advantage situation)
*	Damage: 1d6+4 + 3d6 (sneak attack) = 5 + 4 + 10 = 19 damage
The bolt strikes the grick in what passes for its head, right between its 
tentacles. The creature shudders violently.
Grick #3 is now critically wounded.
 
CYRUS'S TURN
Cyrus raises his holy symbol, targeting the last grick.
"Mishakal's light, purge this abomination!"
Sacred Flame (DEX save DC 15):
*	Grick DEX save: 6 + 0 = 6 (FAIL)
*	Damage: 2d8 radiant = 14 damage
Holy fire descends from above, engulfing the wounded grick. It writhes in the 
flames, its rubbery skin blackening and peeling, tentacles thrashing weakly-
Then it goes still. Dead.
Combat Over. All four gricks eliminated.
 
AFTERMATH - THE BARRACKS LEVEL
The barracks fall silent except for your heavy breathing and the faint drip of 
water somewhere in the darkness.
Four grick corpses lie scattered across the ancient stone floor, their ichor 
pooling in the cracks between flagstones.
Combat Summary:
*	Duration: 2 rounds (~12 seconds)
*	Party damage: None
*	Resources used: 2 Eldritch Blasts (cantrip), 3 crossbow bolts (Kessa), 
2 Sacred Flames (cantrip), Thordin's one warhammer swing
*	Hex: Still active, can be transferred
Thordin wipes grick ichor off his warhammer with a rag. "Well fought. 
Fast, coordinated, efficient. These things can be nasty if they get 
their tentacles on you."
He looks around the barracks warily. "Four of them came UP from Level 
3. That means the colony down there is larger than I thought. We'll 
need to be even more careful when we reach the flooded section."
Cyrus is breathing heavily but looks... good. Focused. Alive. This is the kind of 
challenge he thrives on-clear enemies, straightforward combat, using his 
abilities to protect his companions.
"Everyone alright?" he asks, already moving to check for injuries even 
though no one took damage.
Kessa is reloading her crossbow, professional as always. "I'm good. That 
was clean work."
 
PROCEEDING TO LEVEL 3 - THE FLOODED 
MINING SECTION
Thordin leads you deeper, down another set of stairs. The air grows 
significantly colder and damper. You can hear water now-dripping, flowing, 
echoing through stone passages.
"This is where it gets tricky," Thordin explains as you reach the bottom of 
the stairs. "The mining section was partially flooded when the 
Cataclysm shifted the water table. There's a main passage that's 
completely submerged-about fifty feet long, maybe twelve feet 
underwater. Beyond that is the administrative level where the 
commander's vault is located."
He gestures ahead into darkness. You can see water-black, still, reflecting 
your lantern light. The passage simply... disappears into the flooded section.
"Most people would need water breathing magic or potions. 
You," he nods to you, "have that cloak. You can swim through, scout 
the far side, make sure it's safe, then come back and we'll figure out 
how to get the rest of us through."
Kessa asks: "What about the gricks? They're amphibious, aren't 
they?"
"Aye," Thordin confirms grimly. "They can operate underwater. And if 
there's a colony down here, they might have sentries in the flooded 
passages. That's why I need someone who can move through water 
quickly and defend themselves if needed."
He looks at you. "You up for scouting ahead?"
 
Current situation:
*	You're at the entrance to the flooded section
*	50 feet of completely submerged passage ahead
*	Unknown threats (possibly gricks) in the water
*	Your Cloak of Manta Ray gives you 60 ft swim speed + water breathing
*	Your Trident of Warning will alert you to danger
*	Your Hex is still active (can be used on underwater threats)
What's your plan?
1.	Scout ahead solo (fastest, but you're alone if there's trouble)
2.	Cast Water Breathing on everyone first (Cyrus can ritual cast it, 
takes 10 minutes)
3.	Use Potion of Water Breathing (party-sized, immediate effect, but 
uses a resource)
4.	Try to find an alternate route (might take hours, might not exist)
5.	Something else?
Thordin adds: "Whatever you decide, decide quickly. Those gricks we 
killed? Their colony knows something killed them. The longer we 
wait, the more time they have to prepare an ambush."
I'll go first with cloak and one end of the rope of entanglement of Kessa's. 
When I get there, I take off the cloak and send it back with the rope. One at a 
time, those ahead setting up a beach head to protect the transfer of the other 
folks. Kessa is the last since she's controlling the rope. Thoughts?
Dec 9
TACTICAL PLAN REVIEW
You lay out the plan to the group:
"I'll swim through first with the Cloak and one end of Kessa's Rope 
of Entanglement. When I reach the far side, I'll take off the Cloak 
and send it back on the rope. Each person uses the Cloak to swim 
through one at a time-those who've crossed establish a defensive 
position while we transfer the others. Kessa goes last since she's 
controlling the rope."
 
TEAM ASSESSMENT
Kessa nods immediately. "Smart. The Rope can extend up to 30 
feet and I can command it to pull or guide. So I send it through with 
you, you secure the far end, then I command it to return with the 
Cloak. Each person clips the Cloak on, I command the rope to guide 
them through, they unclip and send it back. Efficient."
Cyrus considers. "Defensive positioning on the far side makes 
sense-we don't want everyone emerging into an ambush. And 
staggering the crossings means if something attacks, we're not all 
trapped in the water at once."
Thordin strokes his beard thoughtfully. "It's solid. My only concern 
is the transfer time. Each person needs to don the Cloak, swim 
through, remove it, send it back-that's maybe two minutes per 
person? So eight to ten minutes total for all four of us?"
He glances back the way you came. "That's not too long. But it does give 
the gricks time to notice what we're doing. If they're smart, they 
might try to attack during the transfer when we're split."
Kessa shrugs. "Then those of us on the far side defend while the 
transfer completes. Better than everyone swimming through blind 
and hoping for the best."
 
ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATION
Cyrus offers: "I could ritual cast Water Breathing on all of us. 
Takes ten minutes, but then we all swim through together as a 
coordinated unit. No splitting the party, no vulnerable transfer 
window."
The trade-off:
*	Your plan: Faster initial start (2 minutes to get first person through), 
but 8-10 minutes total, party split during transfer
*	Water Breathing ritual: 10 minutes of waiting before anyone goes, 
but then everyone crosses together in ~30 seconds
Thordin's tactical assessment: "Both work. Your way is faster to get 
eyes on the far side-you'll know what we're dealing with in two 
minutes instead of ten. The ritual is safer overall but gives the 
gricks more time to prepare and makes us sitting ducks for ten 
minutes while we cast."
He looks at you. "Your call, Commander. You're the one who's proven 
you can handle high-risk operations."
 
ADDITIONAL DETAIL - THE FLOODED PASSAGE
Thordin shows you where the passage enters the water. "It's about twelve 
feet deep here, and the ceiling is just a foot or two above the water 
surface. Once you're in, you're fully submerged. The passage runs 
straight for about forty feet, then angles up-the far side emerges 
into a chamber that should be dry."
"Should be dry?" Kessa asks.
"It was dry when I scouted this three months ago. But water levels 
can change. Worst case, the far chamber is also flooded, but I 
doubt it-the administrative level was built higher, deliberately 
above flood risk."
 
So your options:
OPTION A: Your Cloak Transfer Plan
*	Johannes scouts ahead now (2 minutes)
*	Establish beachhead on far side
*	Transfer others one at a time (8-10 minutes total)
*	Pros: Fast initial intel, defensive positioning, flexible response
*	Cons: Party split during transfer, vulnerable window
OPTION B: Water Breathing Ritual First
*	Wait 10 minutes while Cyrus casts
*	Everyone swims through together (30 seconds)
*	Pros: Party stays together, coordinated assault capability, no transfer 
vulnerability
*	Cons: 10 minutes stationary, gricks have more prep time, no advance 
intel
OPTION C: Hybrid
*	Johannes scouts NOW with Cloak (2 minutes)
*	While you're gone, Cyrus starts ritual (10 minutes)
*	By the time you return with intel, ritual is done
*	Everyone swims through together based on your scout report
*	Pros: Get intel AND coordinated crossing
*	Cons: If you encounter trouble during scout, party can't help for 10+ 
minutes
 
What's your decision?
C
Dec 9
HYBRID PLAN - EXECUTION
"We do both," you decide. "Cyrus, start the ritual for Water 
Breathing now. I'll scout ahead with the Cloak-by the time I'm 
back with intel, you'll be done casting and we can all cross together 
based on what I find."
Cyrus nods immediately. "Smart. That gives us the best of both 
approaches." He sits down cross-legged near the water's edge, pulling out 
his holy symbol and beginning the ritual chant. His voice echoes softly 
through the chamber as divine magic begins to gather.
Thordin approves. "Good call. We'll know what's ahead AND be ready 
to move as a unit. I'll keep watch while you're gone-make sure 
nothing sneaks up on us from behind."
Kessa checks her crossbow. "Ten minutes. Be careful down there, 
Johannes. If you run into a nest of gricks, don't play hero-just get 
back here."
"I'll be careful," you assure her.
 
SOLO RECONNAISSANCE - INTO THE FLOODED 
PASSAGE
You adjust your Cloak of Manta Ray, feeling its magic settle more firmly 
around you. The water-breathing effect is already active, and you can feel your 
body preparing for the swim-streamlined, efficient, comfortable.
You grip your Trident of Warning in your right hand. Its magic tingles against 
your palm, alert and ready.
Taking a breath of air (old habit, even though you don't need to), you step into 
the black water.
 
THE DESCENT
The water is cold-not freezing, but significantly colder than the air above. The 
Cloak helps moderate it, but you still feel the chill.
You descend smoothly, your enhanced swim speed making the movement 
effortless. 12 feet down, then forward into the submerged passage.
Your darkvision (Devil's Sight) reveals:
The passage is exactly as Thordin described-carved stone, about 8 feet wide, 
10 feet tall (from the current water level to the ceiling, which is just 1-2 feet 
above the surface). The walls show tool marks from dwarven miners. 
Everything is covered in algae and silt.
Visibility underwater is poor-maybe 20 feet with your Devil's Sight, but the 
water itself is murky with sediment.
You swim forward, covering the 40 feet of straight passage in seconds (your 60 
ft swim speed makes this trivial). Then the passage angles upward, as Thordin 
said.
 
PERCEPTION CHECK - UNDERWATER
Roll: 16 + 3 = 19
As you swim, you notice several things:
1.	Claw marks on the walls - Recent (not centuries-old). Something has 
been moving through here repeatedly. The scratches are consistent with 
grick claws.
2.	Disturbed sediment - The silt on the passage floor shows multiple 
tracks. Whatever's been using this route uses it regularly.
3.	A side alcove - About 30 feet into the passage, there's a small alcove in 
the right wall, maybe 6 feet deep. It's dark, hidden. Perfect ambush 
point.
4.	Movement ahead - Just at the edge of your visibility, where the 
passage angles upward toward the surface, you see something shift in 
the darkness.
Your Trident of Warning tingles sharply. Danger ahead.
 
STEALTH CHECK - REMAINING UNDETECTED
You're a dark shape moving through dark water. Do you try to approach 
stealthily, or do you investigate the threat openly?
If you proceed stealthily:
*	Stealth check (with disadvantage underwater? Or does your swim speed 
negate that?)
*	You could get closer to identify the threat before it notices you
If you investigate openly:
*	You announce your presence but maintain control
*	Less chance of being ambushed, but they know you're here
If you retreat immediately:
*	You've confirmed there ARE threats here
*	You can report back and plan accordingly
Your Trident is warning you of danger, but not imminent attack-
yet.
What do you do?
Yes, I think the swim speed offsets underwater. I proceed with stealth 
investigation.
Dec 10
STEALTH INVESTIGATION - UNDERWATER
You slow your movement, using the Cloak's enhanced swim speed to glide 
silently through the water rather than creating turbulence. The magic helps-
your body moves with almost supernatural grace, disturbing minimal water.
Stealth Check (DEX +5):
*	Roll: 17 + 5 = 22 (Excellent)
You drift forward like a shadow, keeping low, using the algae-covered walls for 
concealment. The disturbed sediment helps mask your approach-the water is 
already murky enough that your dark form blends naturally.
 
WHAT YOU DISCOVER
As you approach the area where the passage angles upward, the threat 
becomes clear:
Two gricks are positioned at the bend where the passage rises toward the 
surface. They're not actively patrolling-they're waiting. Ambush predators in 
perfect ambush position.
Positioning:
*	Grick #1: Coiled in that side alcove you noticed earlier (30 feet back). 
It's camouflaged against the stone, tentacles tucked in, waiting for prey 
to swim past.
*	Grick #2: At the upward angle itself (40 feet ahead), partially obscured 
by the bend. It's the one you saw move-it shifted slightly but hasn't 
detected you yet.
Their strategy is obvious: Anything swimming through gets ambushed 
from behind by Grick #1, then caught at the surface by Grick #2. Classic 
pincer.
Your Perception (focusing now that you know they're there):
*	Roll: 14 + 3 = 17
The gricks are alert but not alarmed. They're waiting for prey, but they don't 
know you're here yet. Their stone camouflage is good-if you hadn't been 
moving carefully and watching for threats, you might have swum right into 
their ambush.
Additional observation: Beyond Grick #2, you can see the passage does 
indeed angle up and break the surface. There's a faint glow-possibly 
bioluminescent fungi or reflection from the chamber beyond. The "dry" 
chamber Thordin mentioned is real.
 
TACTICAL ASSESSMENT
You're in a strong position:
*	They don't know you're here
*	You can see both of them
*	Your Trident of Warning means they can't surprise you even if they 
detect you
*	Your swim speed (60 ft) is faster than theirs
*	Hex + Eldritch Blast would work fine underwater (force damage has no 
penalties)
Your options:
1.	Retreat and report - Bring intel back, party comes through prepared 
for ambush (safest, gives you numbers advantage)
2.	Ambush the ambushers - Strike first while you have surprise, try to 
kill one or both before they can react (risky solo, but you're strong)
3.	Try to bypass them - Your 60 ft swim speed might let you blast past 
before they can react (risky, leaves them at your back)
4.	Draw them back to the party - Attack, then retreat, pulling them 
into a prepared ambush where Cyrus and team are waiting (clever but 
requires precise timing)
5.	Something else?
Current status:
*	You're 30 feet from the entrance (where party is)
*	Grick #1 is in the alcove right next to you (5 feet away)
*	Grick #2 is at the 40-foot mark
*	You're undetected (Stealth 22 holding)
*	Hex is available to cast
*	Full spell slots and abilities
Time elapsed: ~3 minutes (Cyrus has 7 minutes left on his ritual)
What do you do?
Hex closest grick, then EB
Dec 10
AMBUSH THE AMBUSHERS
You hover silently in the murky water, focusing on the grick coiled in the 
alcove just five feet away. It has no idea you're there-its stone-gray hide 
blends with the carved walls, tentacles tucked, waiting for prey that will never 
come.
Dark energy coils around the creature as you cast Hex. The curse settles over 
it like a shroud.
Then you unleash Eldritch Blast.
 
SURPRISE ROUND - JOHANNES ATTACKS
Eldritch Blast (2 beams at Hexed Grick #1, target surprised):
The water around you crackles with dark purple-black energy as twin beams 
lance through the murk-HISS-CRACK, HISS-CRACK-each one leaving a 
trail of bubbles.
First beam:
*	Attack roll: 15 + 7 = 22 (Hit, automatic crit on surprised target)
*	Damage: (1d10+4)×2 (EB crit) + 1d6 (Hex) = (8+4)×2 + 3 = 24 + 3 = 
27 damage
Second beam:
*	Attack roll: 18 + 7 = 25 (Hit, automatic crit on surprised target)
*	Damage: (1d10+4)×2 (EB crit) + 1d6 (Hex) = (6+4)×2 + 5 = 20 + 5 = 
25 damage
Total: 52 damage
The twin beams obliterate the ambushing grick. The first beam punches 
completely through its midsection, the second tears through what passes for 
its head. Dark ichor explodes into the water in a cloud.
The creature doesn't even have time to register pain. It's dead instantly, body 
already drifting in the current.
Grick #1: DEAD
 
GRICK #2 REACTS
The second grick, positioned at the upward angle 35 feet away, immediately 
detects the attack-the sound of crackling energy, the sudden cloud of 
ichor, the vibrations through the water.
It turns toward you, tentacles extending aggressively. It can't see you clearly 
through the murky water and settling ichor cloud, but it 
knows something killed its companion.
INITIATIVE:
*	Johannes (Trident advantage): 20 + 3 = 23
*	Grick #2: 11 + 0 = 11
You're faster. It's swimming toward you but hasn't reached you yet.
 
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN
The grick is now about 30 feet away, closing fast. You can see its tentacled 
maw opening, ready to strike.
You transfer your Hex from the dead grick to this one. Dark energy shifts 
instantly.
Then you fire again.
Eldritch Blast (2 beams at Hexed Grick #2):
First beam:
*	Attack roll: 13 + 7 = 20 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 7 + 4 + 4 = 15 damage
Second beam:
*	Attack roll: 16 + 7 = 23 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 9 + 4 + 2 = 15 damage
Total: 30 damage
Both beams strike true, punching holes through the grick's rubbery hide. It 
shrieks-a horrible wet sound that echoes through the water-and recoils, 
badly wounded but still alive.
 
GRICK #2'S TURN
Wounded and desperate, the grick lunges forward, closing the remaining 
distance. Its tentacles lash out at you.
Tentacle Attack:
*	Attack roll: 14 + 4 = 18 vs your AC 16
*	HIT
*	Damage: 2d6+2 = 8 + 2 = 10 damage
The tentacles wrap around your left arm and shoulder, yanking you closer to 
its beaked maw. You feel the constriction, the strength of the creature trying to 
pull you in.
Grapple attempt (contested STR):
*	Grick STR: 14 + 2 = 16
*	Your STR: 10 + 0 = 10
*	You are GRAPPLED
The creature has you. Its beak is snapping toward your face, tentacles 
tightening.
Your HP: 76 - 10 = 66 HP remaining
 
ROUND 2 - JOHANNES'S TURN
You're grappled, underwater, face-to-face with a wounded, desperate grick 
trying to bite your head off.
Options:
1.	Point-blank Eldritch Blast (you can still cast while grappled, 
disadvantage on attacks isn't a thing for ranged spell attacks while 
grappled, just movement is restricted)
2.	Stab with Trident (melee attack, you're in perfect range, +1 magical 
weapon bypasses resistance)
3.	Try to break grapple (Athletics or Acrobatics check vs the grick's 
Athletics)
4.	Dimension Door scroll (emergency escape, but probably overkill)
5.	Something else?
The grick's beak is inches from your face. Its grip is tight. But it's also badly 
wounded-one good hit should finish it.
What do you do?
2
Dec 10
TRIDENT STRIKE - POINT BLANK
Grappled, face-to-face with the grick's snapping beak, you shift your grip on 
the Trident of Warning and thrust directly into the creature's center mass.
Trident Attack (+1 magical weapon):
*	Attack roll: 14 + 7 (STR + proficiency + magical bonus) = 21 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d6+1 (trident magical) + 3 (STR) = 5 + 1 + 3 = 9 damage
The trident punches through the grick's rubbery hide with a wet THUNK, 
driving deep into its body. You feel the resistance, then the give as the weapon 
finds vital organs (or whatever passes for them in an aberration).
The grick convulses violently. Its tentacles spasm, grip loosening. The beak 
snaps once more-weakly, reflexively-then goes still.
Grick #2: DEAD
The creature's body goes limp, tentacles unwrapping from your arm. Dark 
ichor clouds the water around you as it drifts downward, settling on the silt-
covered floor.
 
AFTERMATH - UNDERWATER CHAMBER
You float in the murky water, breathing easily thanks to the Cloak, surrounded 
by settling ichor and sediment. Both gricks are dead. The ambush that would 
have caught your companions has been completely neutralized.
Combat Summary:
*	Duration: ~12 seconds (2 rounds)
*	Damage taken: 10 HP (66/76 remaining)
*	Resources used: Hex (still active, can be moved), 4 Eldritch Blast 
beams (cantrip), 1 melee attack
*	Result: Complete tactical success
Your Trident of Warning's magic pulses once-confirming no additional 
immediate threats nearby.
 
SCOUTING THE FAR CHAMBER
With the threats eliminated, you swim forward through the passage, ascending 
the angled section where Grick #2 had been positioned.
You break the surface.
The Administrative Level - Dry Chamber:
The passage emerges into a chamber that is indeed mostly dry, just as Thordin 
predicted. Water fills the lower 3-4 feet, but above that is open air-stale, 
damp, but breathable.
What you see:
The chamber is roughly 40 feet across, with a vaulted ceiling about 
20 feet high. Carved pillars support the roof. The architecture is distinctly 
administrative-desks (long since rotted), filing cabinets (rusted and fallen), 
what might have been a reception area.
Three doorways lead out:
*	Left: A corridor heading deeper into the administrative section (dark, 
unknown)
*	Center: Larger double doors, partially ajar, with dwarven runes above 
them reading "COMMANDER'S VAULT" (your destination!)
*	Right: Another corridor, collapsed about 20 feet in (blocked)
Additional observations:
Bioluminescent fungi grows along the walls and ceiling, providing dim 
blue-green light. It's beautiful in an eerie way-enough to see by, even without 
your Devil's Sight.
No immediate threats. The chamber appears empty. No gricks, no other 
creatures visible.
Signs of age: Everything is ancient, decayed, untouched for centuries. The 
water line on the walls shows the flooding is stable-it's been at this level for a 
very long time.
The Commander's Vault doors: Heavy bronze, weathered but intact. 
They're slightly open-maybe a foot gap. You can't see inside from your 
current position.
 
DECISION POINT
You've completed your scout. The intelligence is valuable:
Confirmed:
*	Two gricks were waiting in ambush (now dead)
*	The passage is clear
*	The far chamber is accessible and mostly dry
*	The Commander's Vault is here and appears accessible
*	No other immediate threats visible
Time check: You've been gone about 6-7 minutes. Cyrus has maybe 3-4 
minutes left on his Water Breathing ritual.
Your options:
1.	Return to the party now - Report findings, bring everyone through 
together once ritual completes (safest, coordinated approach)
2.	Wait here for 3-4 minutes - Let Cyrus finish the ritual, then guide 
them through when they arrive (maintains forward position)
3.	Investigate the Vault while waiting - You're here, the doors are 
open, you could peek inside (risky-what if there's a trap or guardian?)
4.	Check the left corridor quickly - Make sure there are no additional 
threats before bringing the party through (thorough but uses time)
5.	Something else?
The fungi-lit chamber is quiet except for the gentle lap of water against stone. 
The Vault doors stand slightly ajar, waiting.
What do you do?

Dec 10
RETURN TO THE PARTY
You've got the intel you came for. No need to push your luck solo-better to 
bring the team through and tackle the Vault together.
You take one last look around the chamber, committing the layout to memory: 
three exits, the Vault doors in the center, fungi providing light, water line 
stable at 3-4 feet.
Then you descend back into the flooded passage.
 
THE SWIM BACK
Swimming back through the passage is quick and uneventful. The two dead 
gricks drift in the current, ichor still clouding the water slightly, but they pose 
no threat now.
You cover the 40 feet in seconds, ascending the 12-foot rise, and break the 
surface at the entrance where you left your companions.
 
REUNION - REPORT
"Johannes!" Kessa calls out as you emerge, relief evident in her 
voice. "You're back. Everything alright?"
Cyrus is still seated cross-legged, hands folded, eyes closed-deep in the final 
stages of the ritual. His voice continues in a steady, rhythmic chant. Divine 
magic pulses faintly in the air around him.
Thordin offers you a hand up onto the dry stone ledge. "What did you 
find?"
You pull yourself out of the water, dripping. "Two gricks waiting in 
ambush-one in an alcove halfway through, one at the far end. I 
eliminated both. Passage is clear now."
Kessa's eyebrows raise. "You took out two gricks solo?"
"Surprise helped. First one never knew I was there. Second one got 
a hit in but went down fast." You touch your shoulder where the tentacles 
wrapped-it's bruised but not serious. "Ten damage, nothing critical."
Thordin grins broadly. "Well done! That saves us a nasty fight in 
confined space. What about the far side?"
"Exactly as you described-dry chamber, about three to four feet of 
standing water, but breathable air above. Three exits: left corridor 
into the administrative section, center is the Commander's Vault 
with doors partially open, right corridor is collapsed and blocked."
You describe the layout in detail-the fungi lighting, the apparent lack of 
additional threats, the bronze vault doors.
"No other gricks visible?" Thordin asks carefully.
"None that I could see. But there are other passages leading 
deeper. I didn't explore those-figured we should go together."
Thordin nods approvingly. "Smart. Never split the party more than 
necessary."
 
WATER BREATHING RITUAL COMPLETES
Cyrus opens his eyes and releases a long breath. The divine magic that had 
been building around him for the past ten minutes settles into place.
"The spell is ready," he announces, standing and stretching. "I can grant 
water breathing to all four of us for the next eight hours."
He moves to each of you in turn, touching shoulders and speaking brief 
prayers. You feel the magic settle over you-a cool, fluid sensation, like the 
water itself is welcoming you.
Water Breathing active on entire party (8 hours duration).
Cyrus looks at you. "You said you cleared the ambush? Well done. 
How are you feeling? Need healing?"
"I'm fine," you assure him. "Just some bruising. Save your magic for 
real emergencies."
 
CROSSING AS A GROUP
With Water Breathing active, the crossing becomes trivial:
"Stay together," you instruct as the group prepares to enter the 
water. "Follow my lead. The passage is straight for forty feet, then 
angles up. The two dead gricks are in there-don't be startled. We'll 
surface in the administrative chamber."
Everyone nods, checking weapons and equipment one last time.
Thordin: Warhammer ready, pack secured, moving with the confidence of 
someone who's done this before.
Kessa: Hand crossbow loaded, daggers accessible, moving with professional 
efficiency.
Cyrus: Holy symbol around his neck, goggles on for darkvision, looking 
focused and ready.
You lead the way into the dark water.
 
THE PASSAGE - GROUP CROSSING
The four of you descend and swim through together. With everyone able to 
breathe water freely, there's no panic, no rushing. It's almost peaceful-like 
exploring rather than infiltrating.
Kessa notes the dead gricks as you pass, giving you an impressed look. 
The evidence of your work is clear-massive holes punched through their 
bodies, ichor still settling.
Thordin examines the alcove ambush position, nodding in 
professional respect. "Good eyes, spotting that. Would've been nasty if 
we'd swum past without noticing."
The swim takes less than a minute. You ascend the angled passage and break 
the surface into the fungi-lit administrative chamber.
 
THE ADMINISTRATIVE LEVEL - FULL PARTY 
ARRIVAL
Everyone pulls themselves up onto the higher stone ledges above the water 
line (the chamber has about 3-4 feet of water covering the floor, but the desks 
and raised platforms are dry enough to stand on).
Thordin looks around with satisfaction, water dripping from his 
beard. "Just as I remember it. Well, a bit more decayed, but the 
bones are the same."
He points to the center doors-the Commander's Vault. "That's our target. 
The Helm of Kharas should be inside, probably in a display case or 
secure chest."
Kessa is already scanning for threats, her crossbow ready, eyes moving 
systematically across the chamber. "Left corridor-anything down there 
we need to worry about?"
"Didn't scout it," you admit. "Could be more gricks, could be clear. 
The Vault seemed like priority."
Cyrus moves to the Vault doors, examining them carefully. "These runes... 
they're protective wards. Very old, but still active. See the faint 
glow?"
He's right-there's a barely perceptible shimmer around the door frame. 
Magic that's endured three centuries.
Thordin nods. "Aye. The Commander wouldn't leave his treasures 
unguarded. The wards are probably keyed to dwarven blood or 
specific command words. But with time and patience, we can work 
around them."
He looks at the group. "Question is: do we secure the chamber first-
check that left corridor, make sure nothing's going to ambush us 
from behind-or do we go straight for the Vault?"
 
What's your priority?
1.	Clear the left corridor first (secure your position, eliminate threats 
before focusing on the Vault)
2.	Go straight to the Vault (that's why you're here, deal with threats if 
they emerge)
3.	Split up (some guard, some work on Vault-efficient but risky)
4.	Set watch while examining Vault (compromise-Kessa and 
Thordin on overwatch, you and Cyrus tackle the door)
5.	Something else?
The fungi-lit chamber waits, quiet except for the gentle lap of water. The Vault 
doors stand slightly ajar, promising treasure-and possibly danger.

Dec 10
SECURING THE PERIMETER
"We clear the corridor first," you decide firmly. "Last thing we need is 
gricks or something worse coming up behind us while we're 
focused on the Vault. We do this properly-secure the area, then 
retrieve the Helm."
Thordin nods approvingly. "Professional. I like it. Better to spend ten 
minutes clearing threats than ten seconds dying to an ambush."
Cyrus hefts his mace. "Agreed. Let's make sure we're alone down 
here."
Kessa is already moving toward the left corridor, crossbow raised. "I'll take 
point. Standard sweep formation?"
"Standard sweep," you confirm. "Kessa front, I'm right behind her, 
Cyrus and Thordin cover our flanks and rear. Call out anything 
suspicious."
 
THE LEFT CORRIDOR - INVESTIGATION
The corridor extends into darkness-your various vision enhancements 
(Devil's Sight, Goggles of Night, dwarven darkvision for Thordin) make 
navigation easy despite the lack of light.
The passage is carved stone, about 8 feet wide, 10 feet tall. Water 
covers the floor to about ankle-depth here (the administrative level slopes 
slightly). Side doors branch off-offices, storage rooms, perhaps living 
quarters for senior staff.
Kessa moves carefully, checking every doorway, every shadow.
Perception checks (group):
*	Johannes: 15 + 3 = 18
*	Kessa: Natural 20 + 7 = 27 (Exceptional)
*	Cyrus: 13 + 4 = 17
*	Thordin: 16 + 5 = 21
 
WHAT KESSA DISCOVERS
"Hold," Kessa whispers sharply, raising her fist. Everyone freezes.
She points to a doorway about 30 feet ahead on the right. "Movement. 
Something large. Breathing-I can hear it."
You listen carefully. She's right-there's a wet, rhythmic sound. Something 
alive. Something big.
Thordin whispers: "How big?"
Kessa considers. "Bigger than the gricks. Maybe... eight feet? Ten?"
Your Trident of Warning begins to tingle-not urgent alarm, but definite 
warning. Danger ahead.
 
TACTICAL APPROACH
The creature (whatever it is) is in a side room, apparently unaware of your 
presence. The door is partially open-maybe 2 feet gap.
Options:
1.	Ambush from doorway (position team, strike fast when you have 
surprise)
2.	Kessa scouts alone (she's stealthiest, can get eyes on target before 
committing)
3.	Announce presence (call out, give it a chance to respond-might not 
be hostile?)
4.	Bypass entirely (close/bar the door, deal with Vault, handle this on 
the way out)
5.	Something else?
Thordin whispers: "Could be a grick alpha-larger, tougher version. 
Could be something else that moved in after the Cataclysm. Your 
call, Commander."
Kessa adds quietly: "Whatever it is, it's between us and a clear exit. I 
vote we deal with it now."
What's your approach?
1
Dec 10
AMBUSH SETUP
"We hit it hard and fast," you whisper. "Ambush from the doorway. 
Kessa, can you see inside without alerting it?"
Kessa nods, already moving silently toward the partially open door. She 
positions herself at the edge, peering through the gap with professional care.
After a moment, she signals back with hand signs:
One creature. Large. Grick-like but bigger. Coiled. Sleeping or resting.
Thordin whispers: "Grick alpha. Tougher hide, more hit points, 
nastier bite. But if it's resting, we've got the advantage."
"Positions," you whisper. "Kessa, open the door on my mark and 
take the first shot. I'll hit it with Hex and Eldritch Blast. Cyrus, 
Sacred Flame. Thordin, be ready to charge if it survives the 
opening salvo."
Everyone nods, moving into position with practiced efficiency.
Kessa: At the door, hand on the handle, crossbow ready in the other 
hand. Johannes: Behind her, clear line of sight once the door 
opens. Cyrus: To the side, holy symbol ready. Thordin: Warhammer 
gripped, prepared to rush in.
You take a breath, focus on the door, prepare your Hex.
"Three... two... one... MARK."
 
SURPRISE ROUND - GRICK ALPHA AMBUSH
Kessa kicks the door fully open with a bang, her crossbow already raised.
Inside the room-a grick alpha. It's massive compared to the regular gricks, 
easily 12 feet long, thick as a barrel, coiled in the center of what was once an 
administrative office. It was indeed resting, but the door crash wakes it 
instantly.
Its tentacled head whips around, eyes (or sensory organs) focusing on the 
doorway-
Too late.
 
KESSA'S ATTACK (Surprise Round)
Hand Crossbow + Sneak Attack:
*	Attack roll: 18 + 7 = 25 (Hit, target surprised)
*	Damage: 1d6+4 + 3d6 (sneak attack) = 5 + 4 + 14 = 23 damage
The bolt punches into the grick alpha's body with a meaty thunk. The creature 
shrieks-a deep, resonant sound that echoes through the corridors.
 
JOHANNES'S ATTACK (Surprise Round)
You cast Hex on the creature as it rears up, dark energy coiling around it. 
Then you unleash Eldritch Blast.
Two beams (target surprised):
First beam:
*	Attack roll: 14 + 7 = 21 (Hit, auto-crit)
*	Damage: (1d10+4)×2 + 1d6 (Hex) = (7+4)×2 + 3 = 22 + 3 = 25 
damage
Second beam:
*	Attack roll: 16 + 7 = 23 (Hit, auto-crit)
*	Damage: (1d10+4)×2 + 1d6 (Hex) = (9+4)×2 + 4 = 26 + 4 = 30 
damage
Total: 55 damage
The twin beams of crackling energy HISS-CRACK through the doorway, 
slamming into the grick alpha's body. Massive holes tear through its rubbery 
hide, ichor spraying across the walls.
The creature roars in pain and fury, but it's still standing-these things 
are tough.
 
CYRUS'S ATTACK (Surprise Round)
"BURN!" Cyrus shouts, thrusting his holy symbol forward.
Sacred Flame (DEX save DC 15):
*	Grick Alpha DEX save: 6 + 1 = 7 (FAIL)
*	Damage: 2d8 radiant = 15 damage
Holy fire descends from above, engulfing the wounded grick alpha. Its hide 
blackens and blisters under the radiant assault.
Total damage in surprise round: 23 + 55 + 15 = 93 damage
The grick alpha is heavily wounded, ichor pouring from multiple wounds, 
burned by holy fire, but it's not dead yet. It thrashes violently, tentacles 
lashing, preparing to fight back.
 
INITIATIVE - ROUND 1
Roll Initiative:
*	Johannes (Trident advantage): 21 + 3 = 24
*	Kessa: 17 + 5 = 22
*	Cyrus: 15 + 2 = 17
*	Thordin: 13 + 2 = 15
*	Grick Alpha: 9 + 1 = 10
The grick alpha is desperate, wounded, and furious. But you're all faster.
 
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN
The creature is badly wounded but still dangerous. Its tentacles are extending 
toward the doorway, and its beak is snapping.
What do you do?
1.	Eldritch Blast again (finish it from range, 2 more beams with Hex 
active)
2.	Maddening Hex (bonus action, 4 psychic damage + make it harder for 
it to act)
3.	Move into melee with Trident (aggressive, but why close when you 
have range?)
4.	Something else?
The grick alpha is maybe 15 feet away from the doorway, coiled but preparing 
to strike.
Your turn.
1
Dec 10
FINISHING BLOW - ELDRITCH BLAST
No need to get fancy. The creature is heavily wounded, and you have the range 
advantage.
You raise your hand and unleash another barrage of eldritch energy.
Eldritch Blast (2 beams at Hexed Grick Alpha):
First beam:
*	Attack roll: 12 + 7 = 19 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 8 + 4 + 5 = 17 damage
Second beam:
*	Attack roll: 15 + 7 = 22 (Hit)
*	Damage: 1d10+4 (EB) + 1d6 (Hex) = 6 + 4 + 2 = 12 damage
Total: 29 damage
The twin beams CRACK-HISS through the doorway, punching into the grick 
alpha's already-ravaged body. The first beam tears through its midsection, the 
second strikes where body meets tentacled head.
The massive creature shudders violently, tentacles spasming, then-
It collapses.
The grick alpha crashes to the stone floor with a heavy THUD, ichor pooling 
rapidly around it. Its tentacles twitch once, twice, then go still.
Grick Alpha: DEAD
 
AFTERMATH - SECURING THE CORRIDOR
Silence falls over the corridor, broken only by the drip of water and your 
breathing.
Thordin steps forward cautiously, warhammer ready, and prods the corpse 
with his boot. It doesn't move.
"Dead," he confirms. "That was a grick alpha alright. Nasty piece of 
work. They're usually the colony leaders-tougher, meaner, 
smarter than the regular ones."
He looks at the group with genuine respect. "You lot took it down in one 
round of actual combat. That's... impressive. Very impressive."
Kessa is already reloading her crossbow. "Good ambush. Caught it 
completely off-guard." She looks at you. "Your opening strike 
basically crippled it before it could respond."
Cyrus examines the room briefly. "This was some kind of record-
keeping office. The alpha probably moved in because it's a large, 
secure space." He checks the corners and alcoves. "Looks clear 
otherwise."
 
CONTINUING THE SWEEP
You proceed down the corridor, checking the remaining rooms systematically:
Rooms found:
*	Storage chamber: Empty, some rotted furniture, nothing of interest
*	Office: Similar to the alpha's lair, abandoned for centuries
*	Small armory: Rusted weapons, corroded armor, nothing salvageable
*	Quarters: Personal rooms for administrators, long since decayed
The corridor ends at a collapsed section about 60 feet from where you 
started. Stone has caved in, completely blocking further passage. There's no 
way through without major excavation.
"Dead end," Kessa confirms. "Nothing else down here."
Thordin nods. "Good. That means the entire administrative level is 
secure except for the Vault itself. No more threats at our backs."
 
COMBAT SUMMARY - CORRIDOR SWEEP
Encounters eliminated:
*	2 gricks (underwater passage, solo)
*	1 grick alpha (administrative corridor, group)
Party status:
*	Johannes: 66/76 HP (10 damage from earlier grick)
*	Kessa: Full HP
*	Cyrus: Full HP
*	Thordin: Full HP
Resources used:
*	Hex (still active, can be moved or dismissed)
*	Multiple Eldritch Blasts (cantrips, unlimited)
*	1 Sacred Flame (cantrip, unlimited)
*	1 crossbow bolt (Kessa)
*	Water Breathing (ongoing, 7+ hours remaining)
Tactical assessment: Perfect execution on both fronts. Area secured with 
minimal resource expenditure.
 
RETURNING TO THE VAULT
The four of you return to the main chamber where the Commander's Vault 
awaits. The bronze doors stand slightly ajar, the ancient protective wards still 
shimmering faintly in your various vision modes.
Thordin approaches the doors carefully, examining them with a professional 
eye.
"Right. Now for the tricky part." He traces the runes with his finger, not 
quite touching. "These wards are designed to prevent forced entry. If 
we just push the doors open or try to break in, they'll trigger-
probably a shock, maybe an alarm, possibly something worse."
He strokes his beard thoughtfully. "The wards are old, though. Three 
centuries old. They're still active, but weakened. With the right 
approach, we might be able to bypass or disable them."
Cyrus steps forward. "I might be able to dispel the magic, or at least 
suppress it temporarily. Divine magic versus arcane wards-it's not 
guaranteed, but it's possible."
Kessa adds: "Or I could try to pick the lock mechanism directly, if 
there is one. Sometimes the physical lock is separate from the 
magical protections."
Thordin considers both options. "The dispel is safer but might fail. 
The lockpicking is riskier-if you trigger the wards, we all feel it. 
But if it works, we're in clean."
He looks at you. "Your call, Commander. You've led us this far 
without a misstep."
 
How do you want to handle the Vault doors?
1.	Cyrus attempts to Dispel Magic (ritual cast if needed, takes 10 
minutes but safer)
2.	Kessa picks the lock (faster but riskier if wards trigger)
3.	Thordin tries a dwarven command word (he knows some 
traditional phrases, might work)
4.	Examine the doors more thoroughly first (take your time, gather 
more info before deciding)
5.	Brute force (just push through and accept the consequences-not 
recommended)
6.	Something else?
The Vault doors wait, three centuries of protection still active, the Helm of 
Kharas presumably just beyond.
What's your approach?
4, then 3, then 1, then 2
Dec 10
METHODICAL APPROACH - VAULT DOORS
"We do this carefully," you say. "No rushing. We examine the doors 
thoroughly first, then try solutions in order of risk. Thordin's 
dwarven command words first since he knows the culture, then 
Cyrus's Dispel Magic, then Kessa's lockpicking if needed."
Everyone nods-it's a sensible, methodical approach.
"Let's start with a full examination. Everyone, look for anything 
unusual."
 
PHASE 1: THOROUGH EXAMINATION
The four of you spread out around the doors, examining them from every 
angle.
Investigation/Perception Checks:
*	Johannes: 16 + 3 = 19
*	Kessa: 18 + 7 = 25 (Excellent)
*	Cyrus (Arcana for magical elements): 17 + 4 = 21
*	Thordin (History/dwarven knowledge): Natural 20 + 5 
= 25 (Exceptional)
 
WHAT YOU DISCOVER:
Thordin (critical success) finds the key details:
"Ah! Here!" he exclaims, pointing to a section of runes near the door 
handle. "I know this pattern. This is a ward of lineage-it's keyed to 
dwarven blood, specifically to the Thoradin clan. But look here..."** He traces 
another set of runes. "There's an override phrase. A formal request 
protocol."
He grins. "The Commander wasn't just trying to keep thieves out-he 
was trying to keep unauthorized DWARVES out. This is military 
security, not tomb protection. There's a proper way to request 
entry."
 
Kessa's observations:
"The physical lock is integrated with the magical wards," she notes, 
examining the mechanism. "You can't pick one without triggering the 
other. But the good news is the lock itself is simple-it's the wards 
doing the heavy lifting, not complex tumblers."
She points to stress cracks around the door frame. "The doors have been 
slightly forced open at some point-see the gap? Someone or 
something pushed them partially open, but the wards stopped 
them from going further. That's why they're ajar now."
 
Cyrus's magical analysis:
"The wards are evocation-based," he explains. "Designed to deliver a 
shock-probably lightning or force damage-to anyone trying to 
force entry. The good news is they're significantly weakened after 
three centuries. I'd estimate maybe 4d6 damage instead of the 
original 8d6 or higher."
He studies the magical pattern. "Dispel Magic would work, but it's not 
guaranteed. The ward was cast at high level originally. I'd say... 
60% chance of success with a standard casting, maybe 80% if I 
ritual cast and take my time."
 
Your observations:
You notice the doors themselves are bronze-reinforced oak-incredibly 
durable. The hinges are dwarven engineering, still functional after centuries. 
The gap between the doors is about 8-10 inches-you can see darkness 
beyond, but not details.
More importantly, your Trident of Warning is not tingling. Whatever's 
inside the Vault, it's not an active threat waiting to ambush you.
 
PHASE 2: DWARVEN COMMAND WORD
"I'm going to try the formal request protocol," Thordin 
announces. "It's a long shot-I'm not Thoradin clan, and the 
Commander's been dead for centuries. But the wards might still 
recognize proper military procedure."
He straightens, adopts a formal military posture, and speaks in clear, resonant 
Dwarven:
"Commander Thoradin, I am Thordin Ironhelm, Master Delver of 
Thorbardin. I request entry to retrieve artifacts of our people on 
behalf of the living clans. I invoke the Right of Recovery under the 
Accords of Stone and Steel. Grant me passage."
 
The wards flare briefly-blue light racing along the runes.
For a moment, everyone tenses, ready for a blast of magical energy-
But then the light softens, turning from aggressive blue to a gentler amber.
The runes rearrange slightly, and ancient magical mechanisms click inside 
the doors.
The wards don't fully deactivate, but they... recognize the request.
A spectral voice-deep, authoritative, clearly dwarven-echoes from the doors:
"REQUEST ACKNOWLEDGED. LINEAGE VERIFICATION... 
FAILED. CLAN AFFILIATION... THORBARDIN, RECOGNIZED. 
PURPOSE... ARTIFACT RECOVERY, ACCEPTABLE."
A pause, then:
"CONDITIONAL ENTRY GRANTED. RESTRICTIONS: NO THEFT 
OF SACRED ITEMS. NO DESECRATION. TIME LIMIT: ONE HOUR. 
VIOLATE TERMS, WARDS ACTIVATE."
The doors swing open smoothly, revealing the darkened Vault beyond.
 
Thordin's jaw drops. "By the Forge... it actually WORKED. The 
ward recognized Thorbardin lineage and the formal protocol. It's 
treating us as legitimate military personnel on authorized 
business."
He looks at the group with a mixture of awe and relief. "We have one hour 
inside. We can take artifacts, but if we desecrate anything or steal 
sacred items, the wards will attack. The Helm of Kharas isn't 
sacred in the religious sense-it's historical. We should be fine."
Kessa grins. "So we just walked into a three-century-old vault by 
asking politely. I love it when the ancient security assumes good 
faith."
Cyrus looks thoughtful. "The dwarves who built this place never 
imagined it would be abandoned for centuries. They built it to keep 
out unauthorized access, not to seal it forever."
 
THE COMMANDER'S VAULT - INTERIOR
You step through the open doors into the Vault.
The chamber is roughly 30 feet by 30 feet, with a vaulted 
ceiling. Unlike the rest of the complex, this room is completely dry-the 
wards have kept water out entirely.
What you see:
Display cases line the walls, made of reinforced glass (or possibly crystal). 
Most are empty or contain items that have decayed (cloth, leather, documents 
turned to dust).
But some items remain intact:
*	A ceremonial warhammer in pristine condition, mounted on the far 
wall
*	Several pieces of jewelry in a case-rings, amulets, pins
*	A shield bearing the symbol of Thoradin's Hall
*	Documents in sealed crystal tubes-maps, orders, personal letters, 
all preserved
*	And on a central pedestal, illuminated by faint magical light:
The Helm of Kharas.
It's magnificent. Dwarven craftsmanship at its finest-steel worked with gold 
inlay, runes of protection and honor etched along the brow, wings extending 
from the sides in traditional dwarven style. It's slightly dust-covered but 
otherwise perfect, as if it was placed here yesterday rather than 280 years 
ago.
Thordin approaches it reverently, removing his own helmet. "There it is. 
The Helm of Kharas. One of the greatest artifacts of our people."
He doesn't touch it immediately-just stands, looking at it with profound 
respect.
 
The chamber is as you were told: one hour time limit, no 
desecration, artifact recovery is permitted.
What do you do?
1.	Thordin retrieves the Helm (that's what you came for)
2.	Examine other items (the warhammer, jewelry, documents-
anything else valuable?)
3.	Document everything (record what's here before taking anything)
4.	Take only the Helm and leave quickly (minimize time in the Vault)
5.	Something else?
You have one hour before the wards reactivate.
The items here are abandoned, right?
Dec 10
CLARIFYING THE SITUATION
Good question. You turn to Thordin for his assessment.
"These items-they're abandoned, right? No one's been here in 
centuries. No one's coming back for them."
Thordin considers carefully, his expression thoughtful.
"Technically, yes and no," he says slowly. "The outpost was 
abandoned during the Cataclysm-everyone either died or fled. For 
280 years, this place has been empty. No one from Thoradin's line 
survived to claim inheritance. No one from Thoradin's Hall ever 
returned."
He gestures to the Vault. "But dwarven law is complicated. These items 
belonged to the outpost, to Clan Thoradin, to the dwarven people 
as a whole. The Helm specifically was a ceremonial gift-it has 
historical and cultural significance."
"So taking them would be...?" Kessa prompts.
"Legally ambiguous," Thordin admits. "From one perspective, we're 
recovering lost artifacts of our people-that's legitimate salvage, 
especially since I'm a dwarf of Thorbardin acting in good faith. The 
ward recognized that and granted conditional entry."
"From another perspective," he continues, "some dwarven clans 
might argue these items should be returned to Thorbardin, to the 
appropriate authorities, not sold to private collectors or kept as 
personal loot."
He looks at the Helm, then at the other items.
"Here's what I know for certain: The Helm is my contract. I'm 
taking it to my client in Palanthas as agreed-that's legitimate 
artifact recovery, and I'm paying you for your help. That's clean."
"As for the other items..." He pauses. "The ward said 'no theft of 
sacred items.' The ceremonial warhammer might count as sacred-
it's a religious symbol. The documents are historical records, not 
sacred. The jewelry... probably personal effects, not sacred."
"The ward will judge based on intent and action. If we're taking 
items for preservation, recovery, or legitimate use-probably fine. 
If we're looting and desecrating-the wards will attack."
 
Cyrus offers his perspective:
"From a moral standpoint, these items have been abandoned for 
nearly three centuries. No one is coming back for them. Leaving 
them here means they'll eventually decay or be lost forever. Taking 
them-especially to preserve them or return them to dwarven 
hands-seems more respectful than leaving them to rot."
He looks at the documents in crystal tubes. "Those historical records, for 
instance, could be invaluable to historians and dwarven clans 
trying to understand what happened during the Cataclysm. Leaving 
them here serves no one."
 
Kessa's practical take:
"Look, we have an hour. We came for the Helm, that's priority one. 
If there are other items that are valuable, non-sacred, and serve a 
purpose being recovered-we take them. If the wards object, we'll 
know immediately and we stop."
She grins slightly. "Besides, the ward specifically said 'no theft of 
sacred items.' It didn't say 'don't touch anything else.'"
 
Thordin's final assessment:
"Here's my recommendation: We take the Helm-that's the 
mission. We take the historical documents-they're records, not 
treasure, and they belong in archives where people can learn from 
them. The jewelry and personal effects... we could take them and 
donate them to Thorbardin's museum or historical society. That's 
preservation, not theft."
"The ceremonial warhammer, though-I'd leave that. It's explicitly 
religious/ceremonial. Taking it feels like crossing the 'sacred items' 
line."
He looks at you. "But you're the commander. What's your call?"
 
So to summarize:
Definitely take:
*	Helm of Kharas (mission objective)
Probably safe to take:
*	Historical documents in crystal tubes (preservation/scholarship)
*	Personal jewelry/effects (can be donated to museums or dwarven 
authorities)
*	The shield with Thoradin's Hall symbol (historical artifact)
Should NOT take:
*	Ceremonial warhammer (likely counts as "sacred item")
The ward will judge based on intent. If you're taking items 
respectfully for preservation/recovery, you're probably fine. If 
you're looting greedily, the wards will activate.
What do you want to do?
Take what is safe, leave the rest
Dec 10
RESPECTFUL RECOVERY
"We take what's safe and appropriate," you decide. "The Helm is our 
mission. The documents and historical artifacts should be 
preserved-they're records of your people's history. The jewelry 
can go to Thorbardin's museums or historical societies. But we 
leave the ceremonial warhammer. That crosses the line into sacred 
items."
Thordin nods with clear approval. "A wise and respectful choice. Let's 
work quickly."
 
ARTIFACT RECOVERY - 15 MINUTES
The team moves efficiently through the Vault:
Thordin - The Helm of Kharas
Thordin approaches the central pedestal reverently. He speaks quietly in 
Dwarven-a prayer or acknowledgment-then carefully lifts the Helm.
The wards flicker briefly-everyone tenses-but then settle to their 
ambient glow. The ward is assessing but not objecting.
Thordin wraps the Helm carefully in protective cloth and places it in his 
pack. "Mission objective secured."
 
Cyrus - Historical Documents
Cyrus gathers the sealed crystal tubes containing preserved documents. There 
are six of them, each containing rolled parchments-maps, military orders, 
personal correspondence, administrative records.
"These are invaluable," he says reverently. "Primary sources from 
before the Cataclysm. Historians will treasure these."
The wards remain calm. Historical preservation is clearly acceptable.
 
Kessa - Jewelry and Personal Effects
Kessa carefully removes jewelry from the display case:
*	3 rings (gold, possibly magical based on faint auras)
*	2 amulets (silver, one with a gemstone)
*	4 decorative pins (military rank insignia, historical value)
"These belonged to officers and administrators," she 
notes. "Personal effects, not religious items. Should be fine."
The wards continue their ambient shimmer. No objection.
 
Johannes - The Shield
You lift the shield bearing Thoradin's Hall's symbol from its mount. It's well-
crafted, ceremonial but functional, bearing the outpost's heraldry.
"Historical artifact," you say aloud, half to the wards, half to your 
companions. "Preserving this honors those who served here."
The wards pulse once-acknowledgment, not alarm.
 
Items LEFT Behind (Deliberately)
The ceremonial warhammer remains mounted on the far wall. Everyone 
gives it respectful distance. It's clearly a religious symbol, and taking it would 
violate the ward's terms.
Several other items that have decayed beyond recovery-rotted leather, 
corroded metal, documents turned to dust-are left undisturbed.
 
FINAL ASSESSMENT - 20 MINUTES ELAPSED
The four of you stand near the entrance, packs secured with recovered items.
Thordin does a final check: "Helm of Kharas, six document tubes, 
shield, jewelry and insignia. All non-sacred items, all recovered 
respectfully for preservation and historical purposes."
The wards remain stable-ambient glow, no hostile reaction. The ancient 
magic judges your actions acceptable.
Cyrus says quietly: "We've honored the intent of this place. The 
Commander who sealed this Vault wanted his treasures protected 
from desecration and theft. We've taken items to preserve them, 
not to loot them. That's respectful."
Kessa adds: "And we still have forty minutes before the ward 
expires. Plenty of time to exit cleanly."
 
EXITING THE VAULT
You step back through the bronze doors. As you cross the threshold, the 
spectral voice returns:
"RECOVERY COMPLETE. TERMS HONORED. CONDITIONAL 
ACCESS CONCLUDED."
The doors swing shut smoothly behind you, and the wards flare back to full 
strength-sealing the Vault once again.
"Well done," Thordin says with genuine respect. "We retrieved what we 
came for, preserved historical artifacts, and honored the sacred 
nature of the place. That's how professional delving should be 
done."
 
TREASURE ACQUIRED
Mission objective:
*	? Helm of Kharas (Thordin's contract, worth 10,000 gp to his client, 
your share is 3,000 gp)
Additional recoveries (split among party):
*	6 sealed document tubes (historical value, can be donated to 
Thorbardin archives or sold to scholars)
*	Shield of Thoradin's Hall (historical artifact, museum-quality)
*	Jewelry and insignia:
*	3 gold rings (possibly magical, need identification)
*	2 silver amulets (one with gemstone)
*	4 military rank pins (historical collectors would pay well)
Estimated additional value: 2,000-3,000 gp if sold, or significant 
goodwill if donated to appropriate dwarven institutions.
 
RETURN JOURNEY - BEGINNING
"Right," Thordin says, securing his pack. "We've got what we came for. 
The way back should be straightforward-the gricks are dead, the 
passage is clear. Let's head home."
The four of you make your way back through the administrative level, past the 
dead grick alpha, through the main chamber, and to the flooded passage.
The swim back through the submerged section is uneventful with 
Water Breathing still active. You pass the dead gricks floating in the water, 
emerge at the entrance level, and ascend through the barracks and main hall.
No additional encounters. The ruins are silent, the threats eliminated.
 
EMERGING FROM THORADIN'S HALL - LATE 
AFTERNOON
You step out of the ancient entrance into late afternoon sunlight. The fresh 
mountain air is a stark contrast to the stale, damp atmosphere of the ruins.
Mission time: Approximately 6-7 hours from entry to exit.
Thordin breathes deeply, grinning. "By the Forge, that went better than 
I could have hoped. Professional execution, no casualties, objective 
secured, bonus artifacts recovered. This is what proper delving 
looks like."
He looks at the three of you with genuine appreciation. "You're good. 
Really good. If I have other contracts that need skilled people, 
would you be interested?"
 
CYRUS'S STATE
You notice Cyrus looks... better. Not fully recovered from the emotional weight 
of Flotsam, but lighter. He's smiling, genuinely smiling, for the first time since 
the storm.
"That was good," he says quietly to you as you walk. "Just... good. A 
challenge overcome through skill and teamwork. No moral 
calculus. No counting deaths. Just solving problems and 
succeeding together."
He adjusts the document tubes in his pack. "And we preserved history. 
That matters. These records will help people understand what 
happened during the Cataclysm, help dwarven clans reconnect 
with their past. That's... that's meaningful work."
There's hope in his voice. Not complete healing-that will take time-but the 
beginning of it.
 
CAMP - FIRST NIGHT RETURN
You make camp as the sun sets, finding the same sheltered valley you used on 
the way in.
Around the fire, Thordin breaks out good dwarven whiskey. "To a 
successful delve. To professional work. And to companions who 
know their business."
You all drink.
"When we get back to Gateway," Thordin continues, "I'll arrange 
payment transfer. Three thousand gold, split as you prefer. And the 
additional artifacts-we can discuss how to handle those. Sell them 
and split the proceeds, or donate them for goodwill with 
Thorbardin. Your call."
He looks at the stars. "We should reach Gateway by tomorrow 
evening, then you can head back to Haven. Three to four days total, 
just as I promised."
 
How do you want to handle the additional artifacts?
1.	Sell them and split the gold (practical, immediate funds)
2.	Donate to Thorbardin (goodwill, potential future favors/contacts)
3.	Mixed approach (sell the jewelry, donate the documents and shield)
4.	Something else?
And is there anything you want to discuss around the campfire? This 
is a good moment for character interaction if you want it.
Wait. If this contact is in palanthas, let's go with Thorbadin as escort, then 
check out the deed we found in the aboleth lair.
Dec 10
CHANGE OF PLANS - PALANTHAS ROUTE
"Actually, Thordin," you say, "your client is in Palanthas, right?"
"Aye," the dwarf confirms. "Private collector there. Wealthy, discreet, 
pays well."
"We'll escort you to Palanthas," you continue. "We have business 
there ourselves-a property deed we recovered from an aboleth's 
hoard. Pre-Cataclysm warehouse. We need to check if it's still 
standing, see what the situation is."
Thordin raises an eyebrow, intrigued. "A pre-Cataclysm property deed? 
That could be valuable if the structure survived and the deed is still 
legally recognized. Palanthas is one of the few cities that 
maintained continuous legal records through the Cataclysm-they 
might honor it."
He considers. "Palanthas is about a week's travel from here, maybe a 
bit less if we push. Longer than the original job, but..." He grins. "I 
wouldn't mind the company. Safety in numbers, especially carrying 
something as valuable as the Helm. And if you help me with the 
delivery, I can introduce you to some useful contacts in the city."
Kessa nods. "Makes sense. Palanthas is a major city-we can 
resupply, gather intelligence, maybe pick up leads on other work."
Cyrus looks thoughtful. "Palanthas is also one of the great centers of 
learning. The Great Library is there. If we're donating those 
historical documents, that's where they'd have maximum scholarly 
impact. And the Temple of Paladine might have resources for... 
spiritual matters."
You catch the subtext-Cyrus is thinking about his own healing, seeking 
wisdom or counseling from higher-level clerics.
 
REVISED PLAN
"So here's what we do," you lay out. "We travel to Palanthas with 
Thordin-about a week's journey. He delivers the Helm to his 
client, we get paid our 3,000 gold. We investigate the warehouse 
deed situation. We donate the historical documents to the Great 
Library for preservation. And we take some time in the city to 
resupply, rest, and handle personal business."
"After that, we return to Haven-maybe another week's travel. 
Total time away from Haven: about three weeks."
Thordin raises his mug. "I like it. A proper expedition with multiple 
objectives. And Palanthas is worth seeing if you've never been-it's 
the jewel of Solamnia, or at least it was before the Dragon Army 
started making trouble."
"Is Palanthas under Dragon Army control?" Kessa asks sharply.
"Not yet," Thordin says. "It's neutral territory, technically. The city 
maintains its independence through walls, diplomacy, and the fact 
that taking it would be bloody expensive. But the Dragon Army has 
agents there, and tensions are high. You'll want to keep a low 
profile."
 
NOTIFYING HAVEN
You pull out your Sending Stone, the one paired with Commander Laurana 
at Haven.
Speaking into it, you say: "Laurana, mission successful. Escorting 
contact to Palanthas, investigating property deed, returning in 
approximately three weeks. All well."
A moment later, Laurana's voice comes through, tinny but 
clear: "Acknowledged, Commander. Palanthas-be careful, Dragon 
Army presence increasing there. Good hunting. Haven is stable."
The connection ends.
 
ARTIFACT DISTRIBUTION DECISION
"As for the additional artifacts," you say, "I suggest a mixed 
approach. We sell the jewelry to fund our operations-practical 
coin we can use. But we donate the documents and the shield to 
institutions in Palanthas-the Great Library for the documents, 
maybe Thorbardin's embassy or a museum for the shield. Build 
goodwill, honor the history properly."
Thordin nods approvingly. "Wise. The documents especially-the Great 
Library of Palanthas will preserve them properly and make them 
available to scholars. That's far better than selling them to a private 
collector who might hoard them."
Cyrus looks pleased. "I'll personally deliver the documents to the 
Library. I want to ensure they're treated with proper respect."
"And the jewelry?" Kessa asks. "How do we sell that?"
Thordin grins. "I know a reputable jeweler in Palanthas. He'll give 
fair prices, no questions asked. The rings might be magical-if they 
are, they're worth more. We can get them identified in the city."
 
THE JOURNEY TO PALANTHAS - OVERVIEW
Travel time: 7-8 days from current position Route: Mountain trails to 
Gateway (1 day), then main roads through Solamnic territories to Palanthas 
(6-7 days) Conditions: Late spring, good traveling weather, roads relatively 
safe (for now)
Thordin knows the route well and can guide you efficiently.
 
ANYTHING ELSE AROUND THE CAMPFIRE?
The fire crackles. The night is peaceful. You've had a successful mission with 
no casualties, you're heading to one of Krynn's great cities, and the mood is 
good.
Is there anything you want to discuss with your companions?
*	Check in on Cyrus's emotional state more directly?
*	Talk strategy for Palanthas (Dragon Army presence, staying low 
profile)?
*	Ask Thordin about his background or other delving stories?
*	Discuss the property deed situation and what to expect?
*	Just rest and move to the next day?
Or we can skip ahead to arrival at Gateway, or directly to Palanthas if you 
prefer.
What would you like to do?
Skip to Palanthas.
Dec 10
ARRIVAL AT PALANTHAS - 8 DAYS LATER
The journey has been uneventful-good weather, clear roads, no significant 
encounters. Thordin proved to be excellent company, sharing stories of past 
delves and dwarven history around evening campfires. The rhythm of travel, 
the changing landscape, the straightforward purpose-it's been restorative for 
everyone, especially Cyrus.
Now, as the sun reaches its zenith on the eighth day, you crest a hill and see it:
Palanthas.
 
THE JEWEL OF SOLAMNIA
Even from miles away, the city is breathtaking.
Palanthas sprawls across the coastal plain, protected by massive white walls 
that gleam in the sunlight. The city is enormous-easily ten times the size of 
Flotsam, perhaps fifty times Haven's hidden settlement. Spires and towers rise 
above the walls, the most prominent being the Tower of High 
Sorcery (now dark and abandoned) and the great Library of 
Palanthas with its distinctive dome.
The harbor is visible to the east-dozens of ships at anchor, trade vessels from 
across Ansalon. Despite the Dragon Army's rising power, Palanthas remains a 
hub of commerce and civilization.
But there are signs of tension:
*	The walls are heavily manned-you can see patrols even from this 
distance
*	Military camps outside the walls (Solamnic Knights? Dragon Army? 
Both?)
*	Fewer ships than there probably were before the war
*	A general atmosphere of watchfulness
Thordin points out landmarks:
"The Great Library-that domed building near the center. Largest 
collection of knowledge on Krynn, or so they claim. Your 
documents will be safe there."
"The Old City-that's the wealthy district, where nobles and 
merchants live. My client is there. We'll deliver the Helm 
tomorrow-I prefer not to walk through the city carrying 
something that valuable today."
"The warehouse district-eastern side, near the docks. That's 
where your deed property would be if it still exists."
"And see those camps outside the walls? Mixed. Some are Solamnic 
Knights maintaining order. Some are Dragon Army 'trade envoys' 
who are really spies and advance scouts. The city is officially 
neutral, but everyone's positioning for when that changes."
 
ENTERING THE CITY - AFTERNOON
You approach the southern gate. The guards are professional-Palanthas City 
Watch, not Dragon Army or Solamnic Knights. They wear distinctive blue and 
white tabards.
Gate inspection:
The guard captain, a weathered human in his forties, looks over your 
group: "State your business in Palanthas."
Thordin answers smoothly: "Thordin Ironhelm, master delver of 
Thorbardin. These are my associates. We're here on business-
artifact delivery, historical research, personal matters. Three to 
five days, then we depart."
The captain looks at each of you, his gaze lingering on your 
weapons. "Palanthas maintains strict peace within the walls. No 
brawling, no unsanctioned magic use, no causing trouble. Dragon 
Army and Solamnic Knights both have agents here-we don't care 
about your politics as long as you don't bring war to our streets. 
Understood?"
"Understood," you confirm.
"Entry tax: 5 silver per person." He holds out his hand.
You pay (2 gold total for the four of you), and he waves you 
through. "Welcome to Palanthas. Try the Golden Griffin Inn in the 
merchant quarter-clean rooms, fair prices. And stay out of 
trouble."
 
INSIDE PALANTHAS - FIRST IMPRESSIONS
Stepping through the gates is like entering a different world.
Paved streets. Actual cobblestones, well-maintained, with drainage gutters.
Multi-story buildings. Stone and timber construction, proper architecture, 
most buildings three or four stories tall.
Crowds. Thousands of people-humans, elves, dwarves, kender, even a few 
half-ogres. Merchants hawking wares, street performers, scholars in robes, 
soldiers on patrol, nobles in fine clothes being carried in litters.
Shops and businesses everywhere. Jewelers, bookbinders, weapon 
smiths, tailors, apothecaries, taverns, temples. This is a functioning, thriving 
city despite the war.
Kessa looks around with wide eyes. "This is... I've never seen anything 
like this. Haven is maybe 200 people. This is..."
"About 50,000 residents," Thordin supplies. "Plus maybe another 
10,000 refugees and traders at any given time. Palanthas is one of 
the last great free cities."
Cyrus is staring at the Library dome in the distance. "The knowledge 
contained in that building... centuries of scholarship, history, 
wisdom. I need to visit."
 
FINDING LODGING - THE GOLDEN GRIFFIN INN
Following the guard captain's recommendation, you find the Golden Griffin 
Inn in the merchant quarter. It's a well-maintained three-story building with 
a common room, private rooms, and stables.
The proprietor, a cheerful halfling woman named Miri Goldleaf, greets you 
warmly. "Welcome, travelers! Rooms for four? We have space-two 
silver per person per night, includes breakfast. Stabling for mounts 
if you have them, though I see you're on foot."
"Three nights to start," Thordin says, paying. "We may extend 
depending on business."
"Excellent! Rooms 7, 8, 9, and 10 on the second floor. Common 
room serves dinner at sunset. Anything you need in Palanthas, I 
can point you in the right direction-I know this city inside and 
out."
 
SETTLING IN - EARLY AFTERNOON
You claim your rooms, stash your packs (keeping valuables secured), and 
regroup in the common room.
Thordin lays out the plan:
"Tonight, we rest and get our bearings. Tomorrow morning, I'll 
deliver the Helm to my client-Johannes, I'd like you to come with 
me for security. Shouldn't take more than an hour, and you'll get 
your payment immediately."
"After that, we split up to handle our various business:"
*	Investigate the warehouse deed (Johannes + whoever wants to 
join)
*	Deliver documents to the Great Library (Cyrus is adamant about 
this)
*	Sell the jewelry (Thordin can handle this with Kessa if needed)
*	Personal errands (resupply, gather intelligence, whatever else)
"We regroup here each evening, share information, stay 
coordinated. Three to five days in the city, then we head back to 
Haven. Sound good?"
Everyone agrees.
 
CURRENT STATUS - LATE AFTERNOON IN 
PALANTHAS
Party:
*	Well-rested from the journey
*	Full resources (spells, HP, abilities)
*	Financially comfortable (~4,000 gp each plus the incoming 3,000 gp 
payment)
*	Safe lodging secured
*	Multiple objectives to accomplish
City situation:
*	Neutral but tense
*	Dragon Army agents present but not controlling
*	Solamnic Knights present but limited authority
*	City Watch maintaining order
*	Functioning economy and services
Your immediate objectives:
1.	Deliver Helm tomorrow morning (with Thordin)
2.	Investigate warehouse deed
3.	Deliver documents to Great Library (Cyrus)
4.	Sell jewelry
5.	Resupply/gather intelligence
 
What would you like to do with the rest of today?
1.	Explore the city, get oriented (familiarize yourself with layout, key 
locations)
2.	Visit the warehouse district now (scout the deed property before 
formal investigation)
3.	Gather intelligence (talk to locals, learn about Dragon Army 
presence, city politics)
4.	Rest and prepare for tomorrow (stay at the inn, plan strategy)
5.	Visit a specific location (Library? Temple? Markets?)
6.	Something else?
The afternoon sun slants through Palanthas's streets. The city awaits.
I go with Cyrus, while Kessa goes with Thordin.
Dec 10
SPLITTING UP - AFTERNOON ACTIVITIES
You make the decision quickly. "Cyrus and I will head to the Great 
Library-get a sense of the place, maybe start the document 
donation process. Kessa, you go with Thordin to scout the jeweler 
and get the rings identified. We'll regroup at dinner."
Kessa nods. "Works for me. I want to see what these rings are worth 
anyway."
Thordin grins. "Excellent. My jeweler contact can do magical 
identification-he's got the tools and the expertise. We'll know 
what we're dealing with by dinner."
Cyrus looks genuinely excited. "The Great Library of Palanthas. I've 
dreamed of visiting since I was an acolyte."
 
JOHANNES & CYRUS - THE GREAT LIBRARY
The two of you make your way through Palanthas's streets toward the Library. 
Cyrus walks with purpose, the document tubes carefully secured in his pack.
The walk takes about 20 minutes through increasingly scholarly 
districts-bookshops, scribe services, small academies, student housing. The 
people here are more subdued, intellectual, focused.
And then you see it up close:
The Great Library of Palanthas.
 
THE LIBRARY - EXTERIOR
The building is magnificent-easily the size of several city blocks. The central 
dome rises 100 feet into the air, covered in copper that's aged to a beautiful 
green patina. Wings extend from the main structure, each dedicated to 
different branches of knowledge.
The entrance is a grand colonnade with steps leading up to massive bronze 
doors. Carved into the stonework above: "KNOWLEDGE IS THE LIGHT 
THAT BANISHES DARKNESS"
Scholars, students, and researchers flow in and out constantly. This is a living 
institution, not a museum.
Cyrus stops at the base of the steps, just... looking.
"Three centuries of knowledge," he says quietly. "Histories, 
philosophies, sciences, magics. The accumulated wisdom of Krynn, 
preserved through the Cataclysm. If there are answers to the great 
questions of our time, they're in there."
He looks at you. "Thank you for coming with me. This matters."
 
ENTERING THE LIBRARY
You climb the steps and pass through the bronze doors into the main atrium.
The interior is breathtaking:
*	Vaulted ceilings with painted frescoes showing the history of learning
*	Reading tables scattered throughout, most occupied by scholars bent 
over manuscripts
*	Shelves stretching in every direction, organized by complex systems
*	Soft light from magical globes (not torches-fire is forbidden)
*	A sense of reverence, like entering a temple
A librarian approaches-an elderly elf woman in dark blue robes, her 
silver hair bound in a practical bun. She has the look of someone who's spent 
her entire long life among books.
"Welcome to the Great Library," she says in a soft but clear voice. "I am 
Laurelis, senior archivist. How may we assist you today?"
Cyrus steps forward respectfully. "Honored archivist, I am Brother 
Cyrus, cleric of Mishakal. My companion and I have recovered 
historical documents from the ruins of Thoradin's Hall-pre-
Cataclysm records sealed and preserved. We wish to donate them 
to the Library for proper preservation and scholarly study."
Laurelis's eyes widen slightly-genuine excitement breaking through her 
professional demeanor. "Pre-Cataclysm documents? From Thoradin's 
Hall? That outpost was lost 280 years ago. If you truly have intact 
records..."
She gestures urgently. "Please, come with me immediately. This 
requires the attention of our Chief Historian."
 
MEETING THE CHIEF HISTORIAN
Laurelis leads you through the Library at a brisk pace-deeper into the 
building, past reading rooms and storage areas, to a section 
marked "RESTRICTED - ARCHIVAL PRESERVATION".
She knocks on a door, opens it without waiting for response: "Master 
Aldric, you must see this."
The room beyond is an archivist's workshop-preservation tools, crystal 
storage tubes, magical glyphs for document protection. And at the center desk, 
bent over a manuscript with a magnifying lens:
Master Aldric Brightquill.
He's an older human, perhaps sixty, with ink-stained fingers and a scholar's 
stoop. But his eyes are sharp, intelligent, and they fix on the document tubes 
Cyrus is pulling from his pack with laser focus.
"Laurelis, this had better be-" He stops mid-sentence as he sees the 
tubes. "Are those... original seals? Those markings..."
Cyrus carefully places all six tubes on the examination table. "Recovered 
from the Commander's Vault in Thoradin's Hall. Sealed in crystal 
during the last days before the Cataclysm. Administrative records, 
military orders, personal correspondence, maps. All intact."
Aldric approaches the tubes like they're holy relics. His hands hover over 
them, not quite touching. "By the gods. Do you understand what you've 
brought us? Thoradin's Hall was a frontier outpost-its records 
were thought completely lost. These could contain information 
about pre-Cataclysm dwarven culture, military operations, trade 
routes, even personal accounts of what people knew or suspected 
before the world broke."
He looks at Cyrus with profound respect. "And you're... donating these? 
Not selling?"
"Yes," Cyrus says firmly. "Knowledge should be shared, preserved, 
studied. These documents belong to history, not to private 
collectors."
Aldric nods slowly. "Then on behalf of the Great Library of Palanthas, 
I accept this donation with profound gratitude." He gestures to the 
tubes. "May I?"
At Cyrus's nod, he carefully opens one tube and extracts the rolled parchment 
inside.
His hands tremble as he unrolls it.
"It's perfect," he breathes. "The preservation magic held completely. 
This is a military supply manifest dated three months before the 
Cataclysm. Look-here, this officer is reporting unusual seismic 
activity. And here, a note about refugees arriving from the coast 
claiming the gods had abandoned them..."
He looks up, tears in his eyes. "These are the voices of people who lived 
through the end of the world. Their words, their concerns, their 
last days. This is... this is invaluable."
 
FORMAL DONATION PROCESS
Aldric composes himself, becoming professional again. "Forgive my 
emotion. Let me handle this properly."
He produces a ledger and begins formal documentation:
"Name of donor?"
"Brother Cyrus of Mishakal. My companion, Johannes 
Constantinius, was instrumental in the recovery."
"Location of recovery?"
"Thoradin's Hall, approximately 80 miles northeast of Haven, 
within the ruins' Commander's Vault."
"Date of recovery?"
You provide the date.
"Contents?"
Cyrus describes each tube's contents as best he can determine from cursory 
examination.
Aldric writes it all down meticulously. Then he produces a certificate:
"This document formally acknowledges your donation to the Great 
Library. You will be credited in our archives and in any scholarly 
works that draw from these materials. Additionally..."
He pauses, considering. "The Library offers a reward for significant 
historical donations-both to encourage such generosity and to 
offset the costs adventurers incur in recovery. For materials of this 
quality and historical importance, the standard reward is 500 gold 
pieces."
Cyrus starts to protest-"We didn't do this for money-"
But Aldric raises a hand. "I know. But accept it anyway. Use it to fund 
further historical recoveries, or donate it to your temple, or spend 
it on ale. The policy exists for good reason."
He hands Cyrus a voucher. "Present this to the Library's bursar-first 
floor, western wing. He'll pay you immediately."
 
FINAL WORDS
As you prepare to leave, Aldric says: "Brother Cyrus, Johannes-you've 
done a great service today. Not just to scholarship, but to memory. 
These people who lived and died at Thoradin's Hall... they're not 
forgotten now. Their voices will be heard again."
He smiles. "And if you ever recover more historical materials, 
please, bring them here. We'll preserve them properly."
Cyrus bows respectfully. "Thank you, Master Aldric. It honors them, 
and us, to know their words will be studied and remembered."
 
LEAVING THE LIBRARY - CYRUS'S STATE
Outside, back in the afternoon sunlight, Cyrus is quiet for a long moment.
Then he speaks: "That felt... important. Not just strategically, not just 
practically. Morally important. Those documents will help people 
understand the past, learn from it, maybe avoid repeating 
mistakes."
He looks at you. "The people who died in the Flotsam storm-I can't 
bring them back. I can't undo what happened. But I can do things 
like this. Preserve history. Help scholars. Contribute to knowledge. 
That's... that's a kind of healing, isn't it? Making the world a little 
better, one action at a time."
There's something lighter in his expression. Not fully healed, but moving in 
that direction.
"Thank you for coming with me," he says simply.
 
MEANWHILE - KESSA & THORDIN
(Summarized, since you're with Cyrus)
Kessa and Thordin make their way to the jeweler district. Thordin's contact-
Master Gemstone Halver, a gnome jeweler with impressive credentials-
examines the jewelry carefully.
Results:
*	Ring 1: Ring of Protection (+1 AC, +1 saves) - Worth ~3,500 gp
*	Ring 2: Ring of Feather Falling - Worth ~1,500 gp
*	Ring 3: Non-magical but high-quality gold - Worth ~200 gp
*	Amulets: Non-magical, historical/decorative - Worth ~400 gp 
combined
*	Pins: Non-magical, collector value - Worth ~300 gp combined
Total potential sale: ~5,900 gp
Or: Keep the magical rings for party use, sell the rest (~900 gp).
Thordin and Kessa return to the inn to discuss options with the group.
 
DINNER AT THE GOLDEN GRIFFIN - EVENING
The four of you reunite in the common room as the sun sets. Miri serves a 
hearty meal-roasted chicken, vegetables, bread, decent ale.
Reports:
Thordin & Kessa:
*	Jewelry identified
*	Two magical rings (valuable or useful)
*	Rest is mundane but worth ~900 gp
*	Decision needed: sell all, or keep magicals?
Johannes & Cyrus:
*	Documents donated to Great Library
*	Formal recognition and thanks
*	500 gp reward received (Cyrus hands you 250 gp as your share)
*	Cyrus seems noticeably improved in mood
Tomorrow's plan:
*	Morning: Deliver Helm with Thordin (Johannes accompanies)
*	Afternoon: Investigate warehouse deed
*	Evening: Final decisions on remaining business
 
Current party funds (approximate):
*	Johannes: ~4,250 gp (+ 1,000 gp incoming from Helm delivery 
tomorrow)
*	Kessa: ~4,180 gp (+ 1,000 gp incoming)
*	Cyrus: ~4,180 gp (+ 1,000 gp incoming)
Jewelry decision needed:
1.	Keep both magical rings (add to party resources), sell rest (~900 gp 
split three ways = ~300 each)
2.	Sell everything (~5,900 gp split three ways = ~1,966 each)
3.	Keep one ring, sell the rest (compromise)
What's your preference?
Keep the magic rings, still everything else. Have a night where money is no 
object. Ooc - Good Beginning, but Cyrus needs something more cathartic. 
Think of the 1980s movie, The Mission. Not specifcally, but that depth.
Dec 10
EVENING DECISIONS & CELEBRATION
"We keep the magical rings," you decide. "Add them to our 
resources-they're more valuable to us as tools than as gold. Sell 
everything else and split the proceeds."
Everyone agrees. The non-magical items will be sold tomorrow, netting about 
300 gold each.
"And tonight," you continue, standing with your ale, "we celebrate 
properly. A successful mission, no casualties, good work done. 
Money is no object-best food, best drink, enjoy the city. We've 
earned it."
Thordin grins broadly. "Now THAT'S what I like to hear! Miri! Your 
finest vintage, and keep it coming!"
 
A NIGHT IN PALANTHAS - CELEBRATION
The evening unfolds with genuine joy:
Fine food and wine. Miri, delighted by free-spending customers, produces 
dishes normally reserved for nobles-roasted duck, honeyed vegetables, 
imported cheeses, desserts with chocolate and cream.
Stories and laughter. Thordin regales you with delving tales. Kessa shares 
(heavily edited) stories of past heists. Even Cyrus contributes, talking about 
his training at the temple, his mentor, the moment he first felt Mishakal's 
presence.
Music. A bard in the common room plays, and Kessa-surprisingly-knows 
the words to several traveling songs. She has a decent voice.
It's good. Simple, uncomplicated good. The kind of evening that reminds you 
why you fight-so people can have nights like this. Safe, warm, together.
But as the night winds down and others drift to their rooms, you notice Cyrus 
has grown quiet again. He's staring into his wine, the lightness from earlier 
fading.
 
OOC - CYRUS'S DEEPER HEALING
Understood. What Cyrus needs isn't just distraction or being told "it's okay." 
He needs something profound-a moment of grace, of being shown (not told) 
that redemption is real, that his burden can be transformed into something 
meaningful, that the weight he carries can become strength rather than 
crushing guilt.
Think The Mission-Father Gabriel's journey from guilt over past violence to 
sacrificial love. The moment where Robert De Niro's character drags his armor 
up the waterfall as penance, and the natives cut it free, releasing him.
Cyrus needs a moment of transformative encounter-something that 
shows him viscerally that his actions, however costly, had meaning, and that 
he can still be an instrument of healing rather than just death.
I have something planned. Trust me. It starts tomorrow, during what seems 
like routine business in the warehouse district, but becomes something much 
deeper.
For now, let's end tonight with you noticing Cyrus's state:
 
LATE EVENING - CHECKING ON CYRUS
Most of the common room has emptied. Cyrus sits alone at a corner table, 
wine mostly untouched, staring at nothing.
You slide into the seat across from him.
"Brother. You seemed lighter earlier. After the Library."
Cyrus nods slowly. "I was. I am. The donation mattered. Preserving 
history, helping scholars-it felt good. Meaningful."
He pauses. "But it's not enough, Johannes. I know it's not supposed 
to be-one good deed doesn't erase 547 deaths. I'm not that naive. 
But I thought... I hoped... that doing something unambiguously 
good would make the weight less."
He looks at you, and there's pain in his eyes. "It didn't. The number is still 
there. The faces I imagine-sailors I never saw, men I killed from 
five miles away. They're still there when I close my eyes."
"I don't regret the decision," he clarifies quickly. "We saved 
thousands. We stopped an invasion. It was the right choice. But 
knowing it was right doesn't make carrying it easier."
He's not asking for answers. He's just... bearing witness to his own struggle.
What do you say?
(This sets up tomorrow's events, where something will happen that gives 
Cyrus the deeper healing he needs. But this moment matters too-your 
response, how you meet him in this pain.)
You're right. Sometimes, the right thing is the hard thing, and there is no way 
to unburden it. The price stays. And you are the only one who can carry it.
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S RESPONSE
You don't look away from Cyrus's pain. You meet it directly.
"You're right. Sometimes the right thing is the hard thing, and 
there is no way to unburden it. The price stays. And you are the 
only one who can carry it."
Cyrus's eyes widen slightly-he wasn't expecting that. No platitudes, no "it'll 
get easier," no attempts to minimize what he carries.
You continue, your voice quiet but firm:
"I can't take this from you, Cyrus. Neither can Kessa, neither can 
Laurana or anyone else. Those 547 souls-you felt each one pass. 
That's yours to carry. That's the cost of wielding that kind of power 
for that kind of purpose."
You lean forward slightly. "But here's what I can tell you: You're not 
carrying it alone in terms of purpose. We made the decision 
together. We stand by it together. And if that weight ever threatens 
to crush you, we'll be there to remind you why you carry it."
"You saved Ak-Thyln. You saved Kalaman. You saved thousands of 
people who will never know your name, never know what you 
sacrificed for them. That doesn't make the weight lighter-but it 
makes it meaningful. And meaningful weight... that's different 
from meaningless suffering."
You pause, then add: "You're still Cyrus. Still a healer. Still a servant 
of Mishakal. The storm didn't change that-it proved it. You were 
willing to take on that burden, to carry those deaths, to sacrifice 
your own peace... for others. That's not corruption, Brother. That's 
love. Terrible, costly, sacrificial love."
 
Cyrus is silent for a long moment. Then he speaks, his voice rough:
"Thank you. For not... for not trying to make it easier than it is. For 
respecting that this is... real. Heavy. Mine."
He drains his wine, sets the cup down. "I'm going to carry this for the 
rest of my life. I know that now. But maybe... maybe if I can find 
ways to make it count-to use what I've learned, what I've 
experienced, to help others-then it won't just be weight. It'll be... 
ballast. Keeping me grounded. Keeping me honest."
He stands, places a hand on your shoulder. "Get some rest, my friend. 
Tomorrow we investigate your warehouse. And who knows-maybe 
Palanthas has more to teach us than we expect."
He heads upstairs, walking like a man carrying a heavy burden-but carrying 
it deliberately, purposefully, not crushed by it.
 
MORNING - THE HELM DELIVERY
You wake early, dress, and meet Thordin in the common room. He's already 
eaten breakfast and is securing the carefully wrapped Helm in his pack.
"Ready?" he asks. "My client lives in the Old City-wealthy district. 
Shouldn't take more than an hour for the whole transaction. Then 
you get your 1,000 gold, I get my 7,000, and we're done."
Kessa appears at the stairs. "I'm coming too. Three people carrying that 
much gold through city streets is smarter than two."
Thordin grins. "Fair point. The more the merrier."
Cyrus joins you as well. "May as well make it four. I'm curious to see 
the Old City anyway."
 
THE OLD CITY - MORNING
The four of you make your way through Palanthas toward the wealthy district. 
The Old City is a stark contrast to the merchant quarter-wide streets, elegant 
townhouses, private gardens, guards at every corner.
Thordin leads you to a particular mansion-three stories, marble facade, 
discreet but clearly expensive.
"This is it. Lord Varkis Threnody, private collector. Eccentric but 
honorable. He'll pay immediately and in full."
You're admitted by a butler, led through a tastefully decorated interior, and 
brought to a private study where Lord Varkis awaits.
He's a human in his sixties, scholarly looking, surrounded by display cases 
containing historical artifacts. When he sees Thordin, his face lights up.
"Master Ironhelm! You've returned! And you have it?"
Thordin carefully unwraps the Helm of Kharas.
Lord Varkis actually gasps. He approaches it with trembling hands, examining 
it from every angle. "Perfect. Absolutely perfect. Three centuries lost, 
and here it is, as magnificent as the day it was forged."
He looks at Thordin with genuine emotion. **"You've done what others said 
was impossible. Name your price."
"Ten thousand gold pieces, as agreed," Thordin says calmly.
"Done." Lord Varkis doesn't even haggle. He produces a letter of credit-
negotiable at any major bank in Palanthas. "Payable immediately. And 
Master Ironhelm-if you ever recover other items of dwarven 
heritage, I'm always interested."
 
PAYMENT - OUTSIDE THE MANSION
Once you're back on the street, Thordin leads you directly to a bank. Within 
thirty minutes, the letter of credit is converted to actual gold:
*	7,000 gp for Thordin
*	1,000 gp each for Johannes, Kessa, and Cyrus
The bank provides you with secure carrying options (letters of credit, 
gemstones for portability, or actual coin-your choice).
"Pleasure doing business with you," Thordin says, shaking hands with 
each of you. "If you ever want to do another delve, you know where 
to find me."
 
CURRENT PARTY FUNDS (Updated):
*	Johannes: ~5,250 gp (+ 300 gp pending from jewelry sale)
*	Kessa: ~5,180 gp (+ 300 gp pending)
*	Cyrus: ~5,180 gp (+ 300 gp pending)
You're all quite wealthy now by adventurer standards.
 
AFTERNOON - THE WAREHOUSE DISTRICT
With the Helm delivery complete, you turn to your next objective: 
investigating the property deed from the aboleth's lair.
You pull out the pre-Cataclysm deed-aged parchment, but still legible, 
detailing ownership of a warehouse in Palanthas's eastern district near the 
docks.
"Let's see if this place even still exists," Kessa says.
The four of you make your way to the warehouse district-a busy area of 
loading docks, storage facilities, merchant offices. The smell of sea salt, fish, 
and timber fills the air.
Following the deed's description and asking a few locals, you eventually find 
the address:
Warehouse 47, Eastdock Quarter.
And it's... still standing.
 
WAREHOUSE 47 - EXTERIOR
The building is old-pre-Cataclysm construction, clearly. Three stories, stone 
foundation, timber upper levels. It's weathered but structurally sound. The 
windows are shuttered, the main door is chained and locked.
But someone has been maintaining it-the roof is patched, the chains are new, 
and there's a faded sign: "PROPERTY OF EASTDOCK MERCHANT 
COLLECTIVE - INQUIRIES TO HARBORMASTER"
"Interesting," Thordin murmurs. "It survived the Cataclysm, and 
someone's been keeping it from falling apart. But it's currently 
unclaimed or in administrative limbo."
Cyrus examines the deed carefully. "This document pre-dates the 
Cataclysm. If Palanthas's legal system honored continuity of 
ownership through the disaster, this deed might still be valid. 
But..."
"But someone else might have claimed it in the intervening 280 
years," Kessa finishes.
 
INVESTIGATING OWNERSHIP - THE 
HARBORMASTER
You follow the sign's instruction and head to the Harbormaster's office-a 
busy administrative building overseeing all dock activity.
After some bureaucratic navigation, you're directed to a clerk handling 
property records: Magister Orin Blackquill, a fastidious half-elf with ink-
stained fingers.
You present the deed.
His eyes widen. "This is... this predates the Cataclysm. Where did you 
acquire this?"
"Salvage from an abandoned location," you answer carefully. "We're 
inquiring whether it's still legally valid."
Magister Blackquill examines it with professional scrutiny, cross-referencing 
with thick ledgers. After several minutes, he looks up.
"This is fascinating. Warehouse 47 has been in administrative 
limbo for 180 years. The original owner-one Elias Merchent-died 
in the Cataclysm with no heirs. The property was claimed by the 
city, but never formally processed due to the chaos. It's been 
maintained by the Eastdock Collective as a public warehouse, but 
no one technically owns it."
He taps the deed. "This document, if authentic, represents legitimate 
pre-Cataclysm ownership. Under Palanthas law, such deeds are 
honored if they can be verified. However..."
He pauses. "Verification requires proof of chain of ownership. Can 
you demonstrate how this deed came into your possession legally?"
 
This is a decision point. You could:
1.	Explain truthfully (recovered from aboleth's hoard, legitimate 
salvage)
2.	Claim inheritance (false, but simpler)
3.	Offer to purchase current claim (bypass the legal complexity)
4.	Investigate the Eastdock Collective's interest (they might 
contest)
But before you can respond, something interrupts:
A commotion outside-shouting, the sound of running feet, a woman's 
voice crying for help.
Magister Blackquill frowns. "What in the-"
You all rush to the window.
 
THE INTERRUPTION - SOMETHING MORE 
IMPORTANT
Outside the Harbormaster's office, in the busy dock square, there's chaos.
A wagon has overturned, spilling its cargo into the street. But that's not 
the problem.
The problem is the dozen people trapped beneath it-dock workers who 
were unloading, now pinned by the massive wooden structure and its load of 
stone blocks.
People are screaming. Some are trying to lift the wagon, but it's too heavy. 
Others are running for help.
And then you see what made it worse: Fire. One of the lanterns from the 
wagon has ignited spilled oil. Flames are spreading toward the trapped 
workers.
People are going to die. Soon. Maybe minutes.
The City Watch is responding, but they're not here yet. Bystanders are 
panicking.
 
Cyrus's face goes pale. Then resolves into absolute determination.
"Johannes. We have to help. Now."
He's already moving toward the door.
 
This is the beginning of Cyrus's deeper redemption arc. What 
happens next will matter immensely to him.
What do you do?
1.
Dec 10
IMMEDIATE ACTION - THE OVERTURNED 
WAGON
"Move!" you shout, already sprinting toward the chaos with Cyrus.
Kessa and Thordin are right behind you, no hesitation.
You burst out of the Harbormaster's office into the dock square. The scene is 
worse up close:
 
THE DISASTER SCENE
The wagon: Massive freight hauler, now on its side. Its load-stone blocks, 
each weighing hundreds of pounds-has partially spilled, pinning people 
beneath the weight.
The trapped: You count eleven people visible-dock workers, a wagon 
driver, even a child who was apparently playing nearby. Some are crying out in 
pain, some are ominously silent, some are screaming for help.
The fire: Spreading fast. Spilled lamp oil has ignited, flames crawling toward 
the overturned wagon where people are trapped. Maybe two minutes before 
the fire reaches them.
Bystanders: Panicking, some trying to help but unable to move the weight, 
others running for authorities who aren't here yet.
 
CYRUS TAKES COMMAND
Brother Cyrus's voice cuts through the chaos like a blade: "EVERYONE 
LISTEN! WE'RE GETTING THEM OUT! YOU-" he points to nearby 
dock workers "-get buckets, fight that fire! YOU-" pointing to 
others "-help us lift when I say!"
His tone brooks no argument. People respond instinctively to authority in 
crisis.
He looks at your group: "Johannes, Thordin-we lift the wagon 
together. Kessa-pull people out as we create space. I'll heal anyone 
critical."
No discussion. No debate. Pure decisive action.
 
ROUND 1 - LIFTING THE WAGON
Thordin immediately moves to the wagon's frame. "Here! This 
structural point! If we lift together-"
You join him, gripping the heavy timber. "On three!"
Athletics check (group effort, each person contributes):
*	Johannes: 16 + 0 (STR) = 16
*	Thordin: Natural 20 + 4 = 24 (CRITICAL)
*	Cyrus: 12 + 1 = 13
Combined: Enough! (Thordin's exceptional strength makes the difference)
With Thordin's dwarven might leading, the three of you heave. The wagon 
shifts, groaning, rising a few inches. Stone blocks slide, creating gaps.
"NOW! PULL THEM!" Cyrus shouts.
 
KESSA'S RESCUE - FIRST VICTIMS
Kessa darts into the space you've created. Her small size and agility let her 
reach people the larger rescuers can't.
"I've got two!" She grabs a young woman by the arms, dragging her 
clear. "She's breathing-broken leg, maybe ribs!"
She dives back in, pulls out an older man. "This one's worse-crushed 
chest, not breathing well!"
Two rescued. Nine still trapped.
 
CYRUS - FIRST HEALING
Cyrus drops to his knees beside the man with the crushed chest. His hands 
glow with Mishakal's blue-white light.
"Breathe," he commands, pressing his palms to the man's 
sternum. "BREATHE!"
Cure Wounds (3rd level): 3d8+4 = 18 HP restored
The man gasps, coughs blood, then gasps again-this time actually pulling air. 
His eyes open wide with shock and relief.
"Get him clear!" Cyrus orders bystanders, already moving to the next 
victim. "Keep lifting!"
 
ROUND 2 - THE FIRE PROBLEM
The flames are 30 feet away and advancing fast. The bucket brigade is 
forming but not fast enough.
"Johannes!" Kessa shouts. "Can you slow that fire?"
You look at the spreading flames. You have options:
*	Eldritch Blast the oil barrels away from the trapped workers (create 
firebreak)
*	Create Water if Cyrus can cast it
*	Something else?
But then-
A voice from the crowd: "MAKE WAY! CITY MAGE!"
A young woman in blue robes pushes through-maybe twenty-five, 
official city insignia, clearly a sanctioned spellcaster.
She sees the fire, makes a quick gesture, and casts: "CONTROL FLAMES!"
The fire stops spreading. Not extinguished, but contained-frozen in place, 
no longer advancing toward the trapped workers.
"Go!" she shouts to you. "I'll hold it as long as I can! Get them out!"
 
ROUND 3 - MASS EXTRACTION
With the fire contained, everyone focuses on lifting and pulling.
More dock workers join the effort-your leadership and visible action 
has organized the chaos into coordinated rescue.
"LIFT! ALL TOGETHER!" Thordin roars.
The wagon rises higher. More space. Kessa and others pull frantically.
Three more rescued. Then two more. Then another.
Cyrus moves between them like lightning-Cure Wounds, Cure Wounds, 
Healing Word-triaging, stabilizing, keeping people alive long enough for 
proper medical care.
 
THE CRITICAL MOMENT - THE CHILD
"THERE'S A CHILD!" someone screams. "UNDER THE STONE 
BLOCKS!"
You see her-a girl, maybe eight years old, pinned beneath one of the massive 
stone blocks that shifted when the wagon fell. She's conscious, crying, 
reaching out with one free arm.
But the block weighs perhaps 500 pounds. And it's positioned such that 
if you move it wrong, the whole pile could shift and crush her.
Kessa: "I can't reach her-the gap's too small and the angle's 
wrong!"
Thordin: "That block-if we lift it straight up, we can do it, but 
someone needs to be IN THERE to pull her the instant we lift. 
Otherwise she's stuck."
Cyrus doesn't hesitate. "I'll get her."
"Brother, if that block shifts-" you start.
"Then I'll be crushed," Cyrus says calmly. "But she'll die for certain if 
we don't try. Johannes, Thordin-can you lift it?"
 
This is the moment. Cyrus is willingly putting himself in mortal danger to 
save a child's life.
Athletics check to lift the block (you and Thordin, DC 18):
What do you do?
1.	Lift with Thordin, trust your strength (straight Athletics check)
2.	Use Hex on the block? (doesn't make sense mechanically, but you're 
desperate)
3.	Call for more help (more people = better chance, but takes precious 
seconds)
4.	Try a different approach (magic? leverage? something else?)
The little girl is crying, calling for her mother. Cyrus is already crawling into 
the space, positioning himself to grab her.
The clock is ticking.
Lift
Dec 10
THE LIFT - STRENGTH AND FAITH
You position yourself on one side of the massive stone block, Thordin on the 
other. The block is easily 500 pounds, sitting at an awkward angle on top of 
other debris. If you lift wrong, the whole pile shifts and crushes both Cyrus 
and the child.
"On my count," Thordin says, his voice steady despite the 
tension. "Straight up. No twisting. Hold it until Cyrus is clear."
You nod, gripping the stone. Your hands find purchase on rough edges.
Cyrus is already in position, lying flat beneath the precarious pile, reaching for 
the little girl. "I've got her hand. Just lift-I'll do the rest."
"THREE!" Thordin counts.
You brace yourself, every muscle tensing.
"TWO!"
The little girl is sobbing. "It hurts! It hurts!"
"I know, sweetheart," Cyrus says gently. "Just a few more seconds. 
You're so brave."
"ONE! LIFT!"
 
ATHLETICS CHECK - CRITICAL MOMENT
Johannes:
*	Roll: 14 + 0 (STR) = 14
Thordin:
*	Roll: 17 + 4 (STR) = 21
Combined effort: 35 total vs DC 18 for the lift
 
SUCCESS
You HEAVE.
The stone block rises-not much, just a few inches, but it's enough. The weight 
is immense, like lifting a horse, your arms screaming with the strain.
"NOW, CYRUS!" you grunt through clenched teeth.
Cyrus doesn't waste a second. His arms wrap around the little girl, and 
he yanks her free, rolling sideways out of the danger zone even as his body 
scrapes against jagged debris.
"CLEAR!" Kessa shouts.
You and Thordin release the block. It crashes back down with a 
massive THUD that shakes the ground-right where the child had been lying 
moments before.
 
THE AFTERMATH
Cyrus emerges from beneath the wagon wreckage, the little girl clutched in his 
arms. She's crying but alive, conscious, moving all her limbs.
"Mama!" she wails, reaching out.
A woman breaks through the crowd, screaming: "LILA! MY BABY!"
Cyrus gently passes the child to her mother. They collapse together, sobbing 
with relief.
But Cyrus doesn't pause. "She needs healing. Crushed leg, possible 
internal injuries."
He places his hands on the child, and Mishakal's light flares once more.
Cure Wounds (2nd level): 2d8+4 = 14 HP restored
The little girl gasps as divine magic knits broken bones, repairs crushed tissue, 
eases pain. The impossible healing of the gods made manifest.
"She'll be fine," Cyrus tells the mother. "Get her to a proper healer for 
observation, but she'll be fine."
The mother looks at him with tears streaming down her face. "You saved 
her. You risked your life to save my daughter. I don't... I don't have 
words..."
Cyrus just nods, already moving to the next victim.
 
FINAL TALLY - 15 MINUTES LATER
The fire is fully extinguished. The City Watch has arrived with proper 
equipment. Healers are tending to the injured.
Final count:
*	11 people trapped under the wagon
*	11 people rescued alive
*	Zero deaths
*	Multiple serious injuries stabilized by Cyrus
It's a miracle. Everyone is saying so-if those adventurers hadn't been there, 
if that cleric hadn't acted so fast, half these people would be dead.
 
CYRUS - THE MOMENT OF GRACE
Cyrus sits on a dock post, breathing hard, covered in blood and dirt and soot. 
His robes are torn. His hands are scraped raw. He's exhausted, having burned 
through most of his spell slots.
But people keep approaching him.
The mother with the little girl: "Thank you. Thank you. Mishakal bless 
you."
The man whose crushed chest Cyrus healed: "You brought me back. I 
wasn't breathing, and you brought me back."
A dock worker who was pulled free: "I've got four kids at home. Because 
of you, I'll see them tonight."
One after another, they come. Not to pay him. Not to praise him as a hero. 
Just to bear witness-to say, simply and directly: You saved my life. I'm 
alive because of you.
 
And then something shifts in Cyrus's expression.
His hands are shaking. Not from exhaustion. From emotion.
He looks at them-really looks. The mother holding her daughter. The man 
breathing again. The worker who will see his children.
Eleven people. Eleven lives saved. Eleven souls who will go home tonight, 
who will wake tomorrow, who will live and love and laugh because he acted.
Tears start streaming down his face.
"Eleven," he whispers. "Eleven."
Then louder, to himself, working through something profound:
"Five hundred forty-seven died. Eleven lived. The numbers don't 
balance. They'll never balance. But these eleven... they're REAL. 
They're here. They're breathing. I can SEE them."
He stands, looks at the mother and child.
"I couldn't see the five hundred forty-seven. I felt them pass, but I 
never saw their faces. They were... abstract. Numbers. Weight. 
Guilt."
"But this..." He gestures to the rescued workers, the crying child now safe in 
her mother's arms. "This is REAL. This is what Mishakal calls me to 
do. Not to count the dead. To save the living."
He looks at you, Johannes, and there's something in his eyes-not quite peace, 
not yet, but hope. Real hope.
"I can't bring back the five hundred forty-seven. But I can save 
eleven today. And eleven tomorrow. And eleven the day after that. 
For the rest of my life, I can SAVE people. That's what this power is 
for. Not to calculate costs. To preserve life."
 
The little girl-Lila-breaks free from her mother and runs back to Cyrus. She 
throws her small arms around his legs.
"Thank you, mister healer man. You were brave."
Cyrus kneels down to her level. His voice breaks: "No, sweetheart. You 
were brave. You held on. You trusted me. You're alive because YOU 
were brave."
She hugs him again, then runs back to her mother.
 
Cyrus stands, and for the first time since the storm, he looks like himself 
again. Not undamaged. Not without scars. But whole.
"Johannes," he says quietly. "I think... I think I understand now. The 
five hundred forty-seven will always be part of me. But so will Lila. 
So will these eleven. And every life I save from now on. The weight 
doesn't disappear-but it becomes... bearable. Because it's 
balanced by purpose."
He takes a deep, shuddering breath. "I'm still a healer. That's who I am. 
And that's enough."
 
THE CITY RESPONDS
The City Watch Captain approaches-the same one who let you through the 
gates. He looks at your group with new respect.
"That was exceptional work. You saved lives today. Palanthas is in 
your debt."
The City Mage who contained the fire joins him. "Agreed. That was the 
most efficient rescue operation I've ever seen. Are you affiliated 
with any temple or guild?"
Before you can answer, the Harbormaster himself emerges from his office, 
having witnessed everything. "You were inquiring about Warehouse 47, 
yes? The deed?"
He looks at Cyrus specifically. "That man just saved eleven dock 
workers-people I'm responsible for. Consider the deed verified. 
I'll personally expedite the paperwork. Warehouse 47 is yours. No 
questions asked."
He extends his hand. "Welcome to Palanthas, Brothers. We need 
people like you."
 
OUTCOME
Mission complete (unexpected):
*	11 lives saved
*	Zero casualties
*	City authorities grateful
*	Warehouse 47 ownership secured through goodwill
Cyrus's state:
*	Profoundly changed
*	Not "healed" of his guilt, but transformed by it
*	Now sees his power as calling, not curse
*	Purpose restored: Save the living
Party status:
*	Slightly depleted spell slots (Cyrus used several)
*	Minor injuries (scrapes, bruises)
*	Massive goodwill with Palanthas authorities
*	Unexpected property ownership
 
It's now late afternoon. What do you want to do?
1.	Inspect Warehouse 47 (it's yours now, see what you've got)
2.	Rest and recover (return to inn, let Cyrus process)
3.	Follow up with authorities (formalize the deed transfer)
4.	Something else?
The dock square is returning to normal. People are clearing debris. The 
rescued workers are being tended to.
And Cyrus stands among them, tears drying on his face, looking lighter than 
he has in weeks.
3, then 1.
Dec 10
FORMALIZING THE DEED - HARBORMASTER'S 
OFFICE
The Harbormaster-Master Devin Stormcrest, a weathered human in his 
fifties with the bearing of a career naval officer-leads you back into his office 
personally.
"Magister Blackquill," he calls to the clerk you'd been dealing with 
earlier. "The deed for Warehouse 47. These people have just saved 
eleven of our workers' lives. I'm invoking emergency municipal 
authority to expedite ownership transfer."
Blackquill looks startled but immediately pulls out the relevant ledgers. "Sir, 
the standard verification process requires-"
"I'm aware of the process," Stormcrest interrupts, not unkindly. "And 
I'm overriding it. That cleric crawled under five hundred pounds of 
stone to pull out a child. I watched it happen. If he's willing to risk 
his life for our people, we can damn well process some paperwork 
quickly."
He looks at you. "The deed you presented-pre-Cataclysm, legitimate 
construction, unclaimed for 180 years. Under Palanthas law, 
salvaged historical documents of clear provenance are recognized. 
You recovered it legally from an abandoned site. That's sufficient."
 
THE PAPERWORK - 30 MINUTES
Magister Blackquill, seeing his superior's determination, works with 
remarkable efficiency:
"I'll need your names for the official registry."
You provide them: Johannes Constantinius, Kessa Darrow, Brother Cyrus.
"Ownership structure?"
"Equal three-way partnership," you decide quickly. Everyone nods 
agreement.
"Purpose of property?"
"General use-storage, operations base, commercial rental, to be 
determined," Kessa answers professionally.
Blackquill writes furiously, stamps multiple documents with official seals, has 
Master Stormcrest countersign as authorizing authority.
"There," he says finally, handing you three copies of the formalized deed-
one for each partner. "Warehouse 47, Eastdock Quarter, officially 
registered to your partnership. Current property taxes: 50 gold per 
year, payable to the city. Any commercial use requires appropriate 
licensing, but storage and personal use are unrestricted."
He pauses, then adds quietly: "And for what it's worth-thank you. My 
cousin was one of the workers you pulled out today. He's alive 
because of you."
 
Master Stormcrest adds: "The Eastdock Collective has been 
maintaining the building in the city's absence. They've done good 
work-the structure is sound, the roof is patched, the foundation is 
solid. You're not inheriting a ruin. You're inheriting a functional 
warehouse that just needs some attention."
He hands you a key-old, iron, but well-maintained. "This opens the main 
door. The Collective's foreman has been holding it. I'll send word 
that ownership has transferred."
"One more thing," he says, his tone becoming more serious. "You've 
made a good impression today. Palanthas needs people like you-
competent, principled, willing to act. If you're staying in the city, or 
if you return in the future, know that you have friends here. The 
Harbormaster's office, the City Watch, even the Lord's Council-
word will spread about what you did today."
"Just... be careful. Palanthas is neutral territory, but the Dragon 
Army has eyes everywhere. If they learn about skilled resistance 
operatives in the city, they'll take an interest. Keep your heads 
down when necessary."
 
WAREHOUSE 47 - INSPECTION
Armed with the key and official ownership documents, the four of you make 
your way through the dock district to your newly acquired property.
Warehouse 47 sits on a reasonably prominent corner lot, with access to both 
a main street and a smaller alley. The three-story structure shows its age but 
also its quality-pre-Cataclysm construction means it was built to last.
You unlock the main door (the chain was removed by the Collective after 
Stormcrest sent word) and step inside.
 
INTERIOR - GROUND FLOOR
The main level is a large open space-roughly 60 feet by 40 feet, with a 20-foot 
ceiling. Support pillars run down the center.
Current state:
*	Clean and dry. The Collective has been maintaining it well-no leaks, 
no rot, no pest infestations
*	Empty. Whatever was stored here was cleared out long ago
*	Loading dock on one side with large double doors opening to the 
street
*	Smaller side door to the alley (for discrete access)
*	Stairs leading up to the second and third floors
Thordin examines the structure professionally: "This is solid work. 
Dwarven-influenced construction techniques-see those support 
pillars? That's proper load-bearing architecture. This building 
could stand another three centuries easily."
 
SECOND FLOOR
Up the stairs, you find the second level is divided into rooms:
*	Four medium-sized chambers (could be offices, private storage, 
living quarters)
*	One larger open space (could be meeting room, workshop, barracks)
*	Small water closet with a (currently non-functional) pump system
Windows provide good light and ventilation. The rooms are bare but 
serviceable.
Kessa's assessment: "This could be converted to comfortable living 
space. Or kept as offices and secure storage. We've got options."
 
THIRD FLOOR
The top level is another open space, though smaller than the ground floor 
(maybe 40 feet by 30 feet). The ceiling here is only 12 feet high, but there 
are skylights that let in natural light.
Current state:
*	Empty except for some old crates and forgotten equipment
*	Access to the roof via a hatch
*	Good views of the surrounding district
From the roof, you can see the harbor, the city walls, major streets. It's 
actually quite a strategic location for observation.
 
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
Thordin gives his professional opinion: "This is valuable property. 
Not mansion-level, but in a major city like Palanthas? This is worth 
at least 5,000 gold, maybe more depending on market conditions. 
The fact that you got it through salvage and goodwill rather than 
purchase? That's exceptional."
Kessa adds: "It's also defensible. One main entrance, one side 
entrance, both easily secured. Upper floors provide height 
advantage. If we ever need a safe house in Palanthas, this is ideal."
Cyrus looks thoughtful: "It could also serve the resistance. Secure 
storage for supplies, meetings space, a base of operations away 
from Haven. Or we could rent it commercially and generate income 
to fund resistance activities."
 
POTENTIAL USES FOR WAREHOUSE 47
You discuss possibilities:
Option 1: Personal Safe House
*	Keep it private, use it when you're in Palanthas
*	Secure storage for equipment and valuables
*	Emergency fallback position
Option 2: Resistance Operations Base
*	Coordinate with Haven to use it for intelligence gathering
*	Store supplies, weapons, documents
*	Meeting space for resistance operatives in Palanthas
Option 3: Commercial Rental
*	Rent to legitimate merchants for income (50-100 gp/month)
*	Maintains cover, generates revenue
*	Less secure for sensitive operations
Option 4: Mixed Use
*	Ground floor: Commercial rental or legitimate front business
*	Upper floors: Private resistance operations
*	Balances income with operational security
Option 5: Leave It
*	Pay the 50 gp/year taxes, keep it maintained but unused
*	Option available for future need
 
Thordin says: "Whatever you decide, I'd recommend hiring a 
caretaker-someone to maintain the building, handle any 
commercial arrangements, and keep an eye on things when you're 
not in the city. The Eastdock Collective could probably recommend 
someone trustworthy."
 
Current status:
*	Time: Late afternoon, approaching evening
*	Party condition: Slightly tired, Cyrus depleted spell slots but 
emotionally restored
*	In Palanthas: 1 day, probably staying 1-2 more
*	Property secured: Warehouse 47, yours to use as you see fit
What's your decision about the warehouse?
And what do you want to do with the rest of your time in Palanthas?
*	Resupply and prepare for return to Haven?
*	Explore the city more?
*	Rest and recover?
*	Something else?
The sun is setting over Palanthas, painting the harbor in gold and orange light. 
You own property in one of Krynn's greatest cities. And Cyrus-Brother 
Cyrus-stands beside you, looking more like himself than he has since the 
storm.
1.	Allow Haven to take on the maintenance of the location as a staging 
area for their activities, with the understanding that the upper areas are 
reserved for our personal use.
Dec 10
WAREHOUSE 47 - DECISION AND 
ARRANGEMENTS
"We keep it as a safe house," you decide. "But we make it available to 
Haven as a staging area for resistance operations in Palanthas. 
They handle maintenance and operational costs beyond the base 
taxes. Upper floors remain reserved for our personal use when 
we're in the city."
Kessa nods approvingly. "Smart. We get a secure location in Palanthas 
without ongoing costs, Haven gets operational infrastructure in a 
neutral city. Win-win."
Cyrus adds: "And if Haven uses it for legitimate resistance work-
intelligence gathering, coordination with Solamnic Knights, supply 
distribution-it serves a higher purpose. That matters."
Thordin strokes his beard. "I can put you in touch with the Eastdock 
Collective's foreman-a dwarf named Grimbold Ironfoot. Solid 
fellow, discreet, no love for the Dragon Army. He could serve as 
caretaker and cover, handle legitimate merchant inquiries while 
keeping Haven's activities secure."
 
IMMEDIATE ARRANGEMENTS
Before leaving the warehouse, you take some practical steps:
Security:
*	Change the locks (Kessa handles this with her tools-30 minutes, 5 gp 
for new hardware)
*	Identify best entry/exit points for discrete operations
*	Note structural vulnerabilities that need addressing
Marking territory:
*	Leave personal items in the upper-floor quarters (establishing legitimate 
occupancy)
*	Place a few crates and supplies (gives appearance of active use)
Communication plan:
*	When you return to Haven, you'll inform Laurana of the asset
*	She can send operatives to establish operations
*	Grimbold will serve as the on-site contact
 
MEETING GRIMBOLD - EVENING
Thordin takes you to meet Grimbold Ironfoot at a dockside tavern. He's a 
stocky dwarf in his seventies, with a gray beard and sharp eyes that miss 
nothing.
"Thordin Ironhelm," he greets your companion warmly. "Heard you 
were in town. And these must be the folk who pulled my workers 
out from under that wagon."
Word has spread fast.
"Aye," Thordin confirms. "They've just acquired Warehouse 47. Need 
someone to maintain it, handle commercial inquiries, keep it 
secure. Thought of you immediately."
Grimbold listens as you explain the arrangement: official caretaker, legitimate 
front, but also understanding that the building serves... other purposes. You 
don't mention "resistance" directly, but Grimbold's no fool.
"So you want someone who can keep his mouth shut, handle 
legitimate business, and look the other way when necessary?" he 
summarizes.
"Exactly," Kessa confirms.
Grimbold considers, then nods. "30 gold per month, plus I get a room 
on the second floor for my own use. I maintain the building, handle 
rental inquiries, keep watch, and I don't ask questions about who 
comes and goes at odd hours. Deal?"
"Deal," you agree. It's fair-360 gold per year plus the 50 gp in taxes means 
the warehouse costs you 410 gp annually, but Haven will likely cover most of 
that through operational funds.
You shake hands. "We'll be leaving Palanthas in a day or two. When 
we return to Haven, we'll send word through appropriate channels. 
Expect contact within a month."
"Understood," Grimbold says. "And listen-what you did today saving 
those workers? That matters here. Dock folk remember. You ever 
need anything in Palanthas, you ask for Grimbold Ironfoot. I'll 
make it happen."
 
EVENING AT THE GOLDEN GRIFFIN - FINAL 
PALANTHAS NIGHT
You return to the inn as darkness falls. Miri serves another excellent dinner-
the four of you have become valued customers.
Inventory of Palanthas accomplishments:
*	? Helm of Kharas delivered (3,000 gp earned, split three ways = 1,000 
gp each)
*	? Historical documents donated (500 gp reward, split = 250 gp each)
*	? Magical jewelry identified (keeping rings, selling rest for ~300 gp 
each)
*	? Warehouse 47 acquired and secured
*	? Caretaker hired (Grimbold Ironfoot)
*	? Goodwill established with city authorities
*	? Cyrus found redemption and purpose
Updated party funds:
*	Johannes: ~5,800 gp
*	Kessa: ~5,730 gp
*	Cyrus: ~5,730 gp
New assets:
*	Warehouse 47 (valued ~5,000+ gp, strategic location in Palanthas)
*	Ring of Protection (party resource, not yet attuned)
*	Ring of Feather Falling (party resource, not yet attuned)
*	Goodwill with Palanthas authorities
 
CYRUS - THAT EVENING
After dinner, Cyrus sits with you on the inn's balcony, looking out over 
Palanthas's lights.
"I want to thank you, Johannes," he says quietly. "For everything. For 
not trying to make it easier than it was. For letting me carry the 
weight. For... being there when I found a way to bear it."
He looks at his hands-the ones that crawled under stone to save a child.
"I'll never forget the five hundred forty-seven. They're part of me 
now, forever. But today I learned something: I don't have to let 
them define me. I can honor their sacrifice by saving others. Eleven 
today. Eleven tomorrow. As many as I can, for as long as I live."
"That's what a healer does. We don't count the dead. We save the 
living."
He stands, clasps your shoulder. "Thank you, brother. For helping me 
remember who I am."
 
THE NEXT DAY - PREPARING TO LEAVE
Morning brings final preparations:
Resupply:
*	Potions restocked (each person gets healing potions, 50 gp each spent)
*	Rations for the journey back to Haven (1 week supply)
*	Any personal purchases (rope, equipment, etc.)
Magical item distribution:
*	Ring of Protection: Offered to the group. Who should attune?
*	Ring of Feather Falling: Offered to the group. Who should attune?
Thordin's farewell: The dwarf is staying in Palanthas for a few more days 
before heading back to Thorbardin.
"It's been an honor working with you," he says sincerely. "If you ever 
need a delver or if you find more artifacts worth recovering, you 
know how to reach me."
He hands you a contact token-a small stone carved with runes. "Show this 
to any dwarf in Thorbardin or send it with a message. I'll respond."
You shake hands all around. A professional partnership has become genuine 
friendship.
 
DEPARTURE - LATE MORNING
The four of you (you, Kessa, Cyrus, and your packs) head for Palanthas's south 
gate, the same one you entered through.
The guard captain recognizes you. "Safe travels, friends. Come back 
anytime. Palanthas could use more people like you."
You pass through the gates, leaving the great city behind. The road to Haven 
stretches ahead-about a week's journey through Solamnic territory, back to 
the hidden resistance base where Laurana and your companions wait.
 
THE JOURNEY HOME - SUMMARY
The return trip is peaceful:
*	Good weather, clear roads
*	No significant encounters
*	Time to rest, recover, and reflect
*	Cyrus seems genuinely at peace, joking and smiling again
*	Kessa is already planning how Haven can use Warehouse 47
*	You carry the weight of command, but lighter now with Cyrus restored
Seven days of travel, camping under stars, the rhythm of the road.
 
ARRIVAL AT HAVEN - ONE WEEK LATER
You crest the final ridge and see the hidden valley that houses Haven. The 
resistance base looks the same as when you left-small, concealed, but alive 
with purpose.
Scouts recognize you immediately and signal safe passage.
Commander Laurana meets you at the entrance, flanked by her staff. She 
takes one look at your group and smiles.
"Welcome back, Commander Constantinius. Brother Cyrus, Kessa. 
You've been gone three weeks. I trust it was productive?"
"Very," you confirm. "We have much to report."
 
DEBRIEFING - THAT AFTERNOON
In Haven's command center, you lay out everything:
Mission outcomes:
*	Thoradin's Hall delved successfully (no casualties)
*	Helm of Kharas recovered and delivered (3,000 gp earned)
*	Historical documents donated to Great Library (goodwill established)
*	Pre-Cataclysm property secured in Palanthas (Warehouse 47)
*	Caretaker hired, facility available for resistance operations
*	Goodwill established with Palanthas authorities through rescue 
operation
Laurana listens carefully, occasionally asking clarifying questions. When you 
finish, she sits back with an impressed expression.
"Exceptional work. You went for a simple artifact recovery and 
came back with strategic assets in Palanthas, financial resources, 
and-" she looks at Cyrus specifically "-renewed purpose."
She addresses Cyrus: "Brother, you look... different. Better. Are you 
well?"
Cyrus meets her eyes steadily. "I am, Commander. I won't claim to be 
healed-the weight of Flotsam will stay with me. But I've learned to 
carry it as purpose rather than just guilt. I'm ready to serve again."
Laurana nods, satisfied. "Good. Because we have work to do. The 
Dragon Army has been quiet since Flotsam-regrouping, 
reassessing. But intelligence suggests they're planning something 
significant. We'll need everyone at their best."
She looks at all three of you. "Take a few days to rest, resupply, and 
settle back in. Then we'll discuss next steps."
 
EVENING AT HAVEN - FULL CIRCLE
That night, sitting around Haven's communal fire, you realize how far you've 
come:
Johannes: Level 8 warlock/fighter, commander of resistance operations, 
owner of property in Palanthas, bearer of a demon's curse but still fighting for 
freedom
Kessa: Trusted companion, skilled operative, partner in multiple successful 
missions, survivor of impossible odds
Cyrus: Healer, servant of Mishakal, bearer of terrible knowledge but renewed 
in purpose, no longer defined by what he destroyed but by what he saves
The campaign continues. The Dragon Army remains a threat. Johannes's 
patron still demands tribute in nine months. The war is far from over.
But tonight, you're home. You're safe. And you're together.
 
END OF SESSION
Major accomplishments:
*	Successful delve and artifact recovery
*	Strategic asset acquired (Warehouse 47)
*	Cyrus's redemption arc completed (profoundly)
*	Financial stability achieved (~5,800 gp each)
*	New contacts and goodwill established
*	Party stronger and more unified
Character development:
*	Cyrus transformed from guilt-ridden to purposeful
*	Johannes demonstrated leadership and compassion
*	Party bonds deepened through shared experience
Next session possibilities:
*	New resistance missions from Laurana
*	Investigation of Dragon Army's next move
*	Johannes's patron quest (9 months until tribute due)
*	Something lighter again, or back to main campaign?
