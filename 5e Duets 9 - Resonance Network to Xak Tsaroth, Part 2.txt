PASTED
Most recent mission log: 
I'd like to visit Kaladin to work on some enchantment work I would like for him 
to begin working on. We'll return to Haven for mission briefing when we're 
finished.
Dec 10
I'll help you visit Kaladin at his workshop. Let me set the scene.
 
Haven - Three Days After Return
The party has had time to rest, resupply, and catch their breath after the 
intensive coastal operations. Johannes has been thinking about the magical 
items they've acquired and some ideas he'd like to explore with Kaladin's 
expertise.
The artificer's workshop is located in a converted smithy on the eastern edge 
of Haven's main compound. Even from outside, you can hear the 
rhythmic tap-tap-tap of careful metalwork and smell the distinctive scents of 
hot metal, arcane reagents, and ozone.
When you enter, Kaladin is bent over a workbench, examining what appears to 
be a damaged Dragon Army breastplate through an enchanted loupe. He's a 
lean human in his mid-40s, with burn scars on his forearms and perpetually 
soot-stained hands. His leather apron is covered in pockets containing various 
tools and components.
He looks up, recognizes Johannes, and sets down his work. "Ah, the hero of 
Pax Tharkas returns. I heard about Flotsam-impressive work, though I 
imagine it wasn't pretty." He wipes his hands on a rag. "What brings you to my 
corner of Haven? Looking for repairs, modifications, or something more... 
creative?"
He gestures to a clear area of his workshop where he typically consults with 
clients.
What would Johannes like to discuss with Kaladin? Are there specific 
items you want enchanted, modified, or created? Or perhaps you're interested 
in what services he offers?
Clarification: We need to visit Master Artificer Keldin in Ak-Thyln (see Aboleth 
reconnaissance mission prep
Dec 10
You're absolutely right - my apologies! Master Artificer Keldin in Ak-Thyln, 
not Kaladin in Haven. Let me correct that.
 
Journey to Ak-Thyln
The party sets out from Haven on the two-day journey to Ak-Thyln. The region 
shows clear signs of recovery since the Dragon Army was driven out - farms 
are being rebuilt, refugees are returning, and there's cautious optimism in the 
air.
Ak-Thyln itself is a modest trading town of about 3,000 people, nestled in 
rolling hills with good access to regional trade routes. The town has a grateful 
relationship with the party - after all, you prevented a Dragon Army invasion 
fleet from landing on their shores.
Master Artificer Keldin's Workshop
You find Keldin's workshop in the craftsman's quarter - a two-story stone 
building with reinforced doors and windows that show the faint shimmer of 
protective wards. Smoke rises from multiple chimneys, and you can hear the 
hum of arcane machinery inside.
When you enter, Keldin looks up from a workbench where he's etching runes 
into a steel bracer. He's a stocky dwarf with a magnificently braided beard 
adorned with small metal clasps, and he wears heavy protective goggles 
pushed up on his forehead.
"Well, well! If it isn't the champions who saved our coast!" He sets down his 
tools with a grin. "Johannes, Kessa, Brother Cyrus - word of your Flotsam 
operation reached us. Sinking fifteen Dragon Army ships? That's work worthy 
of song." He wipes his hands on his leather apron. "What can I do for you? 
Repairs? Enchantments? Or perhaps something more ambitious?"
What enchantment work does Johannes want to discuss with 
Master Keldin?
Something relatively revolutionary. The three of us are often engaged in 
highly delicate operations that require efficient, effective communications that 
are discrete. I am looking for you to try and craft something that could work 
collaboratively among the three of us that performs the following tasks:
1) Silent communication (either something written like Message, Sending 
Stone) or telepathic between three separate individuals (or more if needed) 2) 
If possible, scrying of some sort or the ability to transmit images or vision at 
distance 3) Highly portable, cannot be fixed to specific locations 4) Scalable, 
meaning that above the initial 3 devices, additional devices could be created 
and added into the network
Cost really isn't an issue. I can leave my entire gold account to cover initial 
development costs, with the provision that should you be able to craft what 
we are looking for, I will cover remaining costs as I may. I know this is 
groundbreaking work and may take years to complete, but if the task can 
begin, my gratitude will know no bounds.

Dec 10
Keldin's eyes widen as you lay out the specifications. He sets down his tools 
completely and listens with intense focus, occasionally stroking his beard as he 
processes each requirement.
When you finish, there's a long moment of silence. Then he slowly rises from 
his stool and walks to a locked cabinet, retrieving a leather-bound journal 
filled with diagrams and notes. He flips through several pages before returning 
to the workbench.
"You're not asking for something revolutionary, Johannes. You're asking for 
something unprecedented." He taps the journal. "But not impossible. Let me 
break down what you're describing..."
He pulls out a piece of parchment and begins sketching as he talks:
"THE TECHNICAL CHALLENGES:"
"Silent communication between three individuals - This is actually 
the easiest part. Sending Stones exist, Message cantrips exist, even items that 
replicate Rary's Telepathic Bond. The challenge is making it always 
available and instantaneous rather than limited uses per day."
"Scrying or image transmission - This is where it gets complex. Scrying 
requires a 5th-level spell slot, significant components, and targets can resist. 
What you're describing is more like... arcane surveillance. Seeing through 
another person's eyes, or transmitting what you see. That's 6th-level magic 
territory - True Seeing, aspects of Arcane Eye."
"Highly portable and not location-fixed - This rules out permanent 
circles or anchored items. We're talking personal equipment. Rings, amulets, 
earpieces, perhaps integrated into existing magical items."
"Scalable network - Now THIS is the truly groundbreaking part. You're not 
asking for paired items. You're asking for a network where any device can 
communicate with any other device, and new devices can be added. That 
requires... a central arcane matrix? Or each item containing a fragment of a 
linked whole?"
He sets down his charcoal and looks at you seriously.
"Here's what I can tell you:"
"FEASIBILITY:"
"Phase 1 - Basic Network (6-8 months, 3,000-4,000 gp):
*	Three linked items (likely rings or earpieces) that allow silent 
communication between all three wearers
*	Always-on connection, no daily use limits
*	Range: roughly 1 mile, possibly extendable to 5 miles with refinement
*	Text-based or telepathic speech
Phase 2 - Image Transmission (additional 8-12 months, 4,000-
6,000 gp):
*	Upgrade existing items to allow brief visual sharing (think: 1 minute of 
seeing through another's eyes, 3-4 times per day)
*	Not true scrying (no resistance check, target must be willing network 
member)
*	Requires significant enchantment research and rare components
Phase 3 - Scalability (additional 6-10 months, variable cost):
*	Develop 'master schema' that allows creation of additional network 
items
*	Each additional item: 1,000-1,500 gp in materials and labor
*	Maximum network size: Unknown, but likely 10-12 devices before 
magical interference becomes problematic"
He leans back and crosses his arms.
"Total timeline: 2-3 years for full implementation. Total cost: 10,000-15,000 
gp, possibly more depending on component availability and research 
setbacks."
"But here's the thing, Johannes - if this works, you're not just commissioning 
magical items. You're pioneering an entirely new category of collaborative 
enchantment. The military applications alone... Haven's resistance could use 
this. The Palanthas city guard. Any coordinated force."
He looks at you carefully. "I'm interested. This is the kind of work that defines 
a master artificer's career. But I need to be clear about expectations:"
"MY TERMS:"
1.	Initial development payment: 1,500 gp - Covers materials, 
research time, component acquisition for Phase 1
2.	Progress updates every two months - You'll know if I'm hitting 
obstacles or making breakthroughs
3.	Prototype testing with your party - When Phase 1 is ready, you 
field-test it and report back on problems
4.	Intellectual ownership - I retain the right to craft additional sets for 
other clients (primarily Haven/resistance forces), but you get first 
production and discounted rates on future items
5.	No guarantees on timeline - If research hits a wall, it hits a wall. I 
won't take your money for impossible work, but breakthroughs take 
time
He extends a soot-stained hand.
"Do we have an accord? And more importantly - do you have a name for this 
project? Every great innovation deserves a proper title."
How does Johannes respond? And what would you like to call this 
network system?
You're creating it; you get the credit. I am just helping in the defray of costs 
for development. I trust in your good judgement. In fact, the less visible I am 
in the creation of this, the less likely this might cause problems for you. If no 
one knows I am involved, the provenance causes less problems for you with 
our external enemies. And the initial payment, like I said," I hand over a large 
bag filled with platinum pieces that leaves me with the equivalent of 500 gp, 
"you need this a lot more than I do, though if I am right, and this system 
works, money will never be an issue for you, or for the fifth descendants of 
your fifth descendants.
Dec 10
Keldin takes the bag, weighs it in his hand for a moment, then sets it down on 
the workbench with a heavy thunk. He opens it, sees the platinum pieces 
gleaming inside, and his expression shifts from professional interest to 
something approaching awe.
He counts quickly - nearly 5,300 gold pieces worth of platinum.
The dwarf is silent for a long moment, then carefully closes the bag and looks 
at you with an intensity that wasn't there before.
"Johannes Constantinius." His voice is quieter now, more personal. "I've 
crafted items for nobles, for generals, for merchant princes who threw gold 
around like copper. But I've never had someone hand me their entire fortune 
and say 'make something that matters.'"
He reaches out and grips your forearm in the traditional dwarven clasp of 
respect.
"You're right about the visibility - if Dragon Army intelligence learns you're 
funding revolutionary communication magic, they'll move heaven and earth to 
stop it or steal it. So here's what we'll do:"
"THE ARRANGEMENT:"
"This project will be known as The Resonance Network - my research, my 
innovation, funded by 'anonymous resistance benefactors.' Your name stays 
out of it completely. When Haven asks where the funding came from, I'll say 
'liberated Dragon Army gold' or 'grateful coastal merchants.' No one needs to 
know."
"As for descendants of descendants..." He chuckles darkly. "If this works, aye, 
there'll be wealth. But more importantly, there'll be legacy. Every coordinated 
resistance operation, every life saved by better communication, every tactical 
advantage... that's what matters."
He moves to a secure lockbox built into the wall, places the platinum inside, 
and locks it with both key and a whispered command word.
"The funds are secure. I'll draw what I need for components and research, and 
I'll keep meticulous records. Every two months, I'll send word to Haven - 
progress reports, obstacles, breakthroughs. You'll know how your investment 
fares."
He returns to the workbench and makes a note in his journal:
Project Resonance - Phase 1 Initiated Anonymous Benefactor - 5,300 gp 
received Goal: Networked silent communication for resistance operations 
Timeline: 6-8 months to prototype
Then he looks up at you with a craftsman's fire in his eyes.
"I'll start immediately. First step is acquiring a pair of Sending Stones to study 
their enchantment matrix, then researching modifications to the bond 
between paired items. I know a gem merchant in Palanthas who deals in the 
right kind of crystals..."
He pauses, then adds more quietly: "Johannes, I don't know what drives a 
man to give away everything he has for a project that might not succeed, that 
might take years, and that he won't even take credit for. But I'll honor that 
trust. You've given me the chance to create something genuinely new in a 
world that desperately needs it."
"When the prototype is ready - and it will be ready - I'll send word through 
Haven. You'll be the first to test it."
Kessa and Cyrus's Reactions:
Kessa has been uncharacteristically quiet during this exchange. Now she 
speaks up: "Johannes... that was everything. You just... you're sure about 
this?"
Cyrus is looking at you with something between concern and understanding. 
"Brother, you've just invested your entire fortune in hope. That's... that's either 
the most faithful thing I've ever seen, or the most reckless." A pause. "Probably 
both."
Is there anything else Johannes wants to discuss with Keldin 
before departing? Any specific features or concerns to raise about 
the Resonance Network? And how does he respond to his 
companions' reactions?
Just anonymous benefactors. This is business; let's keep the politics out of it.
Dec 10
Keldin nods approvingly, catching the correction immediately.
"Aye, you're right. Anonymous benefactors - no mention of resistance, Haven, 
or any particular cause. Just merchants, grateful townsfolk, investors who see 
the potential. Clean money for clean research."
He makes a quick annotation in his journal, crossing out a word and replacing 
it.
"Better for everyone that way. If this works, the applications go far beyond any 
one conflict. Trading companies, exploration guilds, city watches... the market 
is vast once the concept is proven."
He closes the journal with finality. "Business terms agreed. I'll keep politics 
and provenance out of my records and correspondence. You'll hear from me in 
two months with the first progress report."
The dwarf extends his hand once more - this time a simple handshake rather 
than the formal clasp. "Thank you for your confidence in my work. I won't 
squander it."
 
Outside Keldin's Workshop
As the three of you step back into the afternoon sun of Ak-Thyln's craftsman 
quarter, Kessa is still processing what just happened.
"So... we're back to traveling money and whatever we earn on the next job." 
She's not complaining, just stating facts. "Good thing we've got that warehouse 
in Palanthas as an asset."
Cyrus is quieter, thoughtful. "That was your entire reserve, Johannes. 
Everything you've saved. For something that might not work for years." He 
looks at you. "You saw something worth betting everything on. I respect that."
Then, with a slight smile: "Though I notice you kept back 500 gold. At least we 
can afford decent lodging on the way back to Haven."
The return journey to Haven is two days. Do you want to:
1.	Head straight back for the mission briefing with Commander Laurana
2.	Handle any other business in Ak-Thyln first
3.	Discuss the Resonance Network investment with your companions 
during travel
What's Johannes's priority?
Wait, I gave my money, but not Kessa's or Cyrus's, right?
Dec 10
Absolutely correct! My apologies for the confusion.
Johannes gave his ~5,300 gp (keeping back 500 gp for himself), but Kessa still 
has her ~5,730 gp and Cyrus still has his ~5,730 gp.
Updated Financial Status:
*	Johannes: ~500 gp remaining
*	Kessa: ~5,730 gp (unchanged)
*	Cyrus: ~5,730 gp (unchanged)
So Kessa's comment should be more like:
"So... you're back to traveling money." She glances at you with a mix of 
concern and respect. "Cyrus and I are still flush, but you just bet everything on 
a dream. That's... bold."
Cyrus nods. "We're solid financially as a party. And if you need funds for 
anything critical before the Resonance Network pays off - or before your next 
share of mission rewards - you know we've got you covered."
Does that change anything about how Johannes wants to proceed? 
The party as a whole is still in excellent financial shape, even if 
Johannes personally is running lean for the moment.
That is exactly what I want. Having the ability to work in absolute silence, with 
dark-vision, yeah, that is what this Special Ops group has needed for a LONG 
time, so we might as well get the ball rolling, especially since I recalled the 
offer being proffered in a previous mission. Now, let's head back to Haven and 
see what lies in store.
OOC - You can either introduce one of the formal mission briefs in the Project 
Library, or come up with something completely unique. But again, NO 
SPOILERS. Just let it flow.
Dec 10
Return to Haven - Two Days Later
The journey back is uneventful, giving the party time to rest and reflect. 
Johannes is noticeably lighter - not just in coin purse, but in demeanor. He's 
made a long-term investment in capability that could transform how the party 
operates. The others respect the decision, even if it was bold.
 
Haven - Commander Laurana's Command Tent
You're ushered in shortly after arriving. Laurana is studying a large map of the 
region, with various markers indicating Dragon Army positions, resistance 
cells, and strategic locations. She looks up as you enter.
"Welcome back. I trust your business in Ak-Thyln was productive?" She 
doesn't press for details - she's learned that sometimes the best commanders 
don't ask too many questions about how their best operatives prepare.
She gestures to the map. "We've had an interesting development. About a 
week ago, one of our scouts reported unusual activity in the Dargaard 
Mountains, roughly 80 miles northeast of here."
She points to a region of forbidding peaks marked with old fortification 
symbols.
"The area is dominated by Dargaard Keep - an ancient fortress that's been 
abandoned since the Cataclysm. The place has an... ugly reputation. Stories of 
undead, curses, that sort of thing. Locals won't go near it."
She looks up at you. "Three days ago, a Dragon Army patrol - small unit, 
maybe 15-20 soldiers - was spotted heading into the mountains toward the 
keep. They haven't come back out."
"Now, normally I'd write that off as stupid commanders getting their people 
killed by whatever haunts that place. But our intelligence suggests the Dragon 
Army has been searching for something in pre-Cataclysm ruins. After what 
you found with that aboleth's hoard - ancient deeds, historical documents - 
I'm wondering if they're looking for similar assets."
She taps the map. "I need to know three things:
1.	What happened to that Dragon Army patrol? Did they die? Did 
they find something? Are they still there?
2.	What are they looking for? If the Dragon Army thinks something in 
Dargaard Keep is worth the risk, we need to know what it is.
3.	Can we deny them the asset? If there's something valuable there - 
magical, strategic, historical - can we secure it or destroy it before they 
mount a larger operation?"
Laurana crosses her arms. "I won't lie to you - Dargaard Keep's reputation 
is bad. The Cataclysm hit that place hard, and the Knight who held it... well, 
the stories say he died badly and didn't stay dead. But if the Dragon Army 
thinks it's worth investigating, we can't afford to ignore it."
She looks at each of you in turn. "This is reconnaissance first, intervention 
second. Get in, find out what happened to that patrol, assess what they were 
after, and report back. If you can secure or deny whatever asset they were 
seeking, do it. But don't die trying - information is more valuable than heroics 
right now."
"Questions?"
What does Johannes want to know before accepting this mission?
What can you tell us about the Keep, and this Knight you mention?
Dec 10
Laurana nods, clearly expecting this question. She moves to a side table and 
retrieves a worn leather folder containing historical documents.
"What I can tell you comes from pre-Cataclysm records and local legend - 
which means some of it is fact, some is embellishment, and some might be 
complete fiction. But here's what we know:"
She spreads out a few aged documents and a rough sketch of the keep's 
exterior.
"DARGAARD KEEP - THE FACTS:"
"Built approximately 400 years ago, Dargaard Keep was a major fortress 
controlling the mountain passes in this region. Strategically positioned, well-
fortified, garrison of about 200 soldiers at its height. It was the seat of a 
Knight of Solamnia named Lord Soth."
She pauses, her expression darkening slightly.
"Soth was, by all accounts, a exemplary knight. Honorable, skilled in battle, 
beloved by his men. Rose quickly through the ranks. But something happened 
in the years before the Cataclysm - the records are fragmentary, but they 
suggest scandal. An affair, accusations of betrayal, some kind of tragic incident 
involving his wife."
"THE CATACLYSM:"
"When the Cataclysm struck, Dargaard Keep was hit hard. The entire 
structure was partially destroyed - fires, collapse, mass casualties. According 
to legend, Lord Soth and his knights died in the catastrophe, but the manner 
of their deaths was... cursed somehow. The stories say Soth was on a mission 
of redemption when the Cataclysm struck, but failed - and was condemned for 
that failure."
She looks up at you. "Here's where fact ends and legend begins."
"THE LEGEND - LORD SOTH, DEATH KNIGHT:"
"The locals claim Lord Soth didn't stay dead. They say he rose as something 
worse - a death knight, bound to the keep by his failures and guilt. The 
stories describe him as a figure in blackened armor, burning with cold fire, 
commanding undead servants."
"Travelers who've gotten too close to the keep report hearing strange sounds 
at night - weeping, screaming, the clash of phantom battles. Some claim to see 
lights in the towers. Most who venture too close don't come back."
Cyrus interjects quietly: "Death knights are... they're real, but rare. Paladins or 
knights who commit terrible betrayals and are cursed by the gods themselves. 
They retain their martial skill and gain powerful necromantic abilities. If Soth 
truly became one, he'd be extremely dangerous - immune to most magic, 
capable of commanding undead, and nearly impossible to destroy 
permanently."
Laurana nods. "That's what concerns me. If the Dragon Army thinks they 
can negotiate with or control whatever's in that keep, they're either desperate 
or they know something we don't."
"WHAT WE DON'T KNOW:"
She spreads her hands. "We don't know if Soth truly exists, or if he's just a 
story to keep people away. We don't know what the keep's interior looks like 
after 300+ years. We don't know what the Dragon Army was specifically 
seeking - magical items, strategic position, alliance with undead forces, 
something else entirely."
She looks at you seriously. "And we don't know what happened to that 15-20 
soldier patrol. Did they get killed by whatever haunts the place? Are they holed 
up inside, trapped? Did they find what they were looking for and leave by 
another route?"
"PRACTICAL INFORMATION:"
"The keep is roughly 80 miles northeast - three to four days' travel through 
increasingly rough terrain. The last 20 miles are mountainous and difficult. 
There's a small village called Dargaard Village about 5 miles from the keep - 
maybe 200 people, mostly farmers and herders. They might have more recent 
information about activity in the area."
"Weather's been clear lately, so travel shouldn't be difficult until you hit the 
mountains. The keep itself sits on a high promontory - defensible position, but 
that also means it's visible for miles. Hard to approach without being seen."
She closes the folder. "That's everything we have. Incomplete, unreliable, but 
it's what we've got."
Kessa speaks up: "So we're walking into a potentially cursed fortress that 
might house an undead death knight, looking for a missing Dragon Army 
patrol that was searching for... something. And we don't know if the death 
knight is real, what they were looking for, or if the whole area is just a 
convenient trap."
Laurana's expression is grim but honest. "Yes. That's exactly what I'm asking 
you to do. Which is why I'm asking you - you've handled worse odds and come 
back with intelligence we needed."
Johannes, do you have more questions, or are you ready to 
accept/decline this mission?
I want all the details about death knights and what kinds of weapons, spells, 
etc. would have impact on it. I am leery of going anywhere where we have no 
ability to control events or defend ourselves.
Dec 10
Laurana nods approvingly. "Smart. Going in blind against something like that 
is suicide. Let me get Brother Marius - he's our expert on undead and holy 
lore."
She steps outside and returns a few minutes later with an elderly cleric 
wearing the robes of Paladine. Brother Marius is thin, scholarly, with ink-
stained fingers and the careful manner of someone who's spent decades 
studying rather than fighting.
"Commander Laurana tells me you need information on death knights. Wise - 
they're among the most dangerous undead in existence." He pulls out a scroll 
and spreads it on the table.
"DEATH KNIGHTS - WHAT THEY ARE:"
"A death knight is a fallen paladin or knight, cursed by divine powers for 
committing an act of terrible betrayal or evil. They retain their martial 
prowess, gain significant necromantic powers, and are bound to a specific 
location or quest. They're intelligent, tactical, and utterly relentless."
"COMBAT CAPABILITIES:"
Brother Marius ticks off points on his fingers:
"Martial Prowess: They fight as well as they did in life - often better. Expect 
master-level swordsmanship, heavy armor, mounted combat if they have an 
undead steed. Lord Soth, if he exists, was reportedly a Knight of Solamnia - 
which means exceptional training.
Hellfire Orb: Once per day, they can create a sphere of magical fire that 
explodes in a 20-foot radius. Devastating damage - 7d6 fire plus 7d6 necrotic. 
This is their most dangerous direct attack ability.
Spellcasting: They retain any paladin spells they had in life, but twisted to 
dark purposes. Expect Command, Dispel Magic, Hellish Rebuke, possibly 
more powerful spells depending on their level when they fell.
Frightening Presence: Their mere presence can inspire supernatural 
terror. Weak-willed individuals may flee or become paralyzed with fear.
Undead Command: They can control lesser undead within their domain - 
skeletons, zombies, wraiths, specters. If Dargaard Keep is truly cursed, Soth 
could have an army of servants."
"DEFENSES & IMMUNITIES:"
This is where Brother Marius's expression becomes grave:
"Magic Resistance: Advantage on saving throws against spells and magical 
effects. Your standard combat magic is less effective.
Damage Immunities: Completely immune to necrotic and poison damage. 
Cannot be poisoned.
Damage Resistances: Resistant to non-magical weapon damage. 
You need magical weapons to hurt them effectively.
Condition Immunities: Cannot be charmed, exhausted, frightened, 
paralyzed, or poisoned. Standard control effects won't work.
Undead Nature: They don't need air, food, drink, or sleep. You can't outlast 
them or siege them out.
Regeneration: Some death knights regenerate health over time unless 
damaged by radiant or holy sources."
"WEAKNESSES - HOW TO FIGHT THEM:"
Brother Marius's tone becomes more hopeful:
"Radiant Damage: This is your best weapon. Holy magic, divine smites, 
anything channeling positive energy or godly power. Brother Cyrus's Sacred 
Flame, his channel divinity - these are your primary offensive tools.
Magic Weapons: Your enchanted weapons will be effective where mundane 
ones fail. Johannes, your eldritch blasts count as magical damage - you can 
hurt it.
Turn Undead: A powerful cleric can potentially turn a death knight, forcing 
it to flee. It's difficult - they have strong will - but possible. Cyrus, your Turn 
Undead feature would be critical.
Dispel Magic: Their spell effects can be countered or dispelled like any other 
magic.
Holy Ground: They're weakened or repelled by consecrated ground or holy 
relics. If you can lure them onto blessed territory, their power diminishes.
Destroy the Curse: This is theoretical, but if you could discover 
the source of their curse - what betrayal bound them - it might be possible to 
break the curse and destroy them permanently. This would require 
investigation and divine intervention."
"TACTICAL RECOMMENDATIONS:"
Brother Marius looks at each of you:
"Brother Cyrus is your MVP in this scenario. His radiant damage, Turn 
Undead, and divine magic are your primary offensive and defensive tools. 
Keep him alive at all costs.
Avoid direct confrontation if possible. Death knights are nearly 
unbeatable in straight combat unless you significantly outnumber them or 
have powerful divine support. Reconnaissance and avoidance should be your 
priority.
Use magical weapons exclusively. Non-magical weapons are nearly 
useless.
Spread out during combat. That Hellfire Orb has a 20-foot blast radius. If 
you're clustered, it can wipe your entire party in one attack.
Flee if necessary. There is no shame in retreating from a death knight. 
They're apex predators among undead. Getting intelligence and surviving is 
worth more than dying heroically.
Look for the patrol's remains. If the Dragon Army soldiers died fighting a 
death knight, their bodies will tell you how the combat went and what killed 
them. That's valuable tactical information."
"ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:"
Brother Marius produces a small wooden case. Inside are three vials of 
glowing silver liquid and three small holy symbols.
"Holy Water - three vials. Deals 2d6 radiant damage to undead on a direct 
hit. Not much, but it might buy you a critical moment.
Blessed Symbols of Paladine - three amulets. Not magical items, but 
blessed by the church. They won't protect you from harm, but they might 
provide advantage on saving throws against fear effects or undead command. 
Wear them openly.
These are yours for the mission. Consider them insurance."
He closes the case and hands it to Cyrus. "May Paladine watch over you. Death 
knights are... they're tragedies, in a sense. Once-noble warriors corrupted and 
cursed. But that doesn't make them less dangerous."
 
Laurana watches this exchange, then adds: "Based on this information, my 
orders remain the same: reconnaissance first. If Lord Soth is real and you 
encounter him, your priority is to escape with intelligence, not to fight him. 
We need to know what the Dragon Army was after, not dead heroes."
She looks at Johannes specifically. "Does this information change your 
assessment of the mission? Are you willing to proceed, or do you need 
different resources?"
Johannes, how do you respond? Do you want to:
1.	Accept the mission with current resources
2.	Request additional support (more clerics, more holy items, backup 
team)
3.	Decline the mission as too dangerous
4.	Propose an alternative approach
I am good. Thoughts? Kessa? Cyrus?
Dec 10
Kessa's Assessment:
Kessa has been listening intently, her expression thoughtful. She leans back 
against the table and crosses her arms.
"Reconnaissance I can do. That's what I'm good at. Stealth, observation, 
getting in and out without being seen." She taps the map. "The problem is if 
we get spotted. Death knight or not, we're talking about a fortress - limited 
exits, defensive terrain, potentially hostile undead. If things go sideways, 
extraction becomes... complicated."
She looks at the blessed symbols and holy water. "That said, we've handled 
worse odds. The aboleth, the Dragon Army fleet, Pax Tharkas. We plan well, 
we adapt, we survive." A slight smile. "And honestly? Finding out what the 
Dragon Army wants badly enough to risk a cursed fortress? That's worth the 
danger. If they're desperate enough to go there, it's probably something 
we really don't want them to have."
She nods once. "I'm in. But we do this smart - scout the village first, gather 
local intel, approach the keep carefully, and have an escape plan before we go 
inside."
 
Cyrus's Assessment:
Brother Cyrus is quiet for a long moment, his hand resting on the wooden case 
containing the holy water and blessed symbols. When he speaks, his voice is 
measured and serious.
"I won't lie - this terrifies me. Death knights are..." He pauses, choosing his 
words carefully. "They're what happens when someone with power and 
purpose falls completely. They're warnings. Cautionary tales made flesh and 
darkness."
He looks up at you and Kessa. "But that's also why we should go. If Lord Soth 
is real, he's suffering an eternal curse - trapped, corrupted, unable to find 
peace. And if the Dragon Army thinks they can use him or whatever's in that 
keep, they'll bring even more suffering to the world."
His expression firms with resolve. "Mishakal teaches that healing isn't always 
about mending flesh - sometimes it's about preventing greater wounds. If we 
can stop the Dragon Army from gaining whatever they're after, we prevent 
untold casualties down the line."
He picks up one of the blessed symbols, examining it. "And practically 
speaking? Brother Marius is right - I'm the key to our survival if we encounter 
undead. Turn Undead, radiant damage, healing to keep us mobile. I can do 
this."
A pause, then quieter: "After Flotsam, after the dock rescue... I understand 
now that sometimes the only way to save lives is to face the darkness directly. 
I'm ready."
He looks at Johannes. "I'm with you. But Kessa's right - we need a solid plan 
and clear escape routes. Going in blind would be foolish."
 
Laurana's Conclusion:
Commander Laurana has been watching this exchange with approval. "Good. 
You're thinking like professionals, not glory-seekers."
She pulls out a supply requisition form. "You'll have standard mission 
support: rations for two weeks, rope, climbing gear, torches, anything 
reasonable you need from our stores. We'll also provide three Potions of 
Healing each - I want you to have emergency resources."
"Timeline: Take three to four days to reach Dargaard Village, gather local 
intelligence, assess the situation. Another day to scout the keep's exterior. 
Then you make the call on whether to enter or report back for additional 
resources. Don't take unnecessary risks."
She looks each of you in the eye. "You've earned my trust through consistent 
results and good judgment. I'm trusting you to use that judgment here. If the 
situation is beyond your capabilities, retreat. We can always mount a larger 
operation later."
"Any final questions before you prepare to depart?"
Johannes, are you ready to:
1.	Accept the mission and begin preparations
2.	Ask any final questions
3.	Request specific additional equipment or resources
1.	Let's skip to the trip, unless someone else needs or would like 
something.
Dec 10
Kessa speaks up: "Actually, one thing - Commander, do we have any maps 
of the keep's interior? Even old pre-Cataclysm floor plans? If we're going in, 
knowing the layout could save our lives."
Laurana shakes her head. "Nothing detailed. The keep was a private holding - 
Lord Soth wouldn't have shared internal layouts with the Knighthood 
archives. Best we have is the exterior sketch and basic knowledge that it's a 
fortified keep - likely great hall, towers, dungeons, lord's quarters. Standard 
fortress architecture."
Cyrus: "I'll prepare Speak with Dead for the journey. If we find the Dragon 
Army patrol's remains, we might be able to question them about what they 
encountered."
Laurana nods approval. "Smart thinking. Anything else?"
Seeing no further questions, she concludes: "Report to the quartermaster for 
supplies. You can depart at first light tomorrow. May the gods watch over 
you."
 
DAY 1-3: JOURNEY TO DARGAARD MOUNTAINS
The first three days of travel are straightforward - following established roads 
northeast through rolling farmland that gradually gives way to rocky hills and 
sparse forest. The weather holds clear and cool.
As you travel, the terrain becomes progressively more desolate. Farms become 
fewer and more rundown. The few travelers you pass seem hurried, unwilling 
to make eye contact or engage in conversation. There's a palpable sense of 
unease the closer you get to the mountains.
By the afternoon of the third day, the dark peaks of the Dargaard Mountains 
loom ahead - jagged, forbidding, shrouded in perpetual mist at their heights.
DAY 4: APPROACH TO DARGAARD VILLAGE (Morning)
The village comes into view around mid-morning. It's small - maybe forty 
structures, mostly simple wooden homes and a few stone buildings. Smoke 
rises from chimneys, but the place has a quiet, subdued quality. No children 
playing in the streets. No market bustle.
And dominating the view to the north, perched on a high rocky promontory 
perhaps 5 miles distant, is Dargaard Keep.
Even from this distance, it's imposing. Dark stone towers reach toward the 
grey sky, partially collapsed but still menacing. The walls are intact in places, 
breached in others. At this distance, you can see no lights, no movement, no 
signs of life - but there's an undeniable presence to the structure. Something 
watchful.
As you enter the village, a few residents glance at you nervously, then quickly 
look away. An old woman sweeping her doorstep makes a warding gesture and 
hurries inside.
The village has a small inn - The Weary Traveler - a general store, a 
blacksmith's forge (cold, no smoke), and what appears to be a small shrine to 
Mishakal at the village center.
How do you want to approach gathering information in Dargaard 
Village? And where do you want to start?
Actually, can we clear out any unnecessary items from our Bags of Holding, 
like Lucien's body. It isn't doing us any good and should be turned over if it 
wasn't already. Also, let's liquidate any non-magical items we might still be 
carrying. I want our affairs to be as in order as possible.
Dec 10
Excellent point - let's handle housekeeping before the mission 
begins.
 
LUCIEN'S CORPSE:
You're absolutely right - that should have been handled immediately upon 
return to Haven. Let me retcon that appropriately:
When you returned to Haven after the Palanthas expedition, you turned 
Lucien's corpse over to Haven's intelligence division. They used Speak with 
Dead to extract what information they could (troop movements, command 
structure, fleet deployment schedules), then gave him a proper burial - even 
enemies deserve that dignity, and it's good policy for when Dragon Army 
prisoners see Haven treats the dead with respect.
Result: Lucien's corpse no longer in Bag of Holding, intelligence extracted 
and utilized.
 
NON-MAGICAL ITEMS TO LIQUIDATE:
Let me check what you might still be carrying from various missions:
From Lucien's Looting:
*	Command insignia & keys (turned over to Haven intelligence)
*	Maps & strategic documents (turned over to Haven intelligence)
*	Lucien's journal (turned over to Haven intelligence)
From Thoradin's Hall:
*	Shield of Thoradin's Hall (historical artifact) - Keep or sell?
*	4 military rank pins (sold in Palanthas for ~300 gp, already handled)
*	Non-magical jewelry (sold in Palanthas, already handled)
Miscellaneous:
*	Any mundane weapons, armor, or gear you're not using?
*	Trade goods or trinkets from previous adventures?
QUESTIONS:
1.	Shield of Thoradin's Hall - Do you want to:
*	Sell it in Haven (~150-200 gp, historical value)?
*	Donate it to Haven's museum/archives (goodwill, no gold)?
*	Keep it as a spare shield for emergencies?
2.	Spare equipment - Are you carrying any non-magical weapons, 
armor, or gear you'd like to liquidate before this mission?
3.	Bags of Holding inventory - Is there anything else taking up space 
that should be cleared out?
Current understanding: You want to go into Dargaard Keep as lean as 
possible - just essential gear, magical items, supplies, and no dead weight 
(literally or figuratively).
What do you want to do with the Shield and any other non-
essential items?
Keep the shield; I think at some point we will interact more directly with 
dwarves and it is a great peacemaker. Sell anything else. And let's get Kessa 
kitted up. She has the Bracers and the Rope of Entanglement. We have a 
couple of additional magic items that she could choose from; so what would 
she pick?
Dec 10
Excellent thinking on the Shield - that's solid diplomatic foresight.
 
KESSA'S MAGICAL ITEM SELECTION:
Currently available for attunement:
1.	Cloak of Displacement (Rare, Attunement) - Attackers have 
disadvantage on attack rolls against wearer
2.	Ring of Protection (Rare, Attunement) - +1 AC, +1 to all saving 
throws
3.	Ring of Feather Falling (Rare, Attunement) - No fall damage, 
descend 60 ft/round
Kessa's Current Attunements:
*	Bracers of Defense (+2 AC while wearing no armor)
*	Rope of Entanglement
*	1 open slot
 
You pull Kessa aside before departure and show her the three items.
"You've got room for one more attunement. Your call - what fits your style?"
Kessa examines each carefully, testing the weight of the rings, running her 
fingers over the shimmering fabric of the Cloak.
Her Analysis:
"The Cloak of Displacement is tempting. Disadvantage on attacks against 
me? That's survival gold, especially if we're dealing with undead that can 
swarm. But it's also visible - that shimmer effect isn't exactly stealthy."
She picks up the Ring of Protection. "This is the safe choice. +1 AC stacks 
with my Bracers, +1 to saves helps against that Hellfire Orb Brother Marius 
mentioned. Solid all-around defense."
Then she holds up the Ring of Feather Falling, a slight smile on her face. 
"But this? This is the rogue's choice. Climbing towers, escaping down cliffs, 
jumping from battlements when things go wrong. We're going to a keep on a 
high promontory - vertical terrain. This gives me mobility options you two 
don't have."
She pauses, thinking tactically. "If we need to split up for reconnaissance, or if 
we need a fast escape route, I can go places you can't. Drop down the outside 
of towers, leap across gaps, scout from high positions."
Her Decision:
"I'm taking the Ring of Feather Falling. Johannes, you and Cyrus can 
handle yourselves in a straight fight - you've got firepower and healing. What 
you need from me is reconnaissance, infiltration, and tactical flexibility. This 
ring gives me that."
She slips it on. "Besides, if Cyrus gets hit with that Hellfire Orb, his healing 
can patch him up. If I get hit, I'm probably down anyway - one more AC point 
won't save me. Better to not get hit at all by staying mobile."
Does that work for Johannes? And do you want to assign the other 
two items to anyone, or keep them available in the Bag of Holding?
 
REMAINING LIQUIDATION:
Everything else non-essential has been sold off in Haven before departure. 
Your Bags of Holding now contain only:
*	Essential adventuring gear (rope, rations, etc.)
*	Potions and consumables
*	Spare magical items (Cloak of Displacement, Ring of Protection)
*	Shield of Thoradin's Hall
*	Standard ammunition and components
Updated funds after minor sales: Johannes ~550 gp, Kessa ~5,780 
gp, Cyrus ~5,780 gp
Ready to proceed to Dargaard Village now?
Ask Cyrus the same question. Is he good? Actually, is he still carrying the 
Scepter?
Dec 10
Excellent catch - the Tempest Scepter was returned to Zeboim as 
promised after the Flotsam operation.
From the mission log: "Tempest Scepter returned to Zeboim (as promised)"
Cyrus carried it only for the fleet destruction, then you all made the journey 
back to the Temple of Zeboim and returned it to the sea goddess's altar. So 
he's not carrying it.
 
CYRUS'S CURRENT ATTUNEMENTS:
*	Pearl of Power (Uncommon, Attunement) - Recover one expended 
spell slot up to 3rd level, once per day
*	Amulet of the Depths (Rare, Attunement) - Water breathing, 60 ft 
swim speed, resistance to cold damage
*	Goggles of Night (Uncommon, Attunement) - Darkvision 60 ft
All 3 slots filled.
 
You turn to Cyrus. "Brother, you're maxed out on attunements. Any interest in 
swapping something for the Ring of Protection or Cloak of Displacement? The 
Ring would give you +1 AC and saves - might help against that Hellfire Orb. 
The Cloak would make you harder to hit."
Cyrus considers this carefully, looking at his current items.
His Analysis:
"The Pearl of Power is essential - getting back a 3rd-level spell slot means 
an extra Mass Healing Word, Spirit Guardians, or Dispel Magic. I can't give 
that up, especially going into undead territory.
The Amulet of the Depths - we're not expecting water work at Dargaard 
Keep, but the cold resistance might matter if we're dealing with undead or 
cursed environments. Still, it's situational.
The Goggles of Night - darkvision in a dark, abandoned keep? That's not 
situational, that's essential. I need to see to cast spells, to Turn Undead, to 
navigate."
He thinks for a moment longer. "The Ring of Protection would be valuable - 
better AC, better saves. But here's my thinking: if combat starts, I need 
to avoid being the target. My job is staying alive to heal, to turn undead, to 
provide radiant damage. The best defense is not drawing aggro in the first 
place."
His Decision:
"I'm keeping my current loadout. The Pearl gives me more spell resources, the 
Goggles let me function in darkness, and the Amulet... well, cold resistance 
might matter more than we think in a cursed fortress."
He looks at you seriously. "The Ring of Protection would be better on you, 
Johannes. You're going to be on the front line with your eldritch blasts. You'll 
be drawing attention. +1 AC and saves could be the difference between you 
staying conscious and going down."
His Recommendation:
"Johannes, you should take the Ring of Protection. You've currently got 
Ring of Mind Shielding, Amulet of Health, and Trident of Warning. All three 
are valuable, but... do you need the Trident in a landlocked fortress? Could you 
swap that out for the Ring of Protection?"
Cyrus makes a good point. Johannes's current attunements:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (Uncommon, Attunement) - Patron can't 
read thoughts, soul storage
*	Amulet of Health (Rare, Attunement) - Constitution becomes 19
*	Trident of Warning (Uncommon, Attunement) - Advantage on 
initiative, can't be surprised
Would Johannes want to:
1.	Keep current loadout (Ring, Amulet, Trident)
2.	Swap Trident for Ring of Protection (+1 AC, +1 saves)
3.	Different configuration?
The Trident's advantage on initiative and surprise immunity is very 
valuable, but the Ring of Protection's defensive boost is also strong. 
Your call.
I am good. Let's it the road.
Dec 10
DARGAARD VILLAGE - MID-MORNING, DAY 4
The party enters the village proper, and the atmosphere is unmistakably tense. 
The few villagers visible on the streets give you wary glances before hurrying 
about their business. The place has the feel of a community that's learned to 
keep its head down and avoid trouble.
The village layout is simple:
*	The Weary Traveler Inn (two-story building, looks like the social 
hub)
*	General Store (shuttered, but smoke from chimney suggests 
someone's inside)
*	Blacksmith's Forge (cold, no activity)
*	Shrine to Mishakal (small stone structure at village center, well-
maintained)
*	Various homes (scattered, modest, quiet)
And looming in the distance to the north, visible between 
buildings: Dargaard Keep, dark and brooding on its high promontory.
As you walk toward the inn, an elderly man sitting on a bench outside quickly 
stands and moves inside. A woman hanging laundry freezes, watches you pass, 
then continues her work with nervous energy.
The Weary Traveler Inn:
The door creaks as you enter. The common room is dim - only a few candles lit 
despite the daylight outside. There are perhaps six people inside: an innkeeper 
behind the bar (middle-aged woman, tired eyes), two farmers nursing ale in 
the corner, and an elderly couple eating a quiet breakfast.
All conversation stops when you enter. Eyes turn to you - not hostile, but 
deeply cautious.
The innkeeper wipes her hands on her apron and approaches, her voice low. 
"Travelers. We... we don't get many travelers here." She glances toward the 
northern window - toward the keep - then back to you. "Looking for rooms? 
Meals?"
Her tone suggests she's hoping you're just passing through.
How do you want to approach this? Johannes, do you:
1.	Take the lead in conversation
2.	Let Kessa handle it (she's good with people)
3.	Let Cyrus speak (cleric of Mishakal might put them at ease)
4.	All introduce yourselves together
And what's your initial approach - direct questions about the keep, 
or ease into it?

Dec 10
Cyrus Steps Forward
Brother Cyrus moves to the front, his manner calm and non-threatening. He's 
wearing his holy symbol of Mishakal openly, and his demeanor radiates the 
peaceful authority of a healer rather than a warrior.
"Peace be with you, goodwife," he says gently. "We're not here to cause 
trouble. My name is Brother Cyrus, a cleric of Mishakal. These are my 
companions, Kessa and Johannes."
The innkeeper's posture relaxes slightly when she sees the holy symbol. The 
elderly couple at the table exchanges a glance - recognition, perhaps relief.
"I'm Marda," the innkeeper says, her voice still cautious but less tense. "Marda 
Greystone. This is my inn." She gestures to the tables. "You're welcome here, 
of course. We... we serve Mishakal too." She nods toward the window. "The 
shrine outside - we maintain it. It's... it's important to have the Healing 
Goddess watching over us."
One of the farmers in the corner speaks up, an older man with weathered 
hands. "You're from Haven, aren't you? We heard about the resistance. About 
the Dragon Army being pushed back."
There's a mixture of hope and fear in his voice - hope that someone is fighting 
back, fear of what that might bring to their doorstep.
Cyrus nods. "We are. But we're not here to bring war to your village. We're 
here seeking information." He pauses, choosing his words carefully. "We've 
heard there was... activity. Dragon Army soldiers heading toward the keep. We 
need to know what happened."
The room goes very quiet. Marda's face pales slightly. The elderly man at the 
table makes the same warding gesture you saw earlier.
The farmer who spoke stands slowly. His name, you learn, is Torval. He's 
perhaps sixty, with the look of someone who's seen too much.
"You're asking about the keep," he says quietly. "About what happened to 
those soldiers." He looks at Marda, who gives a small nod. "Sit down. I'll tell 
you what we know. But first..." He looks at Cyrus specifically. "First, tell me 
true - are you here to fight whatever's up there? Or just to look?"
His tone suggests the answer matters greatly to him.
How does Cyrus respond?
We are not sure, to be honest. This keep only came to our attention based on 
the report of the Dragon Army visit. We are trying to see what they are 
looking for and how it might affect the resistance. As for fighting, it depends 
on what we find. If there is a threat, we will determine if we can do something 
or if the resistance needs to commit more resources. But if it is a threat to you, 
we will do what we can.
Dec 10
Cyrus delivers Johannes's words with his characteristic honesty and calm 
authority. "We're not sure, to be honest. This keep only came to our attention 
based on the report of the Dragon Army visit. We're trying to see what they're 
looking for and how it might affect the resistance."
He pauses, meeting Torval's eyes directly. "As for fighting - it depends on what 
we find. If there's a threat, we'll determine if we can handle it or if the 
resistance needs to commit more resources. But if it's a threat to you, to this 
village, we'll do what we can."
Torval studies Cyrus for a long moment, then nods slowly. "Honest answer. I 
appreciate that." He gestures to a table. "Sit. I'll tell you what happened."
 
TORVAL'S ACCOUNT:
Once you're seated and Marda has brought mugs of weak ale, Torval begins:
"About eight days ago - maybe nine - we saw them. Dragon Army patrol, 
maybe fifteen, twenty soldiers. They came through the village just after dawn, 
heading north toward the keep. Their officer - dragonborn, red scales - he 
stopped here, asked questions."
Marda interjects: "Wanted to know about the keep. Its history. Whether 
anyone had been inside recently. Whether we'd seen... him." She doesn't say 
the name, but everyone knows who she means.
Torval continues: "I told him the truth - no one goes near the keep. Not for 
generations. Not since..." He trails off, then pushes forward. "The officer 
seemed satisfied. Said they were conducting a 'historical survey' for the 
Dragon Army. Paid for supplies - food, rope, torches. Then they headed up the 
mountain road."
He takes a drink. "That was eight days ago. We haven't seen them since."
The elderly man at the other table speaks up, his voice thin: "But 
we've heard things. Three nights ago, there was... screaming. Carried on the 
wind from up there. And lights - not torches, but cold blue lights in the 
towers."
The elderly woman beside him adds quietly: "And the ravens. So many ravens, 
circling the keep. They don't usually do that."
Marda's addition: "Two days ago, my nephew Dren - he's twelve, foolish 
boy - he took his father's spyglass and climbed the ridge to the east where you 
can see the keep better. He came back white as a sheet, wouldn't talk for 
hours. Finally told us he saw... movement in the courtyard. Not the soldiers. 
Something else. Dark shapes, moving wrong."
Torval leans forward. "Here's what you need to understand about Dargaard 
Keep, and about Lord Soth. The stories aren't just stories. My grandfather's 
grandfather saw the keep on the night of the Cataclysm - saw it burning with 
cold fire, heard screaming that lasted until dawn. And since then, no one who's 
gone inside has come back out."
He counts on his fingers: "Twenty years ago, a group of treasure hunters - six 
of them, well-armed. Gone. Thirty-five years ago, a scholar from Palanthas 
with two guards. Gone. Fifty years ago, a young knight seeking to 'cleanse' the 
keep. Gone."
"The keep doesn't kill quickly. It keeps people. You hear them sometimes, on 
quiet nights. Voices on the wind."
The elderly woman speaks again: "Lord Soth was a good man once. My 
grandmother told stories her grandmother told her - how he protected the 
region, how he was noble and just. But something broke in him. Some terrible 
choice, some betrayal. And when the Cataclysm came, instead of dying clean, 
he was cursed. Bound to the keep, bound to his guilt, bound to relive his 
failure forever."
She looks at Cyrus directly. "You serve Mishakal. You know about curses, 
about how the gods punish betrayal. Lord Soth is still being punished. Three 
hundred years of torment. And whatever those Dragon Army soldiers wanted 
from him... it woke something up. The keep's been quiet for years. Now 
it's active again."
 
PRACTICAL INFORMATION:
Torval pulls out a rough map on a piece of cloth - clearly something the village 
has used before:
"The mountain road is about five miles. Takes two, maybe three hours on foot 
- it's steep and rocky. The keep sits on a promontory - sheer cliffs on three 
sides, only one approach from the south. There's a gatehouse, mostly intact, 
then the main courtyard. The great hall still stands, and three towers - 
northeast, northwest, and one over the main entrance."
He points to various spots on the map. "The east wall partially collapsed 
during the Cataclysm - there's rubble and a possible way in if the main gate is 
blocked or watched. The dungeons are beneath the main structure - flooded in 
places, we think."
Marda adds: "If you're going up there, go in daylight. Things are... worse at 
night. The screaming, the lights, the feeling of that place - it's all worse after 
dark."
 
Torval looks at the three of you seriously. "I'll be honest - I'm hoping you'll go 
up there, find those Dragon Army bastards dead, realize there's nothing to be 
gained, and report back to Haven that the keep should be left alone. Sealed. 
Forgotten."
"But if you do go inside..." He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a small 
carved wooden token - a symbol of Mishakal. "Take this. My wife carved it 
before she died. It won't protect you from steel or magic, but it might... remind 
whatever's up there that you serve the gods of light, not darkness."
He offers it to Cyrus.
Does Cyrus accept? And what other questions do you want to ask 
before potentially scouting the keep?
Torval needs that token more than we do. Not because it isn't important, but 
its power comes from Torval's personal connection with it. That's not 
something that can be shared. But we have our own tokens. And the thought 
is deeply appreciated. Since we won't leave until morning, we make 
arrangements to spend the night. If there is anyone who needs healing, we 
invite them to come to the inn so Cyrus can administer to them before we go 
to sleep.
Dec 10
Torval's Reaction:
The old farmer pauses, the token still in his outstretched hand, then slowly 
closes his fingers around it. His eyes glisten slightly.
"You understand," he says quietly. "Most wouldn't. Most would just take it and 
think themselves protected." He tucks the token back into his pocket, over his 
heart. "Thank you. And... may Mishakal watch over you. You'll need her more 
than we will."
 
LODGING ARRANGEMENTS:
Marda nods gratefully. "I have three rooms available. Two silver per room for 
the night, includes breakfast. It's simple fare, but it's honest."
She glances toward the window - the keep is visible in the distance, dark 
against the grey sky. "You're staying the night before going up there? That's... 
wise. The road is treacherous if you're not familiar with it, and you don't want 
to be caught up there after dark."
Cost: 6 silver total for three rooms
 
CYRUS'S HEALING OFFER:
When Cyrus announces that he'll provide healing to anyone in the village who 
needs it, there's a moment of stunned silence. Then Marda's expression shifts - 
something between hope and disbelief.
"You... you'd do that? For free?"
"We haven't had a healer visit in over a year," Torval says quietly. "The last 
cleric who came through charged two gold per casting. Most folks here can't 
afford that."
Marda quickly moves to the door and steps outside. Within minutes, word has 
spread through the village with remarkable speed.
 
THE HEALING LINE (Afternoon):
Over the next few hours, a steady stream of villagers comes to the inn. They're 
hesitant at first, but Cyrus's genuine warmth and professional manner puts 
them at ease.
Those who come:
1.	Old Gareth (elderly farmer, chronic back pain from decades of labor) -
 Lesser Restoration eases the persistent inflammation
2.	Young Willem (14 years old, broke his arm three weeks ago, set 
poorly) - Lesser Restoration corrects the improper healing
3.	Marda's sister, Elda (persistent cough, possibly consumption) -
 Lesser Restoration clears the infection
4.	A young mother, Sera (exhaustion, malnourishment from giving 
most of her food to her children) - Cure Wounds + advice on nutrition
5.	Old Thom (partial blindness from cataracts) - Cyrus can't fix this 
permanently without Greater Restoration, but explains honestly what 
would be needed
6.	A child, maybe 7 (infected cut on leg, beginning to fester) - Cure 
Wounds + proper bandaging
7.	Torval himself (arthritis in hands and knees) - Lesser 
Restoration provides significant relief
Between major healings, Cyrus provides basic medical care - cleaning wounds, 
advising on care, offering prayers and comfort.
 
THE VILLAGE'S RESPONSE:
By evening, the atmosphere in the village has shifted dramatically. People are 
smiling - genuinely smiling - for the first time since you arrived. Children are 
playing outside. There's life here again, however brief.
Marda refuses to take payment for the rooms. "After what Brother Cyrus has 
done? Your coin's no good here. The rooms are yours, and dinner too."
Torval approaches your table during the evening meal - simple stew, bread, 
and ale, but prepared with obvious care.
"You asked earlier what we knew about the keep, about Lord Soth. Let me tell 
you something else - something important." He sits down, his voice low 
enough that only your table can hear.
"The Dragon Army officer who came through - the dragonborn - he asked 
specifically about the Chapel. Wanted to know if it was still standing, if anyone 
had been inside, if we knew what was kept there."
He leans forward. "The Chapel of the Order was where Lord Soth kept his 
most sacred items - relics of Paladine, artifacts from his service as a knight. 
After the Cataclysm, after the curse... legend says those holy items 
became twisted. Corrupted. But still powerful."
"If the Dragon Army is looking for something specific, it's probably in that 
Chapel. And if Lord Soth is protecting anything, it'll be that."
He stands. "Thought you should know. Give you something specific to look 
for."
 
EVENING AT THE INN:
As darkness falls, the mood in the common room is surprisingly warm despite 
the ominous presence of the keep in the distance. Villagers who were healed 
earlier have brought small gifts - a loaf of fresh bread, a wheel of cheese, a 
bottle of decent wine.
Marda serves dinner and the common room gradually fills with locals - not 
celebrating exactly, but finding comfort in community after months of fear 
and isolation.
From the northern window, you can see Dargaard Keep silhouetted against the 
darkening sky. As full night falls, you notice what the villagers mentioned: 
faint blue-white lights appearing in the towers. Not torchlight. Something else. 
Something cold.
And if you listen carefully, carried on the wind, you might hear something that 
could be the wind through ruined stone... or could be distant voices, crying 
out.
 
NIGHT PREPARATIONS:
Before bed, the party has time to:
*	Discuss tomorrow's approach
*	Prepare spells (Cyrus can choose his prepared spell list)
*	Check equipment
*	Rest and recover
How do you want to approach tomorrow? And Cyrus, what spells 
are you preparing for an undead-infested cursed fortress?
That is up to you (Ai is playing Cyrus), but we get all the sleep we can, good 
food in the morning and then head out.
Dec 10
CYRUS'S SPELL PREPARATION:
That evening, Cyrus spends an hour in meditation and prayer, preparing his 
spells for what lies ahead. Given the likelihood of undead, curses, and the need 
for survival, he selects:
Cantrips: Sacred Flame, Spare the Dying, Guidance, Light, Thaumaturgy
1st Level (4 slots): Cure Wounds, Healing Word, Bless, Detect Evil and 
Good
2nd Level (3 slots): Lesser Restoration, Prayer of Healing, Spiritual 
Weapon
3rd Level (3 slots): Mass Healing Word, Dispel Magic, Spirit Guardians
4th Level (2 slots): Death Ward, Freedom of Movement
Prepared for: Undead encounters, curse removal, party survivability, 
radiant damage, and emergency healing.
 
NIGHT AT THE INN:
The party rests well - the beds are simple but clean, and the village's gratitude 
has created an atmosphere of genuine safety despite the ominous keep 
looming in the darkness.
During the night, around 2 AM, Johannes (with his Trident of Warning 
keeping him alert) hears the distant sound carried on the wind - that eerie 
wailing from the keep. It lasts perhaps ten minutes, then fades. Nothing 
approaches the village.
 
MORNING - DAY 5
Dawn breaks grey and cool. Marda serves a solid breakfast - porridge, fresh 
bread, eggs, bacon, and strong tea. The common room is quiet, with a few 
early-rising villagers watching you prepare with somber expressions.
Torval approaches as you're finishing. "The morning's clear. Good visibility for 
the road. You'll reach the keep by mid-morning if you keep a steady pace." He 
pauses. "I'll be honest - I hope you come back before nightfall. We all do."
Several villagers have gathered outside - not to see you off exactly, but to 
witness. There's a sense that something significant is happening, that the 
keep's long silence is ending one way or another.
An elderly woman presses a small loaf of bread wrapped in cloth into Kessa's 
hands. "For the road. And... thank you. For what your cleric did yesterday."
 
THE MOUNTAIN ROAD - MID-MORNING
The path to Dargaard Keep is exactly as described - steep, rocky, winding up 
through increasingly barren terrain. The forest gives way to scrub, then to bare 
rock. The temperature drops as you climb.
After about two and a half hours of steady climbing, you round a bend and 
there it is:
DARGAARD KEEP - EXTERIOR VIEW
The fortress sits on a high promontory, commanding views of the surrounding 
valleys. It's massive - easily 200 feet on each side, with three towers rising 60-
80 feet into the air. The architecture is classic Solamnic - strong, elegant, built 
to last centuries.
But the Cataclysm left its mark. The eastern wall has partially collapsed, 
leaving a tumbled slope of massive stone blocks. Scorch marks blacken the 
stone in places - not from normal fire, but something else. Something that 
burned with unnatural heat. Windows are dark, empty eye sockets. The main 
gate hangs partially open, one massive door twisted off its hinges.
And there's an atmosphere to the place. The air feels heavier here, colder 
despite the morning sun. Birds don't fly near it. No vegetation grows within 
fifty feet of the walls.
You're currently about 400 feet from the main gate, on the southern approach 
- the only accessible path. The gatehouse is partially intact, with murder holes 
and arrow slits visible above. The courtyard beyond is visible through the 
damaged gate - overgrown with dead vegetation, littered with rubble.
WHAT YOU CAN SEE FROM HERE:
*	Main gate (damaged, partially open)
*	Gatehouse (intact but dark)
*	Eastern wall breach (possible alternate entry, 150 feet right of main 
gate)
*	Three towers: Northeast, Northwest, and Central (over main entrance)
*	Faint blue-white glow visible in upper windows of Northeast tower
*	No visible movement
*	No signs of the Dragon Army patrol (no bodies, no equipment, no 
campfires)
Kessa murmurs: "Place feels wrong. Like it's watching us."
Cyrus: "I can feel it too. Mishakal's presence is... distant here. Muted. 
Whatever curse binds this place, it's powerful."
How do you want to approach? Johannes, what's the plan?
I never like going through the front door. If the eastern wall is accessible and 
safe, let's go in that way.
Dec 10
APPROACH TO EASTERN WALL BREACH
"Agreed," Kessa says quietly. "Front gates are where defenders expect you. 
And where they set traps."
The party circles wide, keeping distance from the keep while moving toward 
the collapsed eastern section. The terrain is rough - loose scree and broken 
stone - requiring careful footing.
As you get closer, the scale of the destruction becomes apparent. The eastern 
wall didn't just collapse - it exploded outward. Massive stone blocks, each 
weighing tons, are scattered across the slope like a giant's discarded toys. The 
scorch marks here are more intense, with strange patterns that suggest the 
stone melted and re-solidified in the instant of destruction.
BREACH ASSESSMENT (100 feet out):
The collapsed section creates a rough ramp of rubble leading up and into what 
appears to be the keep's interior. The breach is about 40 feet wide. You can see 
into a large chamber beyond - partially exposed to the sky where the roof 
collapsed.
Kessa scouts ahead (Stealth check with expertise): She moves forward 
carefully, using the rubble for cover, watching for trip wires, pressure plates, 
or signs of recent passage.
After five minutes, she returns. "Good news and bad news. Good news - no 
traps that I can see, and there are recent boot prints in the dust inside. Dragon 
Army was definitely here, and they used this entrance."
"Bad news - the prints go in, but I didn't see any coming back out. And there's 
something else..." She pauses. "The air coming from inside is cold. Not natural 
cold. Wrong cold."
Cyrus casts Detect Evil and Good (10-minute duration, 30-foot radius):
He closes his eyes, focusing. After a moment, his expression tightens. 
"There's... something. Undead presence, multiple sources. Not close - maybe 
100, 150 feet beyond the breach, deeper in the structure. And something else... 
aberrant. Unnatural. The whole place radiates wrongness."
He opens his eyes. "Whatever's in there, it knows we're here. Or will know the 
moment we enter. Places like this are aware."
FINAL APPROACH DECISION:
You're 100 feet from the breach. The interior chamber beyond is partially lit by 
dim grey daylight filtering through the collapsed roof. You can see:
*	Rubble-strewn floor
*	Partial walls creating shadowed alcoves
*	Doorways leading deeper into the keep (north and west)
*	Boot prints in the dust heading northwest
*	No immediate movement or threats
Before entering, do you want to:
1.	Buff before entry? (Bless, Guidance, etc.)
2.	Light sources? (Cyrus has Goggles of Night, but Johannes and Kessa 
will need light unless you use Kessa's darkvision and have Johannes use 
eldritch sight)
3.	Marching order? (Who goes first, second, third?)
4.	Any specific precautions or preparations?
This is your last moment of relative safety before entering 
Dargaard Keep. What's your final loadout and approach?
Buff as possible for all. Kessa goes first, followed by Johannes and Cyrus side 
by side, where they can cover Kessa's progress. No light; darkvision, googles, 
and Devil's Sight going forward.
Dec 10
FINAL PREPARATIONS BEFORE ENTRY
The party takes a few minutes to prepare, huddled behind a large piece of 
rubble about 80 feet from the breach.
BUFFS APPLIED:
Cyrus casts Bless (Concentration, 1 minute duration):
*	Johannes, Kessa, and Cyrus each gain +1d4 to attack rolls and saving 
throws
*	Cyrus will maintain concentration as long as possible
Cyrus uses Guidance (as needed):
*	Can provide +1d4 to ability checks for anyone about to make a critical 
roll
EQUIPMENT CHECK:
*	Kessa: Hand crossbow loaded, daggers ready, Ring of Feather Falling 
attuned, darkvision (60 ft)
*	Johannes: Eldritch blast ready, Devil's Sight (120 ft magical darkness 
vision), all attunements active
*	Cyrus: Holy symbol visible, Goggles of Night providing darkvision (60 
ft), shield and mace ready
MARCHING ORDER: Kessa (point, stealth) ? 15 feet ? Johannes & Cyrus 
(side by side, covering)
NO LIGHT SOURCES - Full dark operations using:
*	Kessa's natural darkvision (60 ft)
*	Johannes's Devil's Sight (120 ft, sees through magical darkness)
*	Cyrus's Goggles of Night (60 ft darkvision)
The party can operate in complete darkness, invisible to anyone watching 
from deeper in the keep who might be relying on torchlight or normal vision.
 
BREACH ENTRY
Kessa moves first, low and quiet (Stealth: 24), using the rubble for cover. She 
pauses at the lip of the breach, scanning the interior with her darkvision, then 
signals back: Clear, come forward.
Johannes and Cyrus advance together, weapons ready but not drawn 
aggressively. The three of you slip through the breach and into Dargaard 
Keep.
 
INTERIOR - EASTERN CHAMBER
You're standing in what was once a large barracks or common hall - roughly 
60 feet by 40 feet. The Cataclysm's destruction is evident:
What you see:
*	Partially collapsed roof allowing grey daylight through gaps
*	Rubble-covered floor with clear paths between debris
*	Three doorways: one northwest (boot prints lead here), one north, one 
west
*	Remnants of bunks and furniture, rotted to skeletal frames
*	Scorch marks on walls showing the same unnatural burning pattern
*	Boot prints clearly visible - multiple sets, recent (within the last 
week), all heading northwest
*	The air is unnaturally cold and still
*	Dust hangs in the air, undisturbed except where the patrol walked
Cyrus's Detect Evil and Good (still active): He points northwest. "The 
undead presence is that direction. Multiple entities, moving slowly. Maybe 120 
feet distant, through walls."
Kessa examines the boot prints (Investigation: 19): "Fifteen to twenty 
individuals, just like the report. They moved cautiously but not stealthily - 
they weren't expecting trouble. Prints are consistent with Dragon Army 
regulation boots. All going northwest, none coming back. No signs of combat 
here - no scuff marks, no blood, no dropped equipment."
She looks up at you. "They went in confident. Question is, did they find what 
they were looking for, or did it find them?"
The three doorways:
1.	Northwest doorway (where boot prints lead): Leads into darkness, 
seems to open into a larger space. The cold air is strongest from this 
direction.
2.	North doorway: Smaller, leads to what might be a corridor. No boot 
prints.
3.	West doorway: Partially blocked by rubble. Looks like it leads toward 
the keep's exterior walls.
Johannes, what's your call? Follow the patrol's trail northwest, or 
investigate one of the other routes first?
west. I want to make sure there is nothing behind us before we move too far 
into the Keep
Dec 10
TACTICAL DECISION - SECURE THE FLANKS
"Smart," Kessa murmurs. "Clear our six before we go deep. Last thing we need 
is something coming up behind us."
Cyrus nods agreement, adjusting his grip on his mace. "The undead aren't 
moving toward us yet. We have time to be thorough."
 
WESTERN DOORWAY INVESTIGATION
Kessa approaches the west doorway carefully. It's partially blocked by rubble - 
a section of the upper wall has collapsed inward, creating a pile of stone blocks 
about 4 feet high that partially obstructs the passage.
Kessa examines the rubble (Investigation: 16): "Stable. Old collapse, not 
recent. No sign the Dragon Army tried to move through here - dust is 
undisturbed." She peers over the rubble pile into the darkness beyond. 
"Passage continues about 15 feet, then opens into another chamber. I can see... 
looks like exterior wall with arrow slits. Might be a guard room or defensive 
position."
Cyrus checks with Detect Evil and Good: "No undead presence in that 
direction. Whatever's active in the keep, it's not behind us."
Kessa climbs over the rubble (Athletics: 14, successful): She moves 
quietly through the narrow passage and into the chamber beyond, 
disappearing from view for about thirty seconds. Then she returns, climbing 
back over.
"Guard room, like I thought. Twenty by twenty feet, arrow slits overlooking 
the southern approach - would have given defenders a clear view of anyone 
coming up the road. Three skeletons in armor slumped against the walls - 
looks like they died during the Cataclysm and stayed dead. No movement, no 
magic, just bones."
She brushes dust off her hands. "Room's a dead end - literally. No other exits 
except back this way. Nothing threatening, nothing valuable that I could see in 
a quick scan."
CLEAR - Western route secured, no threats.
 
NORTHERN DOORWAY INVESTIGATION
"North next?" Kessa asks, already moving toward the smaller doorway.
This passage is clearer - no rubble blocking it. It's a standard corridor, about 5 
feet wide, leading north into darkness. The walls here show less fire damage, 
suggesting this section was more protected during the Cataclysm.
Kessa scouts forward (Stealth: 26): She advances about 30 feet down the 
corridor, checking for traps, pressure plates, or signs of recent passage. The 
corridor turns west after 30 feet, and she pauses at the corner, listening.
She returns silently. "Corridor runs north thirty feet, then turns west. From 
the corner, I could see it opens into a larger space - maybe another hall or 
room. No boot prints, no recent traffic. But..." She frowns. "I heard something. 
Faint. Could be wind through broken stone, could be something else. Distant, 
rhythmic. Like... breathing, but slow. Very slow."
Cyrus checks Detect Evil and Good: "There's an undead presence in that 
direction, but distant. Maybe 80-100 feet through walls. It's not moving. 
Just... existing."
Johannes, you have options:
1.	Investigate north corridor fully - clear the entire route, see what's 
in that larger chamber
2.	Mark north as 'investigated but not cleared' - you know what's 
there generally, move on
3.	Follow the Dragon Army trail northwest - you've secured 
immediate flanks, time to track the patrol
What's your call?
Investigate north thoroughly.
Dec 10
NORTHERN CORRIDOR - FULL INVESTIGATION
"Let's clear it completely," Johannes decides. "I want to know what we're 
dealing with before we commit to the main trail."
Kessa nods and moves forward again, the party following in formation - Kessa 
leading by 15 feet, Johannes and Cyrus side by side behind her.
 
THE CORRIDOR (30 feet north, then turns west)
The passage is relatively intact - stone walls show minimal damage, though the 
air grows progressively colder as you advance. Your breath mists in the 
darkness.
At the corner, Kessa signals a halt and peers around carefully.
What Kessa sees (Perception: 21):
The corridor opens into a chapel - roughly 40 feet by 30 feet. Even in the 
darkness visible through darkvision, the room's purpose is clear:
*	Stone altar at the far end (north wall), cracked but intact
*	Pews overturned and scattered
*	Shattered stained glass windows on the east and west walls
*	Religious iconography - symbols of Paladine - defaced and broken
*	A figure kneeling before the altar - humanoid, motionless, facing 
away from you
The rhythmic sound Kessa heard is clearer now - it's coming from the figure. A 
slow, rasping breath. In... out... in... out... like someone in deep meditation or 
prayer.
Cyrus's Detect Evil and Good: "Undead. Definitely undead. That figure at 
the altar." His voice is barely a whisper. "Single entity, not moving. But the 
presence is... strong. This isn't a mindless zombie."
Kessa reports back (whispering): "One undead, kneeling at the altar. 
Hasn't reacted to us yet - either doesn't know we're here or doesn't care. No 
sign of the Dragon Army patrol. No other exits visible from this angle, but the 
room's not fully clear - could be doorways on the sides I can't see from here."
The figure continues its slow breathing, unchanged.
Johannes, you have several options:
1.	Observe longer - try to identify what type of undead this is before 
engaging
2.	Attempt to bypass - back out quietly, leave it undisturbed
3.	Engage from range - Johannes and Cyrus prepare attacks, Kessa 
provides flanking
4.	Cyrus attempts Turn Undead - might cause it to flee or might 
trigger combat
5.	Try communication - some intelligent undead can be reasoned with
What's your approach?
Do we think this is the Chapel that Torval mentioned?
Dec 10
STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
Johannes freezes, processing what he's seeing. He whispers back to the others: 
"Wait. Torval mentioned the Chapel of the Order - where Lord Soth kept 
sacred relics and artifacts. Said the Dragon Army officer specifically asked 
about it. Is this that chapel?"
Kessa frowns, studying the room more carefully. "It's a chapel, but... this feels 
small for what Torval described. This is maybe a private prayer room or guard 
chapel. Twenty soldiers stationed here would need something bigger for 
formal services."
Cyrus, still sensing the undead presence, whispers: "The Chapel of the Order 
would be in the keep proper - likely off the great hall or near the lord's 
quarters. This is eastern barracks territory. This would be for common 
soldiers, daily prayers, small ceremonies."
He pauses, thinking. "But that doesn't mean it's not important. If this undead 
is praying or maintaining vigil, it might be bound here for a reason. Could be 
a fallen knight, a priest, someone cursed to eternal penance."
Kessa adds: "The Dragon Army patrol didn't come through here - no boot 
prints in the corridor. Which means either they knew this wasn't the main 
chapel, or they had intelligence pointing them elsewhere. They went northwest 
from the entry chamber, remember?"
Johannes's tactical assessment:
This IS a chapel, but probably NOT the Chapel of the Order that the Dragon 
Army was seeking. That would be deeper in the keep, likely more central and 
grander. However, this undead figure could still be:
1.	A guardian - protecting this section of the keep
2.	A bound spirit - cursed to pray eternally for its sins
3.	A potential source of information - if intelligent and 
communicative
4.	A distraction - something to avoid while pursuing the main objective
The question is: Do you want to engage with this undead now, or 
bypass it and follow the Dragon Army trail to what's likely the 
MAIN chapel?
What's your decision?
We need to get a sense of how the denizens of the Keep are going to interact 
with us. Rather than assuming immediate hostility, let's announce our 
presence, and our intent, which is not to loot, steal, or desecrate, not even to 
study, but to determine if this place poses a threat to our interests, and to 
determine if the occupants would be interested in assistance (religious, 
magical, etc.) in their circumstances or just to be left alone.
Dec 10
A BOLD APPROACH
Kessa's eyes widen slightly. "You want to talk to it?" Her tone isn't dismissive - 
more impressed and cautious.
Cyrus considers this, then nods slowly. "It's... not a terrible idea. If Lord Soth 
and his knights are truly cursed rather than simply evil, they might respond to 
respect and honesty. And if they attack, we're prepared."
Johannes steps forward carefully, moving past Kessa to the corner where he 
can see into the chapel. He takes a breath, then speaks clearly but respectfully 
into the darkness - his voice carrying but not aggressive:
"We seek no treasure, no relics, and intend no desecration. We are Johannes 
Constantinius, Kessa Darrow, and Brother Cyrus of Mishakal. We've come to 
determine whether this place poses a threat to the living, and whether those 
who dwell here require aid - be it spiritual, magical, or simply to be left in 
peace."
 
THE FIGURE'S RESPONSE
For a long moment, nothing changes. The slow, rasping breathing continues. 
Then, gradually, it stops.
The silence is profound.
The figure at the altar moves - slowly, deliberately. It rises from its kneeling 
position with the careful movements of someone who has been still for a very, 
very long time. As it stands and turns to face you, you can see it clearly:
A knight in full plate armor, tarnished and ancient but still intact. The armor 
bears the symbols of the Knights of Solamnia - the kingfisher and rose. The 
helmet's visor is closed, but through the eye slits, you can see a faint blue-
white glow.
No flesh. No life. Just animated armor and the cold light of undeath.
When it speaks, the voice is hollow, echoing as if from a great distance. Not 
hostile, but profoundly weary:
"Three hundred years."
A pause.
"Three hundred years I have knelt here. Praying. Waiting. Hoping 
that Paladine would hear. That Mishakal would answer. That the 
gods would show mercy."
The knight takes one step forward, then stops, as if respecting the distance 
between you.
"But the gods do not answer. They turned away on the night of fire. 
When the world broke. When we broke."
The blue glow in the eye slits focuses on Cyrus specifically.
"You wear the symbol of the Healing Goddess. She who tends the 
wounded. Eases suffering." The voice cracks slightly, an emotion breaking 
through centuries of numbness. "Can she ease our suffering? Can she 
heal what was broken that night? Or are we beyond her grace?"
The knight's gauntleted hand moves to its chest, over the heart.
"I am - was - Sir Caradoc. Knight of the Crown. I served Lord Soth. 
I followed him. I stood by him when I should have stopped him. 
And when the curse fell... I could not die clean. None of us could."
"You ask if we pose a threat. We pose no threat to the innocent. We 
cannot leave. We are bound here. Bound to this place, to our 
failure, to our lord's damnation."
"You ask if we require aid." A bitter, hollow laugh. "Yes. We require 
the mercy of oblivion. But that mercy is denied us. We are cursed to 
remember. To witness. To endure."
Sir Caradoc looks past you, toward where you entered.
"But you spoke of others. Others came. Eight days past. Dragon 
Army soldiers. They did not announce themselves with honor. They 
came seeking power. Seeking our lord. Seeking to bargain with the 
damned."
The knight's tone darkens.
"They found him. In the Great Hall. And he... listened to them."
 
Cyrus steps forward carefully, his holy symbol visible:
"Sir Caradoc, I am Brother Cyrus, servant of Mishakal. Your suffering is heard, 
even if you believe the gods do not answer. Tell us - what did the Dragon Army 
want? What bargain did they offer Lord Soth?"
What does Johannes want to ask or say to Sir Caradoc?
The Disks have returned to the face of Krynn. The gods are ready to interact 
with mankind again, suggesting that whatever time or trial they have been 
called to endure can be at an end. We do not have the Disks with us, but they 
are available, if needed. But what happened to Soth after he met with the 
soldiers. Did he agree to anything? We do not seek to ask you to counter your 
lord's wishes; you have been faithful to your loyalty, despite its cost to you. We 
would not counter or risk that, but if there is aught we can do to help, help us 
understand what that is.
Dec 10
SIR CARADOC'S REACTION
The knight goes utterly still at Johannes's words. The blue glow in his eye slits 
flickers, intensifies.
"The Disks... returned?"
His voice is barely a whisper, as if speaking the words too loudly might shatter 
the hope behind them. The gauntleted hand at his chest trembles slightly.
"Three hundred years we have prayed. Three hundred years of 
silence. And now... now you say the gods have returned their grace 
to the world?"
Sir Caradoc takes a shuddering breath - unnecessary for an undead, but the 
memory of breathing, the habit of emotion expressed through mortal gesture.
"If this is true... if the gods truly hear again... then perhaps..." He 
stops, as if afraid to complete the thought. Then, more firmly: "You honor 
us with your offer. And you honor us more by not asking us to 
betray our oaths."
He straightens, and for a moment, you can see the knight he once was - proud, 
honorable, unbowed.
"I will tell you what I know. Not because I betray Lord Soth, but 
because if the gods have returned, then perhaps there is still 
purpose to our suffering. Perhaps witness can still matter."
 
SIR CARADOC'S ACCOUNT:
"Eight days ago, the Dragon Army came. Fifteen soldiers, led by a 
dragonborn officer named Vraxxis. They entered through the 
eastern breach, as you did. But they came with knowledge - they 
knew where to go, knew what to seek. Someone had given them 
intelligence about this place."
"They went directly to the Great Hall. To where Lord Soth... waits. 
Always waits. Reliving his failure, his damnation, over and over in 
an endless cycle."
"I could not follow - I am bound to this chapel, to my penance. But 
the others... the skeletal warriors who patrol the keep, the spirits 
bound to their posts... they reported what they witnessed."
"The dragonborn spoke to Lord Soth. Offered him a bargain."
Sir Caradoc's voice becomes strained, as if the words pain him to speak:
"They offered him purpose. Release from his endless cycle of 
torment. They said the Dragon Army seeks to reshape Krynn, to 
bring order through strength. They need commanders who 
understand true power, true sacrifice. They offered Lord Soth 
command of an undead legion - to fight, to serve, to have meaning 
again rather than eternal stagnation."
"And they offered him something else. Something from the Chapel 
of the Order. A relic he kept there before the Cataclysm. They 
claimed they could restore it, purify it, give him back a piece of 
what he lost."
The knight's voice drops to barely audible:
"The Starjewel. A holy relic of Paladine, given to Lord Soth when he 
achieved the rank of Knight of the Rose. It was his most treasured 
possession. When the curse fell, it became... corrupted. Tainted. A 
reminder of his fall rather than his glory."
"The Dragon Army claimed they had a cleric of Takhisis powerful 
enough to cleanse and re-sanctify it. To give Lord Soth back his 
honor, symbolically if not in truth."
 
THE BARGAIN:
"Lord Soth... listened. For the first time in three hundred years, 
he listened to someone. The Dragon Army offered him what we all 
crave - release from meaningless suffering. Purpose instead of 
punishment."
"But he did not agree immediately. Lord Soth is proud, even in 
damnation. He gave them a test."
"He sent them to the Chapel of the Order to retrieve the Starjewel 
themselves. If they could navigate the keep, survive its guardians, 
and bring the relic back to him, he would consider their offer. If 
they failed... well, their bones would join the others who have tried 
to plunder this place."
Sir Caradoc gestures northwest, in the direction the boot prints led.
"They went. Seven days ago. The Chapel lies in the keep's north 
wing, past the Great Hall, through the Gallery of Ancestors. It is... 
well-defended. The most sacred space in the keep, where the curse 
is strongest."
"I do not know if they succeeded. I have not seen them return. I 
have not heard Lord Soth's summons to the Great Hall. The keep 
has been... waiting."
 
SIR CARADOC'S PLEA:
The knight looks directly at Cyrus, then at Johannes.
"If the gods have truly returned, if Mishakal can hear prayers 
again, then perhaps there is hope for us. Not salvation - we are too 
far gone for that. But perhaps... purpose. Perhaps our suffering can 
mean something."
"If Lord Soth joins the Dragon Army, if he leads an undead legion, 
he will bring death and horror to thousands. He is a tactical genius, 
a warrior without peer, and completely without mercy. The Dragon 
Army would gain a weapon of terrible power."
"But if you could offer him something else... if you could bring 
proof that the gods have returned, that there is another path 
besides endless torment or service to Takhisis..."
He trails off, then adds more quietly:
"Or if you could stop him. Destroy the Starjewel before the Dragon 
Army can use it as leverage. Deny them their weapon. Even if it 
means we remain cursed forever."
"I have been loyal to Lord Soth for three hundred years. But I was 
loyal to the knight he was, not the death knight he became. If you 
can prevent him from spreading more suffering, more death... that 
would honor the man he once was."
 
PRACTICAL INFORMATION:
"The Dragon Army patrol went northwest from the entry chamber, 
into the Servants' Hall, then through to the Great Hall. From there, 
north through the Gallery of Ancestors to the Chapel of the Order. 
That is the route. You will face skeletal warriors - mindless, but 
deadly. You will face the spirits of those who died here - they are... 
less predictable. And if you reach the Chapel..."
He hesitates.
"Lady Korinthe guards it. Lord Soth's first wife. She died in the 
Cataclysm, in the fire, and she blames him for her death. She has 
become... something terrible. A banshee, filled with rage and grief. 
She cannot leave the Chapel, but within it, she is nearly 
unstoppable."
"If the Dragon Army soldiers are still alive, they are likely trapped 
there, unable to retrieve the Starjewel, unable to retreat."
 
Sir Caradoc waits for your response, the blue glow in his eye slits steady now. 
He has unburdened himself of information he's carried for days, and there's a 
sense of relief in his posture despite the weight of his words.
Johannes, how do you respond? And what is your plan?
I thank you for your honesty, Ser. We will also visit your Lord, and receive his 
permission to investigate the Chapel and what it holds. As we have said, we 
are not here for sordid mortal needs, but we seek to do what is right as it is 
given for us to know. If we are successful, we will do what we can to allow you 
the rest so long denied you. And we will leave word with the Clerics in Haven, 
that even should we fall, the Disks can be brought here, if needed, to end your 
vigil once and for all.
Dec 10
SIR CARADOC'S FAREWELL
The knight is silent for a long moment. Then, slowly, he places his right fist 
over his heart - the formal salute of the Knights of Solamnia. The gesture is 
precise, practiced, unchanged by three centuries of undeath.
"You have given me something I had not felt in three hundred 
years, Johannes Constantinius. Hope."
His voice is steadier now, stronger.
"You speak with honor. You approach our lord with respect rather 
than greed or fear. This... this is how knights once conducted 
themselves. How we once conducted ourselves, before the fall."
He lowers his hand.
"Go to the Great Hall. Announce yourself as you announced 
yourself to me - with honesty and respect. Lord Soth is... proud. 
Bitter. Consumed by his guilt and rage. But he was once the finest 
knight of his generation. That man still exists, buried beneath the 
curse. If anyone can reach him, it might be those who approach 
without deception."
"And if you succeed in bringing the Disks here, if the gods can 
finally grant us release..." His voice cracks slightly. "Then we will have 
endured for purpose. Our three hundred years of suffering will 
have meant something. We will have borne witness to darkness, 
and at the end, we will have been seen by the light."
He steps back toward the altar, then pauses.
"One more thing. When you face Lady Korinthe in the Chapel... do 
not fight her with steel or spell alone. She is grief and rage made 
manifest. If you must confront her, remember she was once a 
woman who loved deeply, who was betrayed, who died in terror 
and pain. She is as much a victim of the curse as any of us."
"Perhaps words of truth and compassion will reach her where 
violence cannot. Perhaps a servant of Mishakal can do what three 
hundred years of isolation could not."
He kneels once more before the altar, resuming his vigil position.
"May the gods you serve watch over you. And may you survive to 
bring their mercy to those of us who thought mercy lost forever."
The blue glow in his eye slits dims as he returns to his meditation, the slow 
rasping breath beginning again.
 
CYRUS'S REACTION:
As you leave the chapel and return to the corridor, Cyrus is visibly moved. He 
wipes his eyes.
"Three hundred years. Three hundred years of prayer with no answer. And he 
still hopes. Still believes." He grips his holy symbol. "Johannes, if we survive 
this, if we can help them... bringing the Disks here might be the most 
important thing we ever do."
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT:
"So we're going to walk up to a death knight and ask permission to investigate 
his cursed chapel? That's..." She pauses, then smiles slightly. "Actually 
brilliant. Respectful, unexpected, and if he says no, we've learned something. 
If he says yes, we have safe passage."
She checks her weapons. "Though I'm betting the Dragon Army didn't ask 
permission, which is why they might be trapped or dead in that Chapel."
 
ROUTE TO GREAT HALL:
You return to the eastern entry chamber. The boot prints still lead northwest 
through the doorway you haven't yet investigated.
The party prepares to follow the Dragon Army's trail to confront 
Lord Soth himself.
Marching order remains the same? Kessa forward, Johannes and 
Cyrus behind? And you're maintaining Bless and full dark 
operations?
Ready to proceed to the Great Hall?
Cyrus should go first, his mantle and tokens of office on full display. We follow 
a few steps behind. I encourage Cyrus to repeat the gist of what was shared 
with Caradoc, and in the same manner, when we reach Soth.
Dec 10
REVISED FORMATION - HERALD APPROACH
"Johannes is right," Cyrus says, his voice steady despite the gravity of what 
they're about to do. "If we're approaching as emissaries rather than intruders, 
I should lead. This is a matter of faith, honor, and divine authority. That's my 
domain."
He adjusts his holy symbol of Mishakal so it catches what little light there is, 
prominently displayed on his chest. He straightens his posture - no longer the 
cautious adventurer, but a cleric on holy business.
Kessa nods. "I'll stay close behind you two. If things go wrong, I can provide 
cover. But let Cyrus do the talking."
NEW MARCHING ORDER: Cyrus (leading, visible holy authority) 
? 5 feet ? Johannes & Kessa (flanking support)
Bless still active (6 more rounds/~36 seconds remaining)
 
NORTHWEST PASSAGE - FOLLOWING THE DRAGON ARMY 
TRAIL
Cyrus leads through the northwest doorway, following the clear boot prints in 
the dust. The passage is a wide corridor - 10 feet across - with vaulted ceilings 
that speak to the keep's former grandeur. Scorch marks mar the walls, and the 
air grows progressively colder.
After 30 feet, the corridor opens into a larger chamber.
SERVANTS' HALL (40 ft x 50 ft)
Once a bustling area where the keep's staff worked and lived. Now:
*	Long tables overturned and rotted
*	Scattered bones (non-animated) wearing the remains of servant clothing
*	Boot prints continue straight through, heading north toward a large 
archway
*	Two skeletal warriors standing motionless on either side of the north 
archway, wearing tattered Solamnic tabards, rusty swords in hand
The skeletons don't move or react as you enter. They simply stand at 
attention, like guards at their eternal post.
Cyrus pauses, then speaks clearly: "We come in peace, seeking audience with 
Lord Soth. We mean no desecration or theft."
The skeletons' empty eye sockets track his movement, but they make no 
hostile action. After a moment, one raises its sword in a vertical salute - the 
formal acknowledgment of one knight to another passing through their post.
Then both resume their motionless guard positions.
"They're... letting us pass," Kessa whispers, clearly impressed and unnerved.
 
THROUGH THE ARCHWAY - APPROACH TO GREAT HALL
Beyond the archway is a grand corridor - 15 feet wide, 20 feet high, with 
remnants of tapestries hanging in tatters. The boot prints continue forward.
At the end of this 40-foot corridor, you can see massive double doors, partially 
open. Cold blue light spills through the gap, and you can hear something:
A woman's voice, singing.
Not live singing - this is ethereal, distant, like a memory of music. The song is 
in a language you don't understand, but the emotion is unmistakable: grief, 
loss, accusation. The melody is beautiful and heartbreaking.
Cyrus recognizes it (Religion check: 18): "That's The Lament of Isolation - 
an old Solamnic funeral dirge. It's sung for those who die without honor, 
without redemption. It's... it's what Lady Korinthe would have sung for Lord 
Soth, if he had died clean."
The singing continues, echoing through the stone halls.
As you approach the doors, you can see into the Great Hall beyond:
*	Massive chamber, 80 feet long and 60 feet wide
*	High vaulted ceiling with collapsed sections letting in grey light
*	A throne at the far end, facing the entrance
*	Skeletal warriors (12-15) standing along the walls like statues
*	Ghostly figures (5-6) floating near the ceiling, translucent and ethereal
*	And on the throne, unmoving:
LORD SOTH
Even from 60 feet away, his presence is overwhelming. Full blackened plate 
armor wreathed in cold flames that don't consume. A greatsword laid across 
his lap. The helmet's visor open, revealing a skull with points of burning blue-
white light in the eye sockets.
He is perfectly still, staring forward at nothing, as the lament continues to sing 
around him.
The Dragon Army soldiers are visible too - their corpses, scattered around 
the hall. Fifteen bodies in Dragon Army uniforms, some skeletal, some 
partially preserved by the unnatural cold. They died violently - crushed armor, 
broken bones, evidence of massive trauma.
They never made it past the Great Hall.
 
Cyrus stops at the threshold, standing in the doorway where the light from 
outside meets the cold blue glow from within. He takes a breath, then speaks - 
his voice clear, respectful, carrying the authority of his office:
"Lord Soth, Knight of the Rose, Master of Dargaard Keep. I am 
Brother Cyrus, servant of Mishakal, the Healing Goddess. With me 
are Johannes Constantinius and Kessa Darrow. We come not as 
thieves or desecrators, but as seekers of truth and understanding."
The singing stops.
The silence is absolute.
Lord Soth's head turns - slowly, deliberately - to look at the doorway. At Cyrus. 
At the holy symbol of Mishakal gleaming on his chest.
When he speaks, his voice is like stones grinding together, ancient and heavy 
with centuries of pain:
"A cleric of Mishakal. In MY hall. Speaking of HEALING."
The cold flames around his armor flare brighter.
"What healing can you offer the damned, priest? What 
understanding exists for those who have already lost everything?"
Cyrus, the floor is yours. How do you present your case to Lord 
Soth?
A response based on the introduction we gave to Caradoc, including the 
information about the reemergence of the Disks.
Dec 10
CYRUS'S ADDRESS TO LORD SOTH
Brother Cyrus stands firm in the doorway, his voice steady and respectful, 
showing no fear despite the overwhelming presence before him:
"My lord, we seek no treasure, no relics, and intend no desecration. 
We come to determine whether this place poses a threat to the 
living, and whether those who dwell here require aid - be it 
spiritual, magical, or simply to be left in peace."
He pauses, then delivers the most important news:
"The Disks of Mishakal have returned to Krynn. After three 
hundred years of silence, the gods are ready to interact with 
mankind again. Whatever time or trial you and your knights have 
been called to endure may be at an end."
The cold flames around Lord Soth's armor flicker, dimming slightly. The death 
knight remains motionless, but there's a quality to his stillness now - not the 
frozen stasis of before, but the acute attention of someone hearing something 
they thought impossible.
Cyrus continues, his voice gaining strength:
"We do not have the Disks with us, but they exist. They have been 
found. The gods hear prayers again. Your suffering has been 
witnessed, my lord. Three hundred years of torment, three 
hundred years of isolation - it need not continue forever."
He gestures to the corpses of the Dragon Army soldiers scattered across the 
hall.
"Others came seeking to use your pain for their purposes. To offer 
you false purpose in service to Takhisis and her Dragon Army. But 
we come offering something different - the possibility of true 
resolution. Of ending this curse with divine grace rather than 
exchanging one form of damnation for another."
"Sir Caradoc told us of the Dragon Army's offer. Of the Starjewel. 
Of their test. We ask your permission to investigate what happened 
to these soldiers, to determine what transpired in the Chapel of the 
Order, and to understand what the Dragon Army truly sought 
here."
Cyrus places his hand over his heart in the Solamnic salute:
"We do not ask you to betray your nature or your oaths. We ask 
only to understand the truth of this place, and if it is within our 
power, to help bring you and your knights the mercy that has been 
denied for so long."
 
LORD SOTH'S RESPONSE
The death knight is silent for a long, terrible moment. The skeletal warriors 
along the walls remain frozen. The ghostly figures hover, watching. The only 
sound is the faint whisper of wind through broken stone.
Then Lord Soth rises from his throne.
The movement is fluid, powerful, despite three centuries of sitting. He stands 
at full height - easily six and a half feet tall in his armor - and the greatsword 
remains in his gauntleted hand, point resting on the stone floor.
He descends the steps from the throne platform, walking toward the three of 
you. Each footfall echoes like a death knell. The cold flames around his armor 
cast dancing shadows across the hall.
He stops twenty feet from the doorway, close enough that you can see the 
details of his armor - once magnificent, now scorched and blackened. The 
symbols of Solamnia are still visible, but twisted, corrupted.
"The Disks have returned."
His voice is hollow, devoid of hope but carrying a terrible weight of longing.
"Three hundred years I have sat in this hall. Three hundred years I 
have listened to the lament of my failure. Three hundred years I 
have waited for the gods to speak, to judge, to grant me either 
redemption or oblivion."
"And in all that time, NO ONE has offered mercy. Only fear. Only 
greed. Only hatred."
He looks directly at Cyrus, the burning points of light in his eye sockets boring 
into the cleric.
"You speak of the Dragon Army's offer. You are correct - they 
promised purpose. An end to meaningless suffering. The chance to 
MATTER again, even in service to darkness."
"But you..." He gestures with the greatsword toward Cyrus's holy 
symbol. "You offer something I had thought impossible. You offer 
HOPE."
The word is spoken with such pain, such desperate hunger, that it's physically 
uncomfortable to hear.
"Hope is the cruelest torture for the damned, priest. Because hope 
can be destroyed. And when it is destroyed, the fall back into 
despair is worse than never hoping at all."
He looks at the scattered corpses of the Dragon Army soldiers.
"These fools came with arrogance and greed. They demanded I 
serve them, that I bow to their Dragon Highlords, that I trade my 
eternal punishment for temporary purpose. I gave them a test - 
retrieve the Starjewel from the Chapel. If they could face Lady 
Korinthe and survive, perhaps they were worthy of commanding 
the damned."
"They failed. She destroyed them. Their screams lasted three days 
before the last one fell silent."
He turns back to Cyrus.
"But YOU... you speak of the gods' return. You speak of mercy. You 
offer investigation, understanding, rather than demands or theft."
"Very well. I grant you permission to enter the Chapel of the Order. 
To investigate what the Dragon Army sought. To face Lady 
Korinthe, if you dare."
"But know this: If you lie to me, if the Disks do not exist, if this is 
deception or manipulation... I will hunt you across Krynn. I will 
find you. And your deaths will make these Dragon Army fools look 
merciful."
"And if you speak truth... if the gods truly have returned... then 
bring proof. Bring the Disks here. Let the gods judge me 
themselves. Let them grant me either redemption or the oblivion I 
have craved for three centuries."
He raises the greatsword in formal salute - knight to knight, warrior to 
warrior.
"You have my permission. The skeletal guardians will not attack 
you. The spirits will let you pass. But Lady Korinthe..." His voice 
becomes almost sad. "She is beyond my control. She is rage and grief 
given form. If you can reach her, if you can survive her, then 
perhaps you truly do serve the gods of mercy."
"The Chapel lies north, through the Gallery of Ancestors. Follow 
the corridor past this hall. You will know when you near it - the air 
grows colder, the walls weep blood, and you will hear her singing."
"Go. Investigate. Survive if you can. And if you do survive, if you 
find what the Dragon Army sought, return to me. We will speak 
further of gods, mercy, and the possibility of ending three hundred 
years of damnation."
He turns and walks back to his throne, each step echoing through the hall. He 
sits, lays the greatsword across his lap, and resumes his eternal vigil - staring 
at nothing, waiting for something that may finally, after three centuries, be 
coming.
The skeletal warriors return to their motionless guard positions. The ghostly 
figures fade back into the shadows.
The path north is open.
 
Cyrus exhales slowly, his hand trembling slightly as he lowers it 
from his heart. "That... that worked. I can't believe that worked."
Kessa whispers: "We just got permission from a death knight to investigate 
his cursed chapel. This is either brilliant or insane."
Johannes, you have Lord Soth's permission and safe passage. The 
path to the Chapel of the Order is clear. What do you want to do?
1.	Proceed immediately to the Chapel - follow the north corridor to 
the Gallery of Ancestors
2.	Investigate the Dragon Army corpses first - see what equipment 
or intelligence they might have
3.	Rest and prepare - Bless has expired, you might want to rebuff before 
facing Lady Korinthe
4.	Ask Lord Soth additional questions - you have his attention, 
perhaps there's more to learn
With Soth's permission, we will examine the bodies. Also, please have Cyrus 
query Soth about the nature of his curse, its cause, and how this involves Lady 
Korinthe. If we do face her, we may have to take steps to protect ourselves. 
We do not wish to dishonor her, her pain, or Soth himself, but we also do not 
wish to bring his wrath should anything happen to the Lady.
Dec 10
EXAMINING THE DRAGON ARMY CORPSES
Johannes approaches the scattered bodies carefully, noting Lord Soth's 
unmoving presence on the throne. The death knight doesn't object as you 
begin your investigation.
Kessa assists with the search (Investigation: 21):
The fifteen corpses are in various states of decay - some reduced to skeletons 
in armor, others partially preserved by the unnatural cold. The manner of 
death is consistent and brutal:
"Crushed. All of them," Kessa reports quietly. "Massive blunt force trauma. 
Broken bones, shattered armor. Whatever killed them hit like a battering ram. 
Multiple victims show signs of being... thrown. Slammed into walls with 
enough force to crack stone."
She examines the dragonborn officer's body - identifiable by his rank insignia. 
"Commander Vraxxis. His spine is shattered, ribs pulverized. He died fast, at 
least."
Equipment recovered:
*	Standard Dragon Army gear (swords, spears, shields) - damaged beyond 
use
*	340 gold pieces total (distributed among the soldiers)
*	Maps of the region (nothing you don't already know)
*	Orders signed by a Dragon Highlord: "Secure alliance with Lord Soth or 
retrieve Starjewel for sanctification. Use of force authorized if 
negotiation fails."
*	A sealed scroll case containing a letter of introduction from "High Cleric 
Moranthas of Takhisis"
*	Holy symbol of Takhisis (silver, worth ~50 gp)
*	Rope, torches, rations (standard expedition gear)
Most importantly: A leather journal belonging to Vraxxis. Kessa flips 
through it:
"Detailed intelligence on Dargaard Keep. Someone gave 
them good information - layout, history, even notes on Lord Soth's personality 
and the curse. The last entry is from seven days ago: 'Soth has agreed to test. 
Will retrieve Starjewel from Chapel. If successful, he joins the cause. For 
Queen Takhisis, for the glory of the Dragon Army.'"
Johannes pockets the journal and orders for later analysis.
 
CYRUS'S INQUIRY TO LORD SOTH
While Johannes and Kessa examine the bodies, Brother Cyrus approaches the 
throne platform - not presumptively close, but near enough to speak 
respectfully.
"My lord, if we are to face Lady Korinthe, we would understand what we're 
walking into. Not to dishonor her or her pain, but to approach with wisdom 
rather than ignorance."
He pauses, choosing his words carefully. "You have granted us permission to 
investigate the Chapel. We do not wish to bring your wrath upon ourselves 
should anything happen to the Lady during our encounter. Can you tell us the 
nature of your curse, its cause, and how Lady Korinthe came to guard the 
Chapel?"
 
LORD SOTH'S ACCOUNT - THE CURSE
The death knight is silent for a long moment, as if deciding whether to speak. 
Then, surprisingly, he does - his voice heavy with centuries of guilt:
"You ask about the curse. Very well. If you are to face her, you 
should understand what made us what we are."
"I was once the finest knight of my generation. Knight of the Rose, 
chosen by Paladine himself. I was noble, honorable, good. I had a 
wife - Gladria - and a son. I had duty, purpose, meaning."
"But I was also proud. And when I met Korinthe..." His voice softens 
almost imperceptibly. "She was an elf maiden, beautiful beyond 
measure. I fell in love with her. And in my pride, in my arrogance, I 
believed I deserved that love more than I deserved my duty."
"I betrayed Gladria. I committed adultery. When Gladria 
discovered the truth, she died - some say by her own hand, some 
say by design. The truth is lost to time and guilt."
"But I married Korinthe. Made her my lady. And we had a son 
together."
The cold flames around his armor flicker more intensely.
"Then the gods sent me a vision. A warning. The Cataclysm was 
coming - divine judgment for the Kingpriest's pride. They gave me a 
quest: ride to Istar, stop the Kingpriest, prevent the catastrophe. I 
could save the world."
"But Gladria's relatives accused me before the Knighthood. They 
claimed I had murdered her to marry Korinthe. They said I was 
unworthy, that my son was illegitimate, that I had broken every 
oath I swore."
"And they convinced Korinthe. They poisoned her against me with 
their lies - or perhaps with truth I refused to see. She believed I had 
murdered my first wife. She believed I was a monster."
"I rode to save her honor, to prove my worthiness. But on the road, 
I hesitated. I turned back. I chose Korinthe over the world."
His voice becomes hollow, dead:
"And that is when the Cataclysm struck."
"The gods threw fire from the heavens. Mountains rose, seas fell, 
cities burned. Millions died. And I could have stopped it. I SHOULD 
have stopped it. But I chose personal love over divine duty."
"When I returned to Dargaard Keep, it was burning. Korinthe was 
trapped in the Chapel with our son and her handmaidens. They 
were burning alive. I tried to save them. I tried. But the flames 
were not natural fire - they were divine judgment, and they would 
not be quenched."
"I listened to her scream my name. I listened to my son cry. I 
listened to them die in agony. And I could do nothing."
"That is when the curse fell. The gods judged me. Not for adultery. 
Not for betrayal. But for choosing personal desire over the world's 
salvation. For failing in my moment of greatest purpose."
"I was condemned to become what I am now - a death knight. 
Immortal, powerful, and forever denied what I desire most: death, 
forgiveness, peace. I am cursed to relive that moment every night. 
To hear Korinthe's screams. To remember my failure."
"And Korinthe..." His voice becomes pained. "She died believing I 
betrayed her. Died in terror and agony. And when she rose as a 
banshee, she rose with that belief intact. She blames me for her 
death. For our son's death. For everything."
"She guards the Chapel because that is where she died. That is 
where the Starjewel rests - the symbol of my supposed honor, now 
corrupted and tainted. She will not let anyone take it. Not the 
Dragon Army. Not you. Not even me."
"If you face her, you face three hundred years of rage, grief, and 
betrayal given supernatural form."
 
LORD SOTH'S WARNING:
"Lady Korinthe's wail can kill. Literally. Those who hear her death 
scream at full force die instantly if their will is not strong enough. 
Her touch drains life itself. She can phase through walls, become 
incorporeal, and she is immune to most forms of harm."
"But she is also trapped by her grief. She believes I murdered 
Gladria. She believes I am a monster. And she is RIGHT to believe 
it, because I AM a monster. But not for the reasons she thinks."
"If you wish to survive her, you cannot fight her with steel alone. 
You must reach through the rage to the woman she was. You must 
make her see truth - not the lies she died believing, not the hatred 
that sustains her, but the actual, terrible truth."
"That I loved her. That I failed her. That I chose her over the world, 
and the world burned because of that choice."
He looks directly at Cyrus:
"If you can make her understand that her death was not murder 
but the consequence of divine judgment for MY sin... if you can 
make her see that she is as much a victim as I am a perpetrator... 
then perhaps, PERHAPS, her rage will falter."
"But I warn you: the truth may not set her free. It may only make 
her angrier. Because the truth is that she died for MY choices, MY 
failures, MY sins. And that is a burden even a banshee's rage 
cannot fully express."
"As for protecting yourselves..." He considers. "Her wail can be 
resisted with strong will. Her touch can be avoided if you are swift. 
And she is a creature of negative energy - radiant damage, holy 
power, these will harm her. But most importantly: if you harm her, 
if you destroy her, I will consider it an attack upon what remains of 
the woman I loved. And you will answer to me."
"So you face an impossible choice: survive her without destroying 
her. Reach her without breaking her. Or die trying."
He gestures toward the north corridor:
"The Gallery of Ancestors lies that way. Follow it to its end. You will 
find the Chapel. And you will find Lady Korinthe, singing her 
eternal lament."
"If you survive, return to me. If you do not..." A pause. "Your bodies 
will join the others. And I will continue waiting."
 
The information is laid bare. You know the curse, you know Lady 
Korinthe's nature, and you know the stakes.
Cyrus looks shaken. "He's asking us to face a banshee powerful enough to 
kill fifteen Dragon Army soldiers, survive her wail and her rage, and somehow 
reach through three hundred years of pain to help her... without destroying 
her."
Kessa: "And if we hurt her, Soth kills us. No pressure."
Johannes, what's your plan? Do you want to:
1.	Proceed immediately to the Gallery - while the information is 
fresh
2.	Prepare and buff - Bless has long expired, you might want Protection 
from Evil and Good, Death Ward, etc.
3.	Discuss strategy - how exactly do you approach a banshee without 
fighting her?
4.	Ask Lord Soth anything else - any final questions before you go?
Any final insights before we face her? Is there anything you would have us tell 
her, even if she is not capable of hearing them?
Dec 10
LORD SOTH'S FINAL WORDS
The death knight rises from his throne once more - a gesture of respect for the 
question, perhaps, or simply the weight of what he's about to say.
He walks to the edge of the platform, looking down at the three of you. The 
cold flames around his armor dim slightly, and for just a moment, you can 
almost see the knight he once was beneath the curse.
"What would I have you tell her?"
His voice is quieter now, almost human in its pain:
"Tell her... tell her I am sorry. Not the empty apology of a man 
seeking forgiveness, but the acknowledgment of one who truly 
understands what was taken from her."
"Tell her that she was right to hate me. That her rage is justified. 
That I DID fail her, though not in the way she believes."
"Tell her that our son - Peradur - died calling for both of us. That 
his last word was not a curse, but a child's cry for his parents. Tell 
her that I heard him. That I will always hear him."
He pauses, the burning points of light in his eye sockets dimming:
"Tell her that if I could trade places with her, if I could bear her 
curse instead of my own, I would do so without hesitation. Not to 
ease my own suffering, but to ease hers."
"Tell her that she deserved better than me. Better than this. Better 
than three hundred years of rage in a chapel where she died in 
terror."
"And tell her..." His voice becomes almost a whisper, "...that I loved her. 
Truly loved her. And that love was not a lie, even if everything else 
was built on betrayal and failure. The love was real. The love 
was good. And the love is why I failed the world - because in that 
moment, I chose her over everything else."
"Tell her that her death is my greatest punishment. Not the curse, 
not the immortality, not the flames or the endless guilt. But 
knowing that she died believing I murdered her. That she died in 
pain, calling my name in fear rather than love. THAT is my 
damnation."
He returns to his throne slowly, as if the weight of these words has exhausted 
even an undead warrior.
"But Johannes Constantinius..." He looks at you directly. "Know this: 
she may not be capable of hearing. Banshees are creatures of 
singular purpose, locked into the moment of their death and the 
emotion that killed them. Three hundred years of rage and grief 
have calcified around her soul like armor."
"Your words may not reach her. Your compassion may not 
penetrate. And if they do not, if she attacks with full fury, you must 
make a choice: die with honor, or survive by any means necessary 
and face my wrath afterward."
"I do not envy you this task. It is crueler than anything I have faced 
in three centuries."
He gestures one final time toward the north corridor:
"Go. Face what I created through my failures. And if you survive, if 
you somehow reach her, if you can do what I could not... then 
perhaps there is hope for both of us."
"May the gods you serve grant you wisdom I never possessed. You 
will need it."
 
FINAL PREPARATIONS
The path north is clear. Lord Soth has said all he will say. The skeletal warriors 
stand motionless. The ghostly figures watch from the shadows with something 
that might be curiosity or pity.
Cyrus takes a deep breath. "We should prepare. Fully. Lady Korinthe is... 
this is going to be the hardest thing we've ever done. We're not fighting an 
enemy. We're trying to reach a victim through centuries of trauma."
Kessa: "And if we fail, we either die to her wail, or we hurt her and Soth kills 
us. Johannes, we need every advantage we can get."
AVAILABLE PREPARATION OPTIONS:
1.	Cyrus can cast buffs:
*	Bless (concentration, +1d4 to attacks and saves for all three)
*	Death Ward (4th level, target doesn't die from next instance of 
damage that would reduce them to 0 HP)
*	Protection from Evil and Good (advantage on saves vs undead, 
they have disadvantage to hit you)
*	Aid (increases max HP for all three)
2.	Consume resources:
*	Holy Water (3 vials available, 2d6 radiant damage to undead)
*	Potions of Healing (emergency backup)
*	Blessed symbols (advantage vs fear effects)
3.	Strategic discussion:
*	Who speaks to Korinthe?
*	What's the approach - immediate dialogue or cautious entry?
*	What's the emergency retreat plan if things go catastrophically 
wrong?
How do you want to prepare, and what's your strategy for 
approaching Lady Korinthe?
Suggestions, guys?
Dec 10
PARTY STRATEGY DISCUSSION
The three of you move to a corner of the Great Hall, speaking in low voices 
while Lord Soth remains motionless on his throne.
 
CYRUS'S RECOMMENDATIONS:
"We need to maximize our survivability and our chances of being heard. 
Here's what I'm thinking:"
Buffs:
*	Death Ward on all three of us - "Her wail can kill instantly. This 
gives each of us one guaranteed save from death. It's our insurance 
policy." (Uses both 4th-level slots, would need to choose who gets the 
third)
*	Bless - "The +1d4 to saving throws could be the difference between 
resisting her wail or dying."
*	Protection from Evil and Good on Johannes - "You'll be doing 
the talking. You need advantage on saves against her, and she'll have 
disadvantage attacking you. It's concentration, so I can't stack it with 
Bless, but if you're the primary target..."
Approach: "Johannes should speak. You made the connection with Caradoc, 
you negotiated with Soth. You have the diplomatic instinct. I'll support with 
spiritual authority, but this needs to be personal, human connection, not just 
priestly platitudes."
"Kessa and I should stay back initially - not cowering, but not threatening. Let 
Johannes try to reach her first. If she attacks, we react, but our goal is survival 
and retreat, not combat."
Emergency Plan: "If she unleashes her full wail, if multiple people drop, we 
RUN. Grab whoever fell, use Healing Word to get them conscious, and we 
retreat to the Great Hall. Soth gave us permission to try - he didn't demand we 
succeed or die. There's no shame in recognizing when we're outmatched."
 
KESSA'S TACTICAL ASSESSMENT:
"I hate everything about this, but here's my thinking:"
Positioning: "Banshees can phase through walls and become incorporeal. 
There's no 'safe' position. But we should enter spread out - at least 15-20 feet 
between us. Her wail has an area effect. If we're spread, maybe not all of us get 
hit at once."
My Role: "I'm not the diplomat. I'm not the holy warrior. But I'm fast, and I 
have the Ring of Feather Falling. If this goes wrong, if someone drops, I can 
reach them quickly, grab them, and we can retreat down whatever vertical 
surface we need to."
"Also..." She hefts her hand crossbow. "If - IF - it comes to combat and Soth's 
permission somehow extends to defending ourselves, I can provide ranged 
support. But that's absolute last resort."
Reading the Room: "When we enter, I'll be watching her, not speaking. 
Body language, reactions, emotional cues. If Johannes's words are reaching 
her, I'll see it. If she's about to attack, I'll see it. I'll signal if we need to shift 
strategy."
One More Thing: "We wear the blessed symbols openly. They might help 
with her fear effects, but more importantly, they show we're here with divine 
backing. We're not grave robbers or Dragon Army thugs. We're here with 
purpose."
 
KESSA'S QUESTION:
"Johannes, one thing I need to know: Are you planning to tell her about the 
Disks? About the possibility of ending the curse? Because that could go two 
ways - it could give her hope, or it could make her angrier that three hundred 
years of suffering might have been preventable."
 
CYRUS'S ADDITION:
"One more tactical note: Banshee wails target creatures within 30 feet who 
can hear her. If things go catastrophically wrong immediately, we could 
theoretically use Silence to create a zone where her wail doesn't work. But that 
also means we can't speak to her in that zone, so it's purely defensive."
"Also, I'll have Lesser Restoration prepared in case she causes fear effects that 
linger, and Mass Healing Word if multiple people drop. But honestly..." He 
looks grim. "If her wail hits multiple people at once, we're probably done. Our 
best defense is not getting hit in the first place."
 
FINAL RESOURCE ALLOCATION:
Cyrus proposes:
*	Death Ward on Johannes (you're speaking, you're primary target)
*	Death Ward on Cyrus (healer needs to stay alive)
*	Bless on all three (concentration, +1d4 to saves)
*	Save 3rd-level slots for emergency Mass Healing Word or Dispel 
Magic
*	Everyone wears blessed symbols openly
*	Holy water ready but not drawn (don't appear threatening)
"This uses my two 4th-level slots, but it gives us the best chance of surviving 
an instant-kill effect. Kessa, you don't get Death Ward because you're fastest 
and most likely to avoid being primary target. Is that acceptable?"
 
Kessa nods: "I'm good with that. I'll stay mobile, stay alert, and be ready to 
extract if needed."
Both look to Johannes:
"What do you think? Any changes to the buff package? Any specific approach 
you want to take when we enter the Chapel? And are you planning to mention 
the Disks to her?"
Johannes, what's your final strategy?
Actually, hear me out on this. We are dealing with trauma, personal hurt so 
deep it lives beyond death. So this really has nothing to do with Soth. He's 
right; she can't hear him, can't hear any of us. She is trapped in her own vision. 
And that is what has to break. So...what if we were to show her that? I am 
thinking Illusions - mirrors that alternate between her former self and her 
current state. Let her see what her grief has done to her, what it has taken, and 
what it has left behind. Everywhere she turns. Not as accusation, not as 
punishment, but as truth. Truth is the greatest weapon against guilt, against 
pain, because it is real. Immutable. And her grief is, in the end, not truth. It is 
only a facet, a specific perspective. And as such, it doesn't not qualify as truth.
Dec 10
PARTY REACTION TO JOHANNES'S STRATEGY
There's a moment of stunned silence as both companions process what 
Johannes just proposed.
CYRUS'S RESPONSE:
Cyrus's eyes widen, and he grips his holy symbol tightly. "That's... that's either 
brilliant or catastrophically dangerous. Maybe both."
He thinks it through aloud:
"You're right that words alone won't reach her. She's locked in the moment of 
her death, reliving her trauma eternally. Talking at her won't break that cycle - 
she can't hear past her own pain."
"But showing her... forcing her to see herself, to confront what she's become 
versus what she was... that bypasses the verbal. It's direct. Visceral."
He pauses, concern creeping into his voice:
"The risk is that it could enrage her further. Seeing what she's become, seeing 
the beauty she lost, the life that was stolen - it could amplify her grief into fury. 
She might see it as mockery rather than compassion."
"But..." He looks at Johannes with growing conviction. "From a theological 
perspective, this is actually sound. Banshees are trapped by their death-
moment, by a singular fixed perspective. Breaking that perspective, forcing 
them to see beyond the loop they're in - that's how curses break. Not through 
force, but through revelation."
Practical consideration: "You'd need illusions she can't immediately 
dismiss or ignore. Silent Image won't work - she'd see through it instantly. 
You'd need something more real, more undeniable. Major Image would work 
- it has sound, it can move, and it requires an Investigation check to disbelieve. 
But..." He hesitates. "Do you have access to illusion magic? That's not typically 
warlock territory."
 
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT:
Kessa has been listening intently, and she nods slowly. "I hate to say it, but 
Johannes is right. We can't tell her she's trapped. We have to show her."
"Think about it: she died three hundred years ago in terror and pain. She's 
been replaying that moment over and over. Every time she looks around, she 
sees the burning chapel, feels the flames, hears her son crying. That's her 
entire reality."
"If we can show her something different - show her what she was before, show 
her what she's become, show her that there's a reality beyond that single 
moment - it might crack the loop. It might give her perspective."
Tactical refinement: "Here's what I'm thinking: we don't just show her 
images of herself. We show her progression. Start with who she was - Lady 
Korinthe, beautiful, alive, loved. Then show the moment of death - the fire, the 
terror, but also the truth of it being the Cataclysm, not murder. Then show 
what she's become - the banshee, the rage, the three hundred years of 
isolation."
"Make it a narrative. Show her the whole story, not just fragments. Let her see 
the through-line from life to death to undeath. Let her see that her grief has 
trapped her in one moment when there's an entire history she's forgotten."
Kessa's concern: "But Johannes is right - this has to be truth, not 
accusation. We're not saying 'look what you've become, you monster.' We're 
saying 'look at the fullness of your story. See all of it, not just the worst 
moment.'"
 
CYRUS'S SPIRITUAL INSIGHT:
"There's another layer to this," Cyrus adds quietly. "Lady Korinthe believes 
Soth murdered Gladria and then came for her. That's the lie she died 
believing. If we can show her the actual sequence of events - Soth's choice, the 
Cataclysm, the divine judgment, the flames that consumed her - we show her 
she wasn't murdered. She was a casualty of cosmic consequence."
"That doesn't make it better. She still died horribly. Her son still died. But it 
changes the meaning. She's not a murdered victim. She's a tragic casualty of 
Soth's failure to save the world. That's truth. And truth can set people free, 
even the dead."
CRITICAL QUESTION:
"Johannes, you're a warlock. Do you have illusion magic available? Or were 
you thinking we find another way to create these reflections?"
 
ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES IF NO ILLUSION MAGIC:
Cyrus: "If you don't have illusion spells, we could try other methods:
*	I could use Thaumaturgy to create minor sensory effects - echoes of her 
voice when she was alive, flickering images
*	We could speak the story aloud while invoking her memories, painting 
word-pictures
*	There might be actual mirrors in the Chapel - reflective surfaces that 
could show her what she's become contrasted with what she was"
Kessa: "Or we focus on bringing objects that connect to her past. Soth 
mentioned the Starjewel was important to him - were there items important 
to her? Things that remind her of life before death?"
 
THE STRATEGY CRYSTALLIZES:
Core approach: Use reflection - literal or magical - to break Korinthe's 
death-loop by showing her the fullness of her story, forcing perspective 
beyond the single traumatic moment.
Johannes, the questions are:
1.	Do you have access to illusion magic (through spells, items, or 
other means)?
2.	If not, which alternative approach appeals to you - verbal 
narrative, sensory effects, physical mirrors, symbolic objects?
3.	Do you still want the defensive buffs (Death Ward, Bless) in case 
this goes wrong?
4.	Who creates/presents the reflections - Johannes alone, or 
collaborative effort?
What's your refined plan?
All I have is Minor Illusion. But could that be enough? Passing images as we 
speak to her, our words made life?
Dec 10
CYRUS'S EVALUATION OF MINOR ILLUSION
Cyrus considers this carefully, his scholarly mind working through the magical 
theory:
"Minor Illusion... it's limited. A 5-foot cube, static image or sound, no 
movement. But..." His expression shifts. "But used repeatedly, in sequence, 
like pages in a book..."
He looks at Johannes with growing excitement. "Yes. Yes, this could work. 
Here's why:"
THE STRATEGY WITH MINOR ILLUSION:
"You cast it again and again - each casting creates a new still image that lasts 
one minute. You build a gallery of images around her, one after another. Not a 
single moving illusion, but a series of frozen moments that surround her, that 
she cannot escape or ignore."
Sequence of images:
1.	Korinthe alive - beautiful, smiling, radiant. Before the tragedy.
2.	Soth and Korinthe together - the love that was real, even if flawed.
3.	Their son, Peradur - innocent, alive. The life she protected.
4.	The Cataclysm moment - fire falling from the heavens. Divine 
judgment, not murder.
5.	The Chapel burning - showing the cosmic scale, the world breaking, 
not personal betrayal.
6.	Korinthe now - the banshee, wreathed in ethereal fury. What three 
hundred years of grief has made her.
7.	The choice - two images side by side. The woman she was, the creature 
she's become. Past and present.
Kessa interjects: "And while you're creating these images, we speak. We 
narrate the truth. Your illusions give the words form. They become a story she 
can see while she hears. It bypasses her ability to shut us out verbally because 
the images force her to confront what we're saying."
 
CYRUS'S REFINEMENT:
"Here's the critical tactical element: Minor Illusion requires concentration, 
but each casting creates an image that persists. So you cast, the image appears, 
you drop concentration, cast again, new image. You can create multiple 
images simultaneously in the space because you're not maintaining them - 
they exist independently once created."
"It's like... hanging paintings in a gallery. Each one stays until you deliberately 
dismiss it or until the minute duration expires. You could theoretically fill the 
Chapel with seven or eight images, creating an immersive experience she 
cannot escape."
Timing consideration: "Each casting takes an action - six seconds. Seven 
images means 42 seconds of casting time. During that time, you're vulnerable. 
So here's what I propose:"
REVISED TACTICAL APPROACH:
Phase 1 - Entry and Assessment (First 30 seconds):
*	All three enter the Chapel together, spread out (20 feet between each)
*	Cyrus casts Bless immediately (bonus action) - all three get +1d4 to 
saves
*	We announce ourselves respectfully: "Lady Korinthe, we come bearing 
truth and witness"
*	Johannes begins casting Minor Illusion - first image appears
*	We assess her immediate reaction - does she attack instantly, or does 
curiosity/confusion give us a moment?
Phase 2 - Gallery Creation (Next 45 seconds):
*	Johannes continues casting Minor Illusion sequentially, building the 
gallery of images
*	Cyrus and Kessa position defensively, ready to intervene if she attacks
*	We speak while the images appear, narrating the story: "You were Lady 
Korinthe, beloved and beautiful..." (first image appears) "...you loved 
Lord Soth, and that love was real..." (second image appears)
*	Goal: complete 6-7 images before she can fully process and respond
Phase 3 - Revelation (Final minute):
*	All images present, surrounding her
*	Johannes delivers Lord Soth's message directly: his apology, his 
acknowledgment, his love
*	We emphasize: "You are trapped in one moment. But your story is 
larger. See the fullness of what was, what is, and what could be."
*	We offer hope: "The gods have returned. The Disks of Mishakal exist. 
This curse can end."
Emergency Protocols:
*	If she attacks during Phase 1-2, Cyrus casts Death Ward on whoever she 
targets (reaction, uses spell slot)
*	If she unleashes her wail, we make saves with Bless bonus, Death Ward 
catches anyone who fails
*	If multiple people drop, immediate retreat - Kessa grabs fallen, we run
 
KESSA'S ADDITION:
"One more thing: as Johannes creates images, I'll watch her. If an image 
affects her - if she recoils, if she reaches toward it, if she shows any emotional 
response - I'll signal which one hit home. Then you can emphasize that 
moment verbally, reinforce what's breaking through."
"We're essentially forcing her to witness her own story from the outside. To 
see herself as we see her - not as a monster, but as a victim of circumstances 
beyond her control who has agency to choose differently now."
 
CYRUS'S SPIRITUAL FRAMING:
"And here's the theological key: we're not fixing her. We're not curing her. 
We're offering perspective. The choice to change, to release the rage, to accept 
truth over the lie she died believing - that has to be hers. We can only 
illuminate the path. She has to choose to walk it."
"If she chooses continued rage... we retreat. If she chooses to listen... maybe, 
just maybe, we achieve what three hundred years couldn't."
 
FINAL BUFFS BEFORE ENTRY:
Cyrus proposes:
*	Bless on all three (cast immediately upon entry, lasts 1 minute - covers 
the entire encounter)
*	Death Ward held in reserve as emergency reaction (can cast as needed 
if someone's about to drop)
*	Blessed symbols worn openly
*	Holy water accessible but not drawn
*	3rd and 4th level slots preserved for emergency healing/protection
Total resource commitment: 1st level slot for Bless, potentially 4th level 
for Death Ward if needed
 
Cyrus and Kessa both look at Johannes:
"This is your plan. Your vision. We'll support you completely. But you need to 
be ready to cast seven times in quick succession while maintaining composure 
and speaking truth to a banshee. Can you do this?"
Kessa adds: "And one final question: what specifically do you want each 
image to show? We should agree on the sequence now so we're all aligned 
when we speak the narrative."
Johannes, are you ready to commit to this approach? And what 
specific moments do you want each Minor Illusion to depict?
Let's do it, as discussed. In the order and manner discussed. There should be 
enough paintings and portraits in the area that we can get a sense of who she 
was in life. We also include images of her son, but nothing of Soth.
Dec 10
FINAL PREPARATION
"Nothing of Soth," Cyrus agrees. "This is about her story, not his. He's a part 
of the context, but she needs to see herself, her son, her own journey. Smart."
Kessa nods. "Let's scout the Gallery of Ancestors on the way - if there are 
portraits of the family, we can reference them for accuracy. The more true the 
images are, the more they'll resonate."
 
BUFFS APPLIED:
Before leaving the Great Hall, Cyrus prepares the party:
Cast now:
*	Blessed symbols worn openly by all three
*	Equipment check complete
*	Mental preparation
Cast upon Chapel entry:
*	Bless (immediate, all three, +1d4 to attack rolls and saves)
Held in reserve:
*	Death Ward (emergency only, whoever needs it)
*	Mass Healing Word (if multiple people drop)
*	Holy Water (accessible but not threatening)
 
LEAVING THE GREAT HALL
The three of you turn toward the north corridor. As you walk past Lord Soth's 
throne, the death knight remains motionless, but his voice carries across the 
hall one final time:
"You go to face what I could not save. What I created through my 
failure."
A pause.
"If you succeed... if you reach her... tell her I will wait. For as long 
as it takes. For redemption, for oblivion, or simply for the gods to 
finally judge us both."
The skeletal warriors along the walls raise their swords in silent salute as you 
pass - a gesture of respect from those who know what you're about to attempt.
 
GALLERY OF ANCESTORS
The north corridor from the Great Hall is grand but decayed - 15 feet wide, 
lined with alcoves that once held statues and displays. The Cataclysm 
destroyed most, but fragments remain.
After 60 feet, the corridor opens into the Gallery of Ancestors - a long hall 
(80 feet by 30 feet) with high vaulted ceilings. The walls are lined with 
portraits, though many have been damaged by fire, water, and time.
What remains visible:
Portraits of Solamnic Knights - generations of warriors, all in formal 
armor, all bearing the symbols of the Knighthood. Most are too damaged to 
identify.
One large portrait, partially intact - clearly Lord Soth in his prime. 
Young, handsome, confident. The image shows him before the fall - before the 
curse, before the tragedy. A knight at the height of his glory.
Three portraits that survived relatively intact:
1.	Lady Korinthe (full-length portrait, 6 feet tall) - An elven woman of 
extraordinary beauty. Dark hair, luminous eyes, elegant bearing. She 
wears a flowing gown in deep blue, and there's a circlet of silver in her 
hair. She's smiling - not a formal portrait smile, but genuine warmth. 
One hand rests on her heart, the other extends outward in a gesture of 
welcome or blessing. The painting radiates grace and life.
2.	Korinthe with infant (smaller portrait, 3 feet tall) - She holds a baby 
wrapped in white cloth, looking down at him with pure maternal love. 
The child's face is barely visible, but you can see dark hair and tiny 
hands reaching toward her face. The tenderness in the image is 
heartbreaking.
3.	Young boy, perhaps 4-5 years old (portrait, 4 feet tall) - Dark-
haired child with elven features and his mother's luminous eyes. He's 
wearing a small noble's outfit and holding a wooden sword, clearly 
playing at being a knight. He's laughing. This must be Peradur, their 
son.
Kessa studies the portraits carefully (Perception: 22): "These are... these 
are good references. The artist captured not just appearance but personality. 
Look at her expression - that's not formal nobility, that's genuine warmth. And 
the boy... gods, he's just a child."
Cyrus stands before Korinthe's portrait for a long moment. "She was 
beautiful. Not just physically - you can see the kindness in her eyes, the 
openness. This is who we're trying to reach. This is who's trapped beneath 
three hundred years of rage."
Johannes can study these portraits to inform his Minor Illusion 
castings - you now have clear visual reference for:
*	Korinthe's appearance (facial features, clothing, bearing, expression)
*	Her relationship with her son (the maternal bond)
*	Peradur's appearance (young, innocent, full of life)
 
THE CHAPEL DOOR
At the far end of the Gallery, the corridor narrows to a single doorway. The 
door is intact but slightly ajar - ornate oak with silver inlay showing symbols of 
Paladine. The symbols are tarnished and corrupted, but still recognizable.
Cold air seeps through the gap. Colder than anywhere else in the keep. Your 
breath mists heavily.
And you can hear it now - clearly, unmistakably:
Singing.
A woman's voice, ethereal and haunting, singing in Elvish. The melody is 
the Lament of Isolation - the funeral dirge for those who die without honor. 
But the voice carries such pain, such longing, such fury that it's almost 
physically uncomfortable to hear.
The words, translated, speak of betrayal, of fire, of a child's scream, of love 
turned to ash.
Kessa whispers: "She's in there. Right now. Singing."
Cyrus grips his holy symbol: "Last chance to change the plan. Are we 
doing this?"
The door is 10 feet ahead. Beyond it lies the Chapel of the Order, 
Lady Korinthe, and the test of whether truth and compassion can 
reach through three centuries of grief.
Johannes, do you:
1.	Enter immediately - push the door open, commit fully
2.	Take one more moment - final words with companions, final mental 
preparation
3.	Approach differently - announce yourselves before entering, knock, 
something else
What are your final actions before entering the Chapel?
Do it.
Dec 10
ENTERING THE CHAPEL
Johannes pushes the door open.
The hinges don't creak - they're silent, as if the keep itself wants to witness 
what happens next.
 
THE CHAPEL OF THE ORDER
The chamber beyond is roughly 50 feet long and 30 feet wide. Unlike the rest 
of the keep, this space is almost perfectly preserved - as if frozen in the 
moment of the Cataclysm.
What you see:
*	Stone altar at the far end (north wall), still intact, with symbols of 
Paladine carved into it
*	Pews arranged in neat rows, facing the altar - charred but standing
*	Stained glass windows on the east and west walls - shattered, but 
fragments remain showing scenes of knightly virtue
*	Scorch marks everywhere - walls, floor, ceiling - but these aren't 
random. They form patterns, like reaching hands, like grasping flames
*	The Starjewel rests on the altar - a fist-sized gem in a silver setting, 
glowing with sickly green-black light. Once holy, now corrupted.
And floating before the altar, Lady Korinthe.
 
LADY KORINTHE - THE BANSHEE
She hovers three feet above the ground, translucent and ethereal. You can see 
through her to the altar beyond, but she's present in a way that defies the 
semi-corporeal form.
She wears the same flowing gown from the portrait, but it's tattered, burned, 
moving in an unfelt wind. Her dark hair floats around her head like she's 
underwater. Her face...
Her face is beautiful and terrible. The same features from the portrait - the 
luminous eyes, the graceful bone structure - but twisted by grief and rage. Her 
eyes burn with cold blue-white fire. Her mouth is open in song, and when she 
sings, frost forms in the air.
Her hands are extended toward the altar, as if reaching for something that 
isn't there. Or perhaps reaching for her son, who died here.
She doesn't notice you immediately. She's lost in her song, in her eternal 
moment, replaying the death over and over.
 
INITIATIVE
The three of you enter in formation:
*	Cyrus (center, 10 feet inside the door)
*	Johannes (left, 10 feet inside, 20 feet from Cyrus)
*	Kessa (right, 10 feet inside, 20 feet from Cyrus)
Spread out, as planned. Blessed symbols visible.
CYRUS ACTS IMMEDIATELY (Bonus Action):
He raises his holy symbol and casts Bless: "Mishakal, grant us your grace."
Golden light flows from the symbol, touching all three of you. You feel warmth 
despite the cold, clarity despite the fear.
[All three: +1d4 to attack rolls and saving throws for 1 minute]
 
KORINTHE NOTICES
The moment Cyrus's divine magic manifests, her singing stops.
The silence is absolute.
She turns - slowly, like a predator locating prey - and sees the three of you.
Her expression shifts from grief to confusion to fury in the span of a 
heartbeat.
"INTRUDERS."
Her voice is layered - multiple tones at once, as if several versions of her are 
speaking in harmony. The sound reverberates in your bones.
"You DARE enter this place? You DARE stand where my son DIED? 
Where I BURNED?"
She floats forward ten feet, her hands curling into claws. The temperature 
drops another ten degrees. Frost spreads across the floor from where she 
hovers.
"The others came seeking POWER. Seeking to STEAL what is 
MINE. They died screaming. YOU will join them."
 
THIS IS THE MOMENT
She hasn't attacked yet - she's speaking, which means there's a window. But 
that window is closing fast. Her rage is building visibly.
JOHANNES - YOUR TURN
You need to act now. Cast Minor Illusion, speak truth, begin the gallery before 
she unleashes her wail.
What is the FIRST image you create, and what do you say as you 
cast it?
The floor is yours. Cyrus and Kessa are positioned defensively, ready to 
support or react. But this moment - this critical first impression - belongs to 
Johannes.
What do you do?
"What was it that was yours, My Lady? This? Your youth and beauty? I project 
the first image.
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S OPENING MOVE
Johannes raises his hand, his voice steady and respectful despite the 
supernatural terror before him. He casts Minor Illusion.
FIRST IMAGE APPEARS (5-foot cube, to Korinthe's left, 10 feet from her):
Lady Korinthe as she was in life - the portrait come to three dimensions. 
Beautiful, radiant, dark hair cascading down, wearing the elegant blue gown. 
She's smiling that genuine, warm smile. One hand over her heart, the other 
extended in welcome. Alive. Whole. Real.
The image is still, frozen in that moment of grace and life.
 
KORINTHE'S REACTION
She whips her head toward the image, her ethereal form shuddering. The rage 
in her expression falters - just for an instant - replaced by confusion, then 
recognition, then anguish.
"What... what is this... trickery?"
Her voice cracks, the multiple tones becoming discordant. She stares at the 
image of herself, her translucent hand reaching toward it but not touching.
"That was... I was..."
Then the rage returns, defensive, protective:
"You mock me! You show me what was STOLEN! What the flames 
TOOK!"
But she doesn't look away from the image. She can't look away.
 
JOHANNES - YOUR ACTION CONTINUES
You have her attention. The image has pierced through the immediate fury. 
She's engaged, even if it's painful engagement.
What is the SECOND image you create, and what do you say?
Reminder: You can cast Minor Illusion again as an action (6 seconds). The 
first image persists for 1 minute. You're building the gallery sequentially.
Cyrus and Kessa hold position, watching her reaction, ready to 
intervene if needed.
Continue, Johannes. What's the next piece of truth you show her?
"Never, my Lady. I mock nothing. But this" I gesture at the image, " this wasn't 
the truth, was it? You knew change, your youth was only yours for a time. But 
as time passed, other things came, Things even more beautiful. Like this." You 
show her her son.
Dec 10
SECOND IMAGE APPEARS
Johannes casts Minor Illusion again, creating a second image to Korinthe's 
right, opposite the first.
The boy - Peradur - perhaps four years old, dark-haired with his mother's 
luminous eyes. Wearing his small noble's outfit, holding the wooden sword, 
caught mid-laugh. Pure joy, pure innocence, pure life. A child who knew he 
was loved.
The image stands there, frozen in that moment of childhood happiness.
 
KORINTHE'S REACTION
The effect is immediate and devastating.
She makes a sound - not words, but a wail of pure grief that isn't her death 
scream, just raw maternal anguish. She moves toward the image of her son, 
her translucent hands reaching, grasping at air.
"Peradur... my son... my baby..."
All the rage drains from her voice, replaced by heartbreak so profound it's 
almost tangible. She tries to touch the image, her hands passing through it 
uselessly.
"He was so young. So small. He called for me. In the flames, he 
called for me, and I couldn't... I couldn't reach him..."
She's weeping now - if banshees can weep. No tears fall, but her form 
shudders, the ethereal gown rippling with the force of her grief.
"He died afraid. He died calling my name. And I could do 
NOTHING."
She turns back toward you, and the rage is returning, but it's different now - 
not directed at you, but at the universe, at the injustice:
"Soth did this. Soth brought the flames. Soth murdered Gladria 
and brought divine judgment on us all. My son paid for HIS sins!"
 
CRITICAL MOMENT
She's engaged. She's feeling. But she's still locked in her narrative - that Soth 
murdered Gladria, that he's to blame, that she and Peradur were victims of his 
personal evil rather than cosmic consequence.
This is where you need to pivot. To show her the truth of what happened.
JOHANNES - YOUR NEXT MOVE
What is the THIRD image, and how do you bridge from her 
maternal grief to the larger truth about the Cataclysm?
You're doing exactly what you planned - breaking through her rage to the 
grief beneath. Now comes the harder part: showing her that her 
understanding of events is incomplete.
Cyrus and Kessa remain positioned, watching intently. Cyrus's 
hand is on his holy symbol, ready to support if needed.
Continue, Johannes. Show her the truth.
"But, my Lady, truth is greater than ourselves, isn't it? There is more than just 
what WE see, what WE hear, isn't there. The birds sing, just as sweetly, even if 
we are not beneath them circling in the sky. The scent of the rose floats on the 
breeze, even if our noses cannot catch it in the springtime? Yes, your 
experience was as tragic as any in known memory, but it was not the full 
extent of pain, of loss, was it?" I show images of the Cataclysm, of other 
mothers, other children, other innocents lost.
Dec 10
THIRD IMAGE - FOURTH IMAGE - FIFTH IMAGE
Johannes casts Minor Illusion three more times in quick succession, creating 
a panorama of devastation:
Third image (behind Korinthe, forcing her to turn): A city burning - not 
Dargaard Keep, but Istar, or any of a dozen cities. Buildings collapsing. The 
sky itself falling. Mountains rising where plains once stood. The 
world breaking.
Fourth image (to her left): Another mother, another child - humans, 
clutching each other as fire falls from the heavens. Their expressions mirror 
Korinthe's own terror. Different faces, same tragedy.
Fifth image (to her right): More victims - a family huddled together, an 
elderly couple, a young woman alone. All consumed by the same cosmic fire. 
All dying in the same moment across Krynn.
The images surround her now - five frozen moments of the Cataclysm's 
devastation. A gallery of universal suffering.
 
KORINTHE'S REACTION
She spins, looking from image to image, her ethereal form becoming more 
agitated. She sees herself reflected in these other victims - the same terror, the 
same pain, the same innocence destroyed.
"No... no, this is... this was..."
Her voice wavers, the multiple tones becoming uncertain.
"The Cataclysm. The gods' judgment. I remember... the world 
shook. The sky burned. But..."
She looks back at the image of herself alive, then at Peradur, then at the 
burning victims.
"But Soth... he BROUGHT this. He murdered Gladria, he broke his 
vows, he-"
She stops, confusion breaking through the certainty.
"They told me... Gladria's family, they told me he was a murderer. 
That he killed her to have me. That he was corrupt, fallen, 
unworthy..."
Her hands clench and unclench.
"And then the flames came. And he couldn't save us. He stood 
outside and let us BURN. If he loved me, if he was good, he would 
have saved us!"
The rage is returning, but it's defensive now - protecting the narrative she's 
clung to for three centuries because without it, what does her suffering mean?
"Tell me, priest!" She turns toward Cyrus, her voice desperate and 
furious. "Tell me my death meant something! Tell me it was 
MURDER, not just... not just CHANCE! Not just being in the wrong 
place when the gods decided to punish the WORLD!"
 
CRITICAL PIVOT POINT
She's almost there. She's seeing the larger context. But she's resisting because 
if her death wasn't personal - if it wasn't about her, wasn't someone's fault - 
then it was just random cosmic tragedy. And that's somehow worse.
She needs to understand: it WAS personal, but not in the way she thinks.
JOHANNES - NEXT MOVE
This is where you show her Soth's actual choice. Not murder, but a 
different kind of betrayal. The sixth image should show the truth: 
Soth on the road, turning back, choosing her over the world.
What do you create, and what do you say to bridge from "random 
tragedy" to "consequence of choice"?
You're breaking through. Keep going. Cyrus and Kessa are watching, ready 
to support.
"My lady. None of us are ever capable of doing ALL that lies within our power 
to do. We all fall short. Even your husband," an image of him , turning from 
Istar, returning to be by her side, turning from his very oaths out of love for 
her. And then of him, failing to break through the door, body wreathed in fire 
as he is on his knees before the Chapel doors. "But how can we judge the 
failings within ourselves, within others, when we know we cannot know all 
things? As mortals, it falls beyond us. It is the duty and obligations of the 
Gods, is it not?"
Dec 10
SIXTH IMAGE - SEVENTH IMAGE
Johannes casts Minor Illusion twice more, completing the narrative:
Sixth image (central, impossible to ignore): Lord Soth on horseback on a 
mountain road, turning away from a distant city (Istar). His posture shows the 
weight of decision - shoulders slumped, head bowed. Not triumphant, not 
malicious. Just... choosing. Choosing her over the world. Choosing love over 
duty.
Seventh image (directly before the altar, between Korinthe and the 
Starjewel): Soth on his knees before the Chapel doors, the same doors you just 
entered through. His armor is wreathed in flames - divine fire, the same fire 
that consumed everything. His gauntleted hands are on the door, pushing, 
trying desperately to break through. Failing. The image captures his anguish, 
his helplessness. A knight who could break armies, unable to save the ones he 
loved most.
 
KORINTHE STARES
She floats before these two images, looking from one to the other. The road. 
The doors. The choice. The consequence.
"He... he turned back?"
Her voice is small now, stripped of the layered echo. Almost human.
"He was riding away. To Istar. I remember... he said he had a 
quest. A divine mission. Gladria's family said he was fleeing justice, 
but he said..."
She looks at the image of him on the road.
"He chose me. He turned back for me."
Then she looks at the image of him at the doors, wreathed in flames.
"And he couldn't reach us. The fire... it wasn't natural. It wouldn't 
yield to strength or will. It was divine judgment, and he was as 
helpless before it as we were."
Her form wavers, becoming less distinct.
"Three hundred years. Three hundred years I believed he let us die. 
That he stood outside by choice, listening to us scream because we 
no longer mattered to him."
"But he tried. He TRIED. And he failed because the gods 
themselves had judged, and no mortal - not even the finest knight - 
could stand against that."
She turns to look at all the images surrounding her: herself alive, Peradur 
laughing, the Cataclysm's victims, Soth's choice, Soth's failure.
"My death wasn't murder. It was... consequence. Soth failed the 
world to save me. And the world burned. And I burned with it. Not 
because he didn't love me, but because he loved me TOO MUCH."
The realization is breaking something in her - three centuries of rage built on a 
false foundation, crumbling.
"What have I... what have I BEEN for three hundred years?"
 
EIGHTH IMAGE - THE MIRROR
This is the moment Johannes planned for. The final piece.
JOHANNES - YOUR FINAL ILLUSION
Cast Minor Illusion one more time. Show her what she's become. 
Not as accusation, but as truth. The banshee - wreathed in ethereal 
fire, face twisted by rage and grief, hands like claws. Place it beside 
the image of her alive, so she can see both at once.
What do you say as you show her this final reflection?
Cyrus and Kessa are absolutely still, barely breathing. They're watching a 
three-hundred-year-old curse crack open before their eyes.
Finish it, Johannes. Show her the choice she has now.
I create two images - one of her before, then...what she is now.
Dec 10
EIGHTH IMAGE - NINTH IMAGE
Johannes casts Minor Illusion twice more, placing them directly in front of 
Korinthe, side by side, unavoidable:
Left image: Lady Korinthe as she was - the radiant elven woman from the 
portrait. Beautiful, warm, alive. The smile that welcomed guests. The hand 
over her heart. Grace and kindness made manifest.
Right image: Lady Korinthe as she is now - the banshee. Translucent, 
wreathed in cold ethereal flames. Face twisted by three centuries of rage and 
grief. Eyes burning with blue-white fire. Hands curled into claws. Hair floating 
in an unfelt wind. Beautiful still, but terrible. A victim transformed into 
something that perpetuates suffering.
The two images stand side by side. Past and present. Woman and wraith. 
What was and what is.
 
KORINTHE SEES HERSELF
She floats before the two images, staring. Her translucent hands rise slowly to 
her face, as if she could feel features she no longer possesses.
"Is that... is that what I've become?"
Her voice is barely a whisper now, all the multiple tones collapsing into a 
single, fragile sound.
She looks at the image of herself alive - the warmth, the welcome, the life. 
Then at the banshee - the rage, the cold, the death.
"I was... I was beautiful once. Not just in form, but in spirit. I 
welcomed travelers. I loved my son. I tended the gardens. I sang 
songs of joy, not lament."
She reaches toward the image of her living self, her hand passing through it.
"And now I am... this. Three hundred years of hate. Three hundred 
years of screaming at doors that will never open, at a man who 
cannot hear me, at gods who turned away."
"I have become what killed me. I have become fire and pain and 
death."
Her form flickers, unstable, as if the realization is undermining her very 
existence.
"Peradur would not know me. If my son could see what his mother 
became... he would be afraid. He would run from me."
The truth of that statement seems to physically wound her. She doubles over, 
her ethereal form curling in on itself.
"What have I done? How many have I killed? How many mothers, 
how many sons have I destroyed in my rage?"
She's weeping now - truly weeping, though no tears fall. The cold in the Chapel 
lessens slightly. The frost on the floor begins to melt at the edges.
"I blamed Soth. I blamed the gods. I blamed everyone but myself 
for choosing to remain here, choosing rage over rest, choosing to 
be THIS-" She gestures at the banshee image, "-instead of accepting 
what happened and... and letting go."
 
SHE TURNS TO THE THREE OF YOU
Her burning eyes focus on Johannes, then Cyrus, then back to Johannes.
"You came here... why? The Dragon Army soldiers came for power, 
for the Starjewel, for an alliance with the damned. But you..."
She looks at Cyrus's holy symbol of Mishakal, still glowing faintly.
"You came with truth. You showed me what I could not see for 
three hundred years. You gave me... perspective."
Her voice becomes urgent, almost pleading:
"The cleric spoke of the Disks. Of the gods returning. Is this true? 
Can the gods truly see us again? Can they... can they grant mercy 
even to ones such as I, who have spent centuries spreading the very 
pain I suffered?"
"Can this-" She gestures at herself, at the banshee she's become, "-be 
undone? Or am I damned to remain this monster forever, even now 
that I SEE what I've become?"
 
THE MOMENT OF CHOICE
The Chapel is silent except for the faint dripping of melting frost. The nine 
images surround Korinthe like a gallery of truth - her life, her son, the 
Cataclysm, Soth's choice, Soth's failure, and the mirror showing what she was 
versus what she is.
She's listening. She's present. The rage has given way to grief, and the grief 
has given way to... possibility.
CYRUS STEPS FORWARD
Brother Cyrus approaches slowly, respectfully, holding his holy symbol of 
Mishakal openly.
"Lady Korinthe, I am Brother Cyrus, servant of Mishakal, the Healing 
Goddess. And I tell you this truth: the Disks of Mishakal have returned to 
Krynn. The gods can hear prayers again. Three hundred years of silence has 
ended."
He stops ten feet from her, close enough to speak intimately but respecting her 
space.
"I cannot promise redemption. I cannot promise salvation. That judgment 
belongs to powers far beyond me. But I can promise this: your suffering has 
been witnessed. Your pain has been seen. And if there is mercy to be found, if 
there is healing even for wounds three centuries old... Mishakal offers it."
He looks at her directly, unafraid despite the supernatural terror she 
represents:
"The question is: what do you choose? You have agency, my lady. You always 
have. Will you remain trapped in the moment of your death, forever raging at 
what cannot be changed? Or will you accept what happened, release the rage, 
and allow yourself to... rest?"
 
KORINTHE LOOKS AT CYRUS
Then at Johannes. Then at Kessa, who has remained silent but supportive 
throughout.
"You three... you risked death to bring me this truth. You walked 
into a cursed keep, faced a death knight, and stood before a 
banshee to show me... what I had forgotten. Who I once was."
She looks at the image of Peradur, her son, frozen in laughter.
"If the gods can grant mercy... if there is rest to be found... then I 
choose..."
She pauses, the weight of three hundred years of habit warring with this new 
clarity.
"I choose to let go."
 
What happens next?
This is a pivotal moment. Korinthe has made her choice, but 
the mechanism of release is unclear.
Does she:
1.	Need the Disks physically present to break the curse?
2.	Need Cyrus to perform some ritual or prayer?
3.	Simply... fade, now that she's released the rage that sustained her?
4.	Need to confront Soth directly, to grant and receive forgiveness?
Johannes, Cyrus - what do you say or do in response to her choice? 
And how do you help her find the rest she seeks?
"My Lady, you have a choice. Even as you felt like it had been taken from you, 
others are also trapped. What is your choice? You can free yourself from your 
own pain, find absolution and freedom through the sacred rites Cyrus can 
offer. And none on this plane of existence could fault or even question your 
right to do so. You can be freed even as the words are uttered, free to rejoin 
your lost loves, your friends, your family, even your son."
"But, out of the love you once held for your son, there are others, bound out 
of consequence, loyalty, even love. The greatest revenge is to offer mercy, 
especially when there is no right to ask or expect it. To give what they cannot 
ask for, how is that not both freedom for you, and freedom for them? We do 
not ask this of you, but offer you the opportunity to choose for yourself. If you 
would, we can ask one, one worthy to bear the Disks of our goddess, who can 
stand in judgement, to ascertain, in your presence, the full truth of his actions, 
his thoughts, and his intents, but only if you are willing to forgo your own 
justice, to allow that truth to dictate his fate."
"What say you, my Lady?"

Dec 10
KORINTHE'S CONTEMPLATION
The banshee floats silently, suspended between past and present, between 
rage and mercy. The nine images surrounding her bear witness - her beauty, 
her son, the truth of the Cataclysm, the mirror of what she's become.
She looks at the image of Peradur - her laughing child, frozen in innocent joy.
"If I let go now... if I simply accept Cyrus's rites and pass beyond... I 
find peace. I find rest. I am reunited with my son, free from three 
hundred years of torment."
Her voice is steady, thoughtful. The desperate, layered echo is gone. She 
sounds almost... human again.
"But Soth remains. And Sir Caradoc. And the others - the knights 
who followed him, who stood by him, who share his curse not 
because they failed the world, but because they followed one who 
did."
She turns to look toward the Chapel doors, toward where the Great Hall lies 
beyond.
"They are trapped as I was trapped. Locked in their guilt, their 
failure, their endless punishment. And I..." She looks at her translucent 
hands, at the cold flames that wreathe her. "...I have been their 
tormentor, haven't I? Every night, singing my lament. Every day, 
radiating my rage. I have been part of their punishment for three 
hundred years."
She looks at Johannes, and there's something ancient and weary in her 
burning eyes, but also something awakening - purpose beyond pain.
"You offer me a choice. True choice, not the illusion of it. Rest for 
myself... or justice for others. Mercy I could take... or mercy I could 
give."
"You speak of bringing one who bears the Disks. One who can 
stand in judgment, who can see truth and pronounce it. Not me, 
with my three hundred years of hatred. Not Soth, drowning in his 
guilt. But an impartial witness to finally, FINALLY judge whether 
this curse has been punishment enough."
She floats closer to Johannes and Cyrus, her form becoming more distinct, 
more solid, as if making this choice is giving her substance.
"If I choose this... if I forgo my own rest to be present for his 
judgment... what happens? Do I remain as I am? Do I become 
something else? Do I risk being trapped here forever if the gods 
judge him unworthy of release?"
Her voice isn't fearful, just... careful. She's thinking like the woman she was - 
the lady of a keep who made decisions that affected more than just herself.
"And Soth... you would bring the Disks to him? You would allow 
him to stand before divine judgment after what he's done? After 
the world he failed to save?"
She pauses, then more quietly:
"After the love he bore me, misguided and destructive as it was, 
that led to all of this?"
 
CYRUS SPEAKS
"My lady, if you choose to wait, to be present for his judgment, I believe 
Mishakal would sustain you. Not as this-" he gestures at her banshee form, 
"-but as something more peaceful. A witness rather than a tormentor. Your 
rage has already begun to fade. Your clarity has returned. That transformation 
would continue."
"As for risk... yes, there is risk. If Soth is judged and found still unworthy, if 
the curse continues, you might remain. But..." He looks at her seriously. "You 
would remain by choice, not compulsion. And choice transforms suffering into 
purpose. You would not be trapped - you would be bearing witness."
"And if he is judged worthy of release, if the curse is lifted... then you both find 
rest together. The curse that bound you would release you simultaneously."
 
KESSA ADDS QUIETLY
"Three hundred years you've blamed him. Hated him. Raged at him. If you 
leave now without seeing the truth pronounced, without witnessing his 
judgment... part of you might always wonder. Was your rage justified? Was 
the curse fair? Did he deserve what he got?"
"But if you're there when the Disks reveal the full truth - his sins, his 
intentions, his three hundred years of penance - then you'll know. And 
knowledge brings closure in ways that assumption never can."
 
KORINTHE LOOKS AT THE IMAGE OF HERSELF - THE LIVING 
WOMAN
"She would choose mercy. The woman I was - the one who 
welcomed guests, who tended gardens, who loved deeply - she 
would not take her own peace while leaving others in torment."
"But she was also foolish. Naive. She believed in a murderer, 
trusted when she should have questioned, and died for it."
Then she looks at the banshee image.
"And this creature would choose vengeance. Would take her rest 
and let Soth rot forever in his guilt. Would say 'he deserves every 
moment of suffering.'"
"But she... I... have spent three hundred years being that creature. 
And what has it brought me? What has vengeance given me except 
more pain?"
She looks directly at Johannes, and when she speaks, her voice is clear and 
decided:
"I choose to wait. I choose to be present for his judgment. Bring the 
Disks. Bring your bearer who can see truth. Let Soth stand before 
divine judgment with me as witness."
"Not because I forgive him - I am not sure I can, not yet. But 
because after three hundred years of rage, I want to know 
the truth. The full truth. Not the fragments I died believing, not the 
assumptions that sustained my hatred, but the complete, 
undeniable, divine truth of what he did, why he did it, and whether 
his penance has been sufficient."
"And if the gods judge him worthy of release... then I will accept 
that judgment. And if they judge him still wanting... then at least he 
will have had a fair trial, not just an eternity of self-inflicted 
torment."
She turns to Cyrus:
"Can you... help me? Transform me from this-" she gestures at 
herself, "-into something that can wait with dignity rather than 
rage? I do not wish to be a banshee for however long this takes. I 
wish to be... myself again. As much as is possible."
 
THE STARJEWEL
As if responding to her choice, the corrupted gem on the altar flickers. The 
sickly green-black light pulses once, twice, then begins to fade. Not 
extinguishing, but... cleansing. Slowly, over the course of several seconds, the 
corruption drains away, and the gem begins to glow with pure, clear light - 
silver-white, holy.
The Starjewel is restoring itself.
JOHANNES, CYRUS - How do you respond to her choice? And 
Cyrus, can you perform a ritual or prayer to help transform her 
from vengeful banshee to peaceful witness?
And what is your plan for bringing the Disks to Dargaard Keep for 
Soth's judgment?
I leave Cyrus to deal with this. I pull out the Sending Stone and send word to 
Laurana to send for Goldmoon and the Disks to be brought with all haste to 
Dargaard Keep. All will be explained, but it is critical that they both arrive as 
soon as possible.
Dec 10
JOHANNES USES THE SENDING STONE
While Cyrus begins ministering to Lady Korinthe, Johannes steps back toward 
the Chapel entrance, pulling the Sending Stone from his pouch. He activates it, 
feeling the familiar warmth as the connection establishes.
Johannes's message to Commander Laurana (25 words):
"Dargaard Keep secure. Send Goldmoon with Disks immediately. Divine 
judgment required. Death knight seeks redemption. Curse may end. Come 
with all haste. Will explain upon arrival."
There's a pause - perhaps ten seconds - then Laurana's voice comes through, 
tense and surprised:
"Goldmoon with Disks? Johannes, are you- Never mind. I trust you. She's in 
Haven. I'll dispatch immediately. Expect arrival in four days. Stay alive."
The connection closes.
Four days. Goldmoon is at Haven, roughly 80 miles away. With urgent 
travel, magical assistance if needed, and the importance of the mission... four 
days is optimistic but achievable.
 
MEANWHILE - CYRUS AND LADY KORINTHE
Brother Cyrus approaches the altar carefully, his holy symbol of Mishakal 
glowing softly in his hand. Lady Korinthe floats before him, her banshee form 
flickering between rage and peace, between monster and woman.
"My lady, what you're asking... I've never attempted anything like this. 
Transforming an undead creature while keeping them extant, changing their 
nature without destroying them..." He pauses, thinking. "But Mishakal is the 
goddess of healing, and healing isn't always about flesh. Sometimes it's about 
spirit."
He closes his eyes, praying silently, then speaks:
"Lady Korinthe, I cannot make you mortal again. I cannot give you 
life. But perhaps... perhaps I can ease the curse. Transform you 
from a creature of rage and death into something more... benign. A 
spirit at rest, waiting for judgment rather than raging against it."
CYRUS'S RITUAL (Improvised, using Channel Divinity creatively):
Cyrus places his holy symbol on the altar beside the now-cleansing Starjewel. 
He begins to pray - not a memorized liturgy, but spontaneous supplication:
"Mishakal, Healing Goddess, Light-Bringer, Merciful Mother - hear your 
servant. Before you is one who has suffered beyond measure, who has raged 
beyond reason, and who now seeks peace without yet seeking rest. She asks 
not for redemption, but for clarity. Not for forgiveness, but for truth. Grant 
her the grace to wait with dignity for divine judgment."
He extends his hands toward Korinthe:
"Transform rage into patience. Transform vengeance into witness. Let her 
pain subside without her existence ending. Let her remain, not as tormentor, 
but as testament to suffering acknowledged and justice pursued."
DIVINE RESPONSE:
The Chapel fills with warm golden light - not the cold blue-white of undeath or 
the sickly green of corruption, but genuine divine radiance. It flows from 
Cyrus's holy symbol, washing over Lady Korinthe like gentle rain.
She gasps - an unnecessary breath, but the memory of breathing, the habit of 
being alive.
THE TRANSFORMATION:
Her banshee form begins to change:
*	The cold flames wreathing her body fade, replaced by a soft silver glow
*	Her twisted, rage-filled expression softens, returning to the beauty of 
the portrait
*	Her clawed hands relax, becoming graceful once more
*	Her tattered, burned gown repairs itself, returning to the elegant blue 
she wore in life
*	The burning fury in her eyes dims to something gentler - still ethereal, 
still glowing, but without the rage
*	She becomes more present, more solid, though still clearly a spirit 
rather than flesh
She's no longer a banshee. She's... something else. A ghost, perhaps, but 
peaceful. A spirit at rest, awaiting judgment rather than perpetuating torment.
KORINTHE LOOKS AT HER HANDS:
"I can... I can feel again. Not physically, but... emotionally. The rage 
is gone. The need to destroy, to hurt, to make others feel what I felt 
- it's gone."
She looks at Cyrus with wonder and gratitude:
"You've given me back myself. Not life, but... self. I am Lady 
Korinthe again, not just the screaming thing that died in the 
flames."
She floats down until she's standing on the Chapel floor - or appearing to 
stand, her feet hovering just an inch above the stone.
"Thank you, priest of Mishakal. You have shown me more mercy 
than I have shown anyone in three hundred years."
 
KESSA'S OBSERVATION:
"The temperature's rising. The Chapel doesn't feel cursed anymore - it feels... 
sacred again. Like whatever corruption held this place is lifting."
She's right. The oppressive cold is fading. The frost has melted completely. 
The scorch marks on the walls seem less stark, less accusatory.
 
LADY KORINTHE TURNS TO JOHANNES:
"Four days until judgment arrives. Four days for Soth to prepare. 
Four days for me to... decide what I truly want from this."
She looks toward the Chapel doors, toward where the Great Hall and Lord 
Soth lie beyond.
"I should speak with him. After three hundred years of screaming 
accusations through these walls, I should... speak. With clarity. 
With the truth you've shown me."
She looks uncertain - the first time she's shown true vulnerability rather than 
rage or grief.
"Will you accompany me? All three of you? I do not think I can face 
him alone. Not yet. Not after everything."
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
Lady Korinthe - peaceful now, transformed, but still bearing three centuries of 
complex emotions - wants to confront Lord Soth before Goldmoon arrives 
with the Disks.
Do you:
1.	Accompany her immediately - facilitate the conversation between 
Soth and Korinthe now
2.	Suggest waiting - let her process this transformation first, speak to 
him closer to judgment day
3.	Prepare differently - discuss what should be said, how to approach 
this reunion
4.	Handle the Starjewel first - the now-purified gem is sitting on the 
altar, and it was what the Dragon Army sought
What's your approach?
My Lady, we will gladly assist you. But, would you first permit us one small 
favor? Even as your pain has transformed you, his guilt and pain has 
transformed your husband. May we have your leave to first show him the 
Starjewel as Testament of our words regarding what has happened here? That 
he might be prepared when you do come before him, and that he might know 
what comes with Goldmoon?
Dec 10
LADY KORINTHE'S RESPONSE
She considers Johannes's request, looking back at the altar where the 
Starjewel now rests - no longer corrupted with sickly green-black light, but 
glowing with pure silver-white radiance. The symbol of Soth's former honor, 
now restored.
"The Starjewel..." Her voice is soft, contemplative. "Three hundred 
years it has sat there, corrupted, a reminder of everything that was 
lost. And now, because I chose truth over vengeance, it cleanses 
itself."
She floats closer to the altar, studying the gem.
"You would show it to him first? Prepare him for... for seeing me as 
I am now, rather than as I have been?"
She's quiet for a moment, then nods slowly.
"Yes. That is... wise. And kind."
She looks at Johannes with genuine respect. "If you walk into that hall 
with me at your side, after three hundred years of my lament 
echoing through his existence, he will not be prepared. He will 
expect rage, accusation, perhaps another three centuries of 
torment."
"But if you show him the Starjewel first - proof that something has 
changed, that redemption is possible, that the curse is shifting - 
then when I appear, he might be able to hear me rather than simply 
brace for punishment."
She touches the Starjewel gently - her spectral hand doesn't pass through it, 
but rests upon it as if she were still flesh.
"This was his greatest treasure. The symbol of his worthiness as a 
Knight of the Rose, given to him by Paladine's blessing. When it 
corrupted with the curse, it broke something in him beyond the 
obvious."
"If you show him it's pure again... you show him that 
perhaps he can be pure again. That three hundred years of penance 
might actually mean something."
She carefully lifts the Starjewel from the altar - her transformed state allowing 
her to interact with physical objects - and offers it to Johannes.
"Take it to him. Show him what his wife's choice to forgive, to seek 
truth rather than vengeance, has accomplished. Let him see that 
mercy can cleanse what guilt could not."
"And tell him..." She pauses, choosing her words carefully. "Tell him that 
I am coming. Not to torment. Not to rage. But to witness. To hear 
truth. To be present when the gods finally judge whether we have 
suffered enough."
"Tell him that Lady Korinthe - his Korinthe, not the screaming 
thing in the Chapel - wishes to speak with him. If he will have me."
Her voice wavers slightly on those last words - a vulnerability that shows how 
much courage this is taking.
"I will wait here. In this Chapel where I died, now made sacred 
again. And when you return with his answer... we will face three 
hundred years of pain together, and see if understanding can heal 
what time could not."
 
THE STARJEWEL
Johannes now holds the Starjewel - a fist-sized gem in an elegant silver 
setting. It's warm to the touch, pulsing with holy light. This is a relic of 
Paladine, given to knights who exemplify honor, courage, and wisdom.
Cyrus examines it (Religion check: 19):
"This is... Johannes, this is a major holy relic. In its corrupted state, the 
Dragon Army wanted to use it as leverage, as proof they could restore Soth's 
honor. But now, purified? This proves divine grace is possible even for the 
fallen. This is evidence that redemption isn't just theological theory - it's real, 
tangible, achievable."
Kessa: "So we walk into the Great Hall, show a death knight that his most 
treasured possession - corrupted for three hundred years - is suddenly pure 
again, and tell him his dead wife wants to talk. No pressure."
She manages a slight smile despite the gravity. "Let's do this before I overthink 
it."
 
RETURNING TO THE GREAT HALL
The three of you leave the Chapel, the Starjewel's holy light illuminating the 
corridor. The Gallery of Ancestors seems different now - less oppressive, less 
haunted. The portraits of the family watch you pass with what might be 
approval.
As you enter the Great Hall, Lord Soth remains on his throne exactly as you 
left him. The skeletal warriors stand motionless. The ghostly figures hover 
near the ceiling.
But as you approach, carrying the Starjewel, Soth's head turns slowly. The 
burning points of light in his eye sockets focus on the gem in Johannes's 
hands.
He rises from his throne.
The movement is sudden, almost violent. The greatsword clatters to the stone 
floor - the first time in three hundred years he's dropped it.
"That light... that is..."
His voice - usually hollow and grinding - cracks with something that might be 
hope or might be anguish.
"The Starjewel. But it cannot be. It has been corrupted since the 
curse fell. It has been green-black poison for three centuries, a 
reminder of everything I destroyed."
He descends the steps, moving toward you with purpose but not aggression. 
The cold flames around his armor flare and dim erratically, as if his emotional 
state is disrupting the curse's manifestation.
He stops twenty feet away, staring at the gem.
"How? How is it pure? What have you done?"
 
JOHANNES - THE FLOOR IS YOURS
You hold the Starjewel, proof of transformation. You carry Lady Korinthe's 
message. You have four days until Goldmoon arrives with the Disks for 
judgment.
What do you tell Lord Soth? How do you explain what happened in 
the Chapel, and how do you deliver Korinthe's message?
Everything. In order
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S ACCOUNT
Johannes stands before Lord Soth, the purified Starjewel glowing in his hands, 
and speaks with the same honest clarity he used with Sir Caradoc, with Soth 
himself, and with Lady Korinthe.
"My lord, we entered the Chapel as you permitted. We found Lady Korinthe 
there, as you warned - a banshee, consumed by three centuries of rage and 
grief."
He pauses, letting that truth settle.
"She attacked us with words, with fury. She believed you had murdered 
Gladria. She believed you had let her and Peradur burn through choice rather 
than helplessness. She was trapped in the moment of her death, reliving it 
eternally, unable to see beyond that single terrible truth."
Soth remains motionless, the blue-white points of light in his eye sockets fixed 
on Johannes.
"So I showed her truth. Not my truth, not your truth, but the truth. Using 
illusions, I surrounded her with images - what she was in life, beautiful and 
kind. Her son Peradur, laughing and innocent. The Cataclysm itself, showing 
her she was not alone in suffering, that millions died in that divine judgment."
Johannes's voice remains steady, matter-of-fact, delivering the narrative as it 
happened.
"I showed her you on the road to Istar. Turning back. Choosing her over the 
world. I showed her you at the Chapel doors, wreathed in flames, trying 
desperately to break through and failing. Not because you didn't love her, but 
because even the finest knight cannot stand against the gods' judgment."
"I showed her what she became - the banshee beside the woman she was. Past 
and present. Grace and rage. I gave her perspective beyond the single moment 
that had trapped her for three centuries."
He looks directly at Soth.
"And she understood. She saw the truth. That her death was not murder but 
consequence. That you failed the world to save her, and the world burned, and 
she burned with it. Not because you didn't care, but because you cared too 
much. You chose love over duty, and divine judgment answered."
 
SOTH'S REACTION
The death knight's form trembles. The cold flames around his armor dim 
almost to nothing.
"She... she saw? She understood?"
His voice is barely audible, stripped of the grinding echo.
"Three hundred years I have listened to her lament. Three hundred 
years of accusation, of her voice singing my failures. And you 
showed her... truth?"
 
JOHANNES CONTINUES
"More than that, my lord. I gave her a choice."
He holds up the Starjewel so its light fills the space between them.
"I told her she could accept Brother Cyrus's rites, find peace, pass beyond to be 
reunited with her son. She had earned that rest. No one would question her 
right to it."
"But I also told her that others remain trapped here. You. Sir Caradoc. The 
knights who followed you. Bound by consequence, loyalty, and love. I offered 
her the opportunity to wait, to be present when divine judgment finally 
comes."
"I told her we would bring the Disks of Mishakal here. That Goldmoon, who 
bears them, would stand witness. That after three hundred years, you could 
face judgment from the gods themselves - not self-inflicted torment, but actual 
divine assessment of whether your penance has been sufficient."
Soth takes one step forward, then stops, as if afraid to hope.
"The Disks... here? Judgment? After three centuries of silence, the 
gods would finally... speak?"
 
JOHANNES DELIVERS THE MESSAGE
"Lady Korinthe chose to wait. She chose to forgo her own rest to witness your 
judgment. Not because she forgives you - she's not certain she can, not yet. But 
because she wants to know the complete truth. She wants the gods to 
pronounce it, not her assumptions or your guilt."
He gestures to the Starjewel.
"And when she made that choice - when she chose mercy and truth over 
vengeance and rest - this happened. The Starjewel purified itself. Three 
hundred years of corruption cleansed in a moment because she chose to see 
you not as the monster she died believing you were, but as the man who failed 
catastrophically while trying to save her."
Johannes's voice becomes gentler, more personal.
"Brother Cyrus performed a ritual. He transformed her from the banshee 
you've heard screaming for three centuries into... herself again. Lady Korinthe. 
Peaceful. Whole in spirit if not in flesh. Still a spirit, still undead, but no longer 
consumed by rage."
He delivers her message directly:
"She is coming. Not to torment. Not to rage. But to witness. To hear truth. To 
be present when the gods finally judge whether you have suffered enough."
A pause.
"She asks if you will have her. If you will speak with her - not as death knight 
to banshee, but as Soth to Korinthe. As the man and woman you were before 
the Cataclysm, trying to understand what you've become and whether 
redemption is possible."
 
THE STARJEWEL'S MEANING
Johannes holds the gem forward, offering it.
"This is proof, my lord. Proof that divine grace can cleanse what guilt cannot. 
Proof that three hundred years of penance might actually mean something. 
Proof that when someone chooses mercy over vengeance, the curse itself 
responds."
"Lady Korinthe transformed this through her choice. She gave you back your 
honor - symbolically, at least. The Starjewel is pure again because she chose to 
see you clearly rather than through the lens of rage."
"In four days, Goldmoon arrives with the Disks of Mishakal. In four days, you 
stand before divine judgment. And Lady Korinthe will be there, bearing 
witness, seeking truth alongside you."
Johannes lowers the Starjewel slightly, his voice becoming a question:
"Will you speak with her? Will you face three hundred years of pain together 
and see if understanding can heal what time could not?"
 
LORD SOTH'S RESPONSE
The death knight stands absolutely still for a long moment. Then, slowly, he 
sinks to one knee - not in submission, but in something like prayer, or perhaps 
simply the weight of centuries of guilt finally being acknowledged.
"She chose to wait. For me. For judgment. For truth."
His gauntleted hands come up to cover his face - a gesture of overwhelming 
emotion from something that technically has no face to cover.
"Three hundred years I have sat in this hall, believing she died 
hating me. Believing her rage was eternal and justified. Believing I 
deserved every moment of her lament, every accusation sung 
through these walls."
"And you tell me she chose to remain? Not as punishment, but as 
witness? Not to torment me, but to stand beside me when the gods 
finally judge?"
He looks up at Johannes, at the Starjewel.
"I will speak with her. Gods help me, I will speak with her. I do not 
know what to say after three hundred years of silence between us, 
after three hundred years of her screaming and my guilt. But if she 
has the courage to face me, then I must have the courage to face 
her."
He rises slowly, and for the first time since you entered Dargaard Keep, he 
sounds almost... human.
"Bring her to me. Let us speak truth before the gods arrive to judge 
us. Let us see if two people who loved catastrophically, who failed 
utterly, who have suffered eternally... can find some measure of 
understanding."
He looks at the skeletal warriors along the walls, then at the ghostly figures 
near the ceiling.
"And when Goldmoon arrives with the Disks... when judgment 
comes... let it fall upon me fairly. I have carried my guilt for three 
centuries. If the gods deem it sufficient, let me rest. If they deem it 
insufficient..."
A pause.
"Then at least I will have stood before them honestly, with 
Korinthe as witness, and known that my penance was measured by 
something greater than my own endless self-flagellation."
 
CYRUS SPEAKS
"My lord, before Lady Korinthe comes before you, I should prepare you. She 
is... changed. Peaceful. She looks as she did in life - beautiful, graceful, whole 
in spirit. But she is still a spirit, still bearing the weight of what happened. This 
conversation will not be easy for either of you."
"But it is necessary. For both of you. And perhaps... perhaps it's 
the beginning of healing that three centuries couldn't bring."
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
Lord Soth has agreed. He will speak with Lady Korinthe. He will face 
judgment when Goldmoon arrives.
Do you:
1.	Return to the Chapel immediately - bring Korinthe to the Great 
Hall now
2.	Give Soth time to prepare - let him process this revelation first
3.	Establish ground rules - discuss how this conversation should 
proceed
4.	Do something with the Starjewel - return it to Soth now, or wait 
until after they speak?
What's your approach?
4 leave the jewel, and let Soth prepare as we return to korinthe
Dec 10
JOHANNES PLACES THE STARJEWEL
Johannes approaches Lord Soth and extends the Starjewel toward him - not 
throwing it, not placing it carelessly, but offering it with the respect due a 
sacred relic.
"This is yours, my lord. It always has been. A symbol of your honor, given by 
Paladine when you achieved Knight of the Rose. It corrupted with your fall, 
and now it's pure again because of your wife's choice to seek truth over 
vengeance."
He places the gem in Soth's gauntleted hand.
"Hold it. Remember who you were. Prepare yourself for who you might speak 
with - not the screaming banshee you've heard for three centuries, but Lady 
Korinthe as she was. As she's chosen to be again."
 
SOTH HOLDS THE STARJEWEL
The death knight's fingers close around the gem, and for a moment, the cold 
flames wreathing his armor flicker wildly. The pure light of the Starjewel 
seems to war with the curse's darkness, neither winning but both coexisting.
"I had forgotten how it felt. Warm. Alive. Holy."
He clutches it to his chest, where his heart once beat.
"I will... I need time. To find words. To remember how to speak to 
her as a husband rather than as a cursed thing addressing its 
tormentor. Go. Bring her when she is ready. I will be here."
He returns to his throne slowly, the Starjewel still held against his chest. The 
skeletal warriors remain motionless, but somehow their presence feels less 
threatening - more like honor guards waiting for something significant rather 
than eternal punishment.
 
RETURN TO THE CHAPEL
The three of you leave the Great Hall and make your way back through the 
Gallery of Ancestors. The portraits of the family seem to watch with 
anticipation rather than judgment.
When you enter the Chapel, Lady Korinthe turns from where she's been 
standing - or appearing to stand - near the altar. Her transformed appearance 
still takes a moment to process: the peaceful, graceful spirit rather than the 
rage-filled banshee.
"You spoke with him?"
Her voice carries anxiety, hope, and three centuries of complicated emotion.
"Does he... will he see me? Or does he prefer I remain here, out of 
sight, until the judgment arrives?"
She's wringing her hands - a nervous gesture that's heartbreakingly human.
 
CYRUS SPEAKS GENTLY
"He will see you, my lady. He wants to see you. We gave him the Starjewel, 
showed him it's pure again because of your choice. And he... he broke, in a 
way. The guilt, the hope, the possibility that three centuries of suffering might 
actually mean something - it overwhelmed him."
"He's preparing himself now. Trying to find words for a conversation he never 
thought possible."
 
KESSA ADDS
"He's terrified. We could see it even through the curse, even through the 
undeath. He's afraid of what you'll say, what you'll ask, what three hundred 
years of truth will sound like when spoken aloud rather than screamed 
through walls."
She looks at Korinthe with surprising compassion. "You're both scared. 
That's... actually good. Fear means this matters. Fear means you're both 
present, both invested in what happens next."
 
LADY KORINTHE TAKES A BREATH (unnecessary but habitual)
"Three hundred years. Three hundred years we have been 
separated by rage and guilt, by my accusations and his self-
punishment. And now..."
She looks down at her hands - spectral but solid, graceful rather than clawed.
"Now I must walk into that hall and speak with the man I died 
believing was a murderer. The man I now know was a catastrophic 
failure, but not a villain. The man who loved me enough to doom 
the world."
"I don't know if I can forgive him. I don't know if forgiveness is 
even what this is about. But I can face him. I can hear him. I can 
stand beside him when judgment comes."
She looks at the three of you.
"Will you... will you stay? In the hall, when we speak? Not to 
mediate or intervene, but simply to... bear witness? If three 
centuries of pain spill out between us, I would have impartial 
witnesses present. And if understanding emerges... I would have it 
recorded by those who brought truth to us both."
"I do not wish to do this alone. And I do not think Soth should 
either."
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
Lady Korinthe is ready to face Lord Soth. She asks that you remain in the 
Great Hall as witnesses to their conversation - not participants, but present.
This is a pivotal moment: three hundred years of curse, guilt, grief, and rage 
coming to a head before divine judgment arrives in four days.
Do you:
1.	Agree to witness - remain in the hall as she speaks with Soth
2.	Give them privacy - this conversation might be too personal for 
observers
3.	Set boundaries - agree to witness but establish that you'll intervene if 
needed
4.	Prepare her further - discuss what she might say or ask before 
entering
What's your choice?
1
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S RESPONSE
"We'll be there, my lady. As witnesses. This moment - after three hundred 
years - deserves to be seen, to be remembered. Not for gossip or judgment, but 
because truth witnessed has power that private pain does not."
CYRUS NODS
"We brought you both to this point. It would be wrong to leave you now. We'll 
remain present but silent unless you need us."
KESSA
"Besides, someone needs to make sure this conversation actually happens 
instead of three more centuries of avoiding it. We've come too far to back out 
now."
 
LADY KORINTHE'S GRATITUDE
"Thank you. All three of you. You have done more for us in hours 
than three centuries of isolation accomplished. You brought truth 
where there was only assumption. You brought mercy where there 
was only rage."
She smooths her spectral gown - a nervous gesture, preparing herself.
"Very well. Let us... let us face what we have avoided for so long."
 
PROCESSION TO THE GREAT HALL
The four of you leave the Chapel together:
*	Lady Korinthe leads, floating gracefully but with visible tension
*	Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa follow several paces behind, a supportive 
presence
Through the Gallery of Ancestors, past the family portraits that seem to 
witness this moment. Down the grand corridor toward the Great Hall.
As you approach the massive doors, now fully open, Lady Korinthe pauses. 
Her spectral form flickers slightly - nervousness made manifest.
"Three hundred years. And now... moments away."
She steels herself, then continues forward.
 
ENTERING THE GREAT HALL
Lord Soth sits on his throne, the Starjewel clutched in his gauntleted hands, 
held against his chest. The cold flames around his armor are dim, subdued. 
The skeletal warriors stand at perfect attention along the walls. The ghostly 
figures hover near the ceiling, watching.
As Lady Korinthe enters, floating into the hall with Johannes, Cyrus, and 
Kessa behind her, Lord Soth rises.
The movement is careful, almost reverent. He descends the steps from the 
throne platform, the Starjewel still held against his heart.
They stand forty feet apart - death knight and transformed spirit, husband and 
wife, two souls who have been separated by more than death for three 
centuries.
LADY KORINTHE SPEAKS FIRST
Her voice is steady but carries the weight of centuries:
"Soth."
Not "Lord Soth." Not "my lord." Not "husband." Just his name, stripped of 
title and relationship, as if starting from the beginning.
LORD SOTH'S RESPONSE
"Korinthe."
His voice - normally hollow and grinding - is barely a whisper. The burning 
points of light in his eye sockets are fixed on her, unblinking, as if afraid she'll 
disappear if he looks away.
"You are... you look as you did. As I remember you. Before the 
flames. Before..."
He trails off, unable to finish.
 
THE SILENCE STRETCHES
Three hundred years of things unsaid, accusations unspoken (or screamed 
without response), grief unexpressed - it all hangs in the air between them.
Finally, Lady Korinthe floats forward ten feet. Stops. Continues.
She stops twenty feet from him. Close enough to speak without raising her 
voice. Far enough to maintain distance.
LADY KORINTHE CONTINUES
"For three hundred years, I believed you murdered Gladria. That 
you killed your first wife to have me. That you were corrupt, fallen, 
a betrayer of every vow you swore."
Soth doesn't defend himself. Doesn't interrupt. Just listens.
"I believed that when the Cataclysm came, you stood outside the 
Chapel and LET us burn. That you heard Peradur crying for you 
and CHOSE not to save him. That our deaths meant nothing to you 
compared to your own guilt."
"I have screamed these accusations through these walls for three 
centuries. I have sung your failures, your betrayals, your murders. 
I have made this place a monument to your damnation and my 
rage."
She pauses, and her voice becomes quieter:
"And I was wrong."
 
LORD SOTH REACTS
The death knight's form shudders. The cold flames around his armor flare 
briefly, then dim almost to nothing.
"You were not wrong. I AM fallen. I DID betray my vows. I DID 
fail-"
KORINTHE INTERRUPTS
"You did not murder Gladria. She died - perhaps by her own hand, 
perhaps by grief, perhaps by fate. But not by your sword. Not by 
your design."
"You did not CHOOSE to let us burn. You tried. Gods help you, you 
TRIED. The flames were divine judgment, and no mortal strength 
could overcome them. You failed, but not for lack of trying. Not for 
lack of love."
"And our deaths... they meant EVERYTHING to you. So much that 
three hundred years later, you still sit on this throne, reliving your 
failure, punishing yourself more thoroughly than any god could 
devise."
She floats closer - fifteen feet now.
"These truths were shown to me. By these three-" she gestures to 
Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa, "-who risked their lives to bring clarity to 
both of us."
 
LORD SOTH'S CONFESSION
"I chose you over the world."
His voice is raw, honest, stripped of three centuries of practiced guilt.
"The gods sent me a vision. Told me to ride to Istar, to stop the 
Kingpriest, to prevent the Cataclysm. I could have saved millions. I 
could have prevented the destruction of everything we knew."
"But Gladria's family accused me. They poisoned you against me 
with their words - or perhaps with truth I refused to see. And when 
I rode out, when I was on that road to Istar, I thought only of YOU. 
Of proving myself to YOU. Of returning to YOU."
"So I turned back. I abandoned my divine mission. I chose personal 
love over cosmic duty."
"And the Cataclysm struck. Millions died. The world broke. And 
when I returned here, you were burning. Peradur was screaming. 
And I could do NOTHING."
He clutches the Starjewel tighter.
"That is my sin. Not murder. Not cruelty. But loving you MORE 
than I loved the world. Choosing one woman over millions of lives. 
Being willing to let civilization burn if it meant I could prove myself 
worthy of your love."
"And you died anyway. Believing I was a murderer. Believing I 
didn't love you. When the truth was I loved you SO MUCH that I 
damned the entire world for you."
 
LADY KORINTHE'S RESPONSE
She's silent for a long moment, processing this. Then:
"That is... that is the most selfish, catastrophic, TERRIBLE 
declaration of love I have ever heard."
A pause.
"And it explains everything. Why the curse. Why three hundred 
years of torment. Why the gods judged you so harshly."
"Because you didn't fail out of weakness or evil. You failed out of 
LOVE. Misguided, selfish, world-destroying love. And that is 
somehow worse, because it means you were capable of great good 
but CHOSE personal devotion over universal salvation."
She floats closer - ten feet now.
"I don't know if I can forgive you for that. For loving me so much 
that millions died. For making my love the cause of such suffering."
"But I can understand it. And I can stand beside you when the gods 
judge whether three hundred years of guilt has been sufficient 
penance for choosing love over duty."
 
THE STARJEWEL PULSES
As if responding to this moment of truth, the Starjewel in Soth's hands flares 
with brilliant light - not blinding, but warm, present, undeniable. The pure 
radiance fills the hall, touching every corner, illuminating the skeletal 
warriors, the ghostly figures, Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa.
For just a moment, the curse seems to lift. The cold flames around Soth's 
armor vanish completely. Korinthe's spectral form becomes more solid, 
more real.
They stand there - death knight and spirit, husband and wife - seeing each 
other clearly for the first time in three hundred years.
Then the moment passes. The curse reasserts itself. But something has 
fundamentally changed.
 
LORD SOTH SPEAKS
"When Goldmoon arrives with the Disks... when the gods judge 
me... will you speak for me or against me?"
It's not a plea. Just a question. He genuinely doesn't know and genuinely 
wants to hear her answer.
 
LADY KORINTHE'S ANSWER
"I will speak truth. That you loved catastrophically. That you failed 
cosmically. That you have punished yourself eternally."
"And I will ask the gods this: Is three hundred years of torment 
sufficient? Has the man who chose love over duty learned what 
duty means? Has the knight who failed the world earned rest, or 
must he suffer longer?"
"I do not know their answer. But I will be there when they speak it. 
And whatever they decide... I will accept it."
She extends her hand toward him - not to touch, the distance is still too far, 
but as a gesture of... not forgiveness, but acknowledgment.
"We failed together, Soth. You failed the world to save me. I failed 
to see truth through my rage. We have both paid in centuries of 
suffering."
"In four days, that payment is assessed. And for the first time since 
the Cataclysm, we face it together rather than separated by walls 
and assumptions."
 
THE HALL IS SILENT
Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa have witnessed this - three hundred years of curse 
and guilt confronted, not resolved but acknowledged. Truth spoken. 
Understanding reached.
It's not redemption. It's not forgiveness. But it's a beginning.
LORD SOTH RETURNS TO HIS THRONE
He sits slowly, the Starjewel still clutched against his chest. He looks less like a 
cursed monster and more like a man awaiting judgment - afraid, hopeful, 
resigned.
LADY KORINTHE REMAINS IN THE HALL
She doesn't return to the Chapel. She floats to a position near the throne - not 
beside it, but present. Waiting together.
 
FOUR DAYS UNTIL GOLDMOON ARRIVES
The curse remains. The keep remains haunted. But something essential has 
shifted. Truth has been spoken. Understanding has been reached. Two souls 
who have suffered in isolation now suffer in company, awaiting divine 
judgment.
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
You have accomplished something extraordinary. What do you do during 
these four days while waiting for Goldmoon and the Disks to arrive?
Options:
1.	Remain at Dargaard Keep - continue supporting Soth and Korinthe, 
perhaps speak with other cursed spirits like Sir Caradoc
2.	Return to Dargaard Village - update the villagers, rest in relative 
safety
3.	Scout the region - ensure the route for Goldmoon's arrival is clear
4.	Prepare for the judgment ritual - discuss with Cyrus and Soth what 
this divine judgment might entail
What's your plan?
Skip to arrival
Dec 10
FOUR DAYS LATER - GOLDMOON'S ARRIVAL
The party has spent the intervening days at Dargaard Keep, bearing witness to 
the slow transformation of the cursed fortress. Lord Soth and Lady Korinthe 
have spoken at length - not constant conversation, but careful exchanges of 
truth, memory, and three centuries of unspoken grief. Sir Caradoc and the 
other bound spirits have felt the shift, their eternal vigils becoming something 
closer to hopeful waiting than mindless punishment.
Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa have alternated between the keep and Dargaard 
Village, assuring the fearful residents that something momentous is 
happening, that the screaming has stopped, that perhaps the curse is finally 
approaching its end.
 
DAY FOUR - MIDDAY
You're standing with Lord Soth and Lady Korinthe in the Great Hall when 
Cyrus's head snaps up.
"They're here. I can feel it - Mishakal's presence. The Disks are close."
Through the partially open main gates, you can see movement on the southern 
approach road. A small group, perhaps eight people, making their way up the 
mountain path.
LORD SOTH RISES FROM HIS THRONE
"After three hundred years... judgment arrives."
His voice carries fear, hope, and resignation in equal measure. The Starjewel 
gleams against his blackened armor.
LADY KORINTHE FLOATS BESIDE HIM
Not touching, but present. United in awaiting what comes.
 
THE DELEGATION ENTERS
Through the gates, across the courtyard, into the Great Hall come:
Goldmoon - A Plainswoman in her mid-thirties, tall and regal, with silver-
gold hair despite her youth. She carries a leather satchel, and even from across 
the hall, you can feel the divine presence emanating from it. The Disks of 
Mishakal.
Commander Laurana - Elven woman, tactical and composed, but clearly 
awed by what she's witnessing. She's brought four resistance soldiers as 
escort, but they remain near the entrance, clearly uncomfortable.
Elistan - An elderly human cleric, thin and scholarly, wearing robes of 
Paladine. His eyes are sharp, assessing the cursed keep with both caution and 
curiosity.
Brother Marius - The cleric from Haven who briefed you about death 
knights. He's here as theological support and witness.
 
GOLDMOON APPROACHES
She walks forward with absolute confidence, the satchel held reverently. Her 
escorts remain behind. She stops thirty feet from Lord Soth's throne and looks 
up at the death knight without fear.
Then she looks at Lady Korinthe - recognizing immediately what she is, what 
she's become.
Finally, her eyes find Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa.
"Brother Cyrus. Johannes. Kessa." Her voice is warm, melodious, carrying 
natural authority. "Commander Laurana told me you sent urgent word. That a 
death knight seeks judgment. That his cursed wife bears witness. That three 
hundred years of penance might end today."
She looks around the Great Hall - the skeletal warriors, the ghostly figures, the 
weight of centuries.
"I confess, when I received your message, I thought it impossible. Death 
knights don't seek redemption. Banshees don't transform peacefully. Curses 
don't simply... wait for judgment."
She looks back at Soth and Korinthe.
"But I brought the Disks of Mishakal. Because impossible things have been 
happening since these holy relics returned to Krynn. And if the gods wish to 
speak judgment here, I will be their vessel."
 
ELISTAN STEPS FORWARD
"I am Elistan, High Priest of Paladine. I have come because if Lord Soth is to 
be judged, it should be by the god he once served. The god whose knight he 
was before his fall."
He looks at Soth with a mixture of sorrow and steel.
"Knight of the Rose. Death Knight of Dargaard. After three hundred years of 
self-imposed penance, do you seek true judgment? Do you petition the gods to 
assess whether your suffering has been sufficient, or whether it must 
continue?"
 
LORD SOTH'S RESPONSE
The death knight stands, descends from his throne, and - for the first time in 
three hundred years - kneels.
Not in submission. But in proper respect before divine authority.
"High Priest Elistan. Bearer Goldmoon. I am Lord Loren Soth, 
Knight of the Rose, Death Knight of Dargaard Keep."
"I failed my divine mission. I chose personal love over the world's 
salvation. Millions died because of my choice. I have borne three 
hundred years of guilt, torment, and curse as consequence."
"I petition the gods for judgment. Not for mercy - I do not deserve 
mercy. But for assessment. Has my penance been sufficient? Or 
must I endure until the end of time itself?"
"I submit myself to divine will. Whatever the gods decree, I will 
accept."
 
LADY KORINTHE SPEAKS
"I am Lady Korinthe, wife of Lord Soth, mother of Peradur. I died 
in the Cataclysm. I rose as a banshee, consumed by rage for three 
hundred years."
"I stand here transformed, no longer raging, seeking truth rather 
than vengeance. I bear witness to Lord Soth's judgment. I will 
speak honestly of his failures and his penance."
"I ask the gods this: Has he suffered enough? Has three hundred 
years of torment balanced the scales? Or must the curse continue?"
She looks at Goldmoon.
"I do not ask for his forgiveness. I ask for divine clarity. Let the 
gods decide what mortal understanding cannot."
 
GOLDMOON OPENS THE SATCHEL
She reaches in carefully and withdraws them - the Disks of Mishakal. 
Ancient platinum disks, inscribed with holy text in languages lost since the 
Cataclysm. They glow with pure divine radiance, filling the Great Hall with 
warmth that hasn't existed here in three centuries.
The skeletal warriors along the walls drop to one knee simultaneously. The 
ghostly figures bow. Even Sir Caradoc, bound to his chapel, can likely feel this 
moment.
"Lord Soth. Lady Korinthe. Before witnesses, before the gods 
themselves, we gather for judgment."
Goldmoon's voice resonates with power beyond her own - Mishakal speaking 
through her chosen vessel.
"Johannes Constantinius, Kessa Darrow, Brother Cyrus - you who 
brought truth to this place, who broke three centuries of isolation 
with mercy and understanding - bear witness. Record what 
transpires."
"Commander Laurana, Elistan, Brother Marius - you who 
represent the living world beyond this curse - bear witness as well."
She places the Disks on the floor before Soth, and they begin to glow brighter, 
their light expanding to fill the entire hall.
 
THE GODS SPEAK
The light becomes overwhelming but not blinding. And then - voices. Not 
words exactly, but presence. Divine judgment made manifest.
MISHAKAL'S PRESENCE (through Goldmoon, warm but 
unflinching): "Loren Soth. You chose love over duty. Personal devotion over 
cosmic responsibility. Your choice led to millions of deaths. This is truth."
PALADINE'S PRESENCE (through Elistan, stern but not cruel): "You were 
my knight. My champion. Given a quest to save the world. You failed not 
from weakness, but from misguided love. This is truth."
THE DIVINE ASSESSMENT BEGINS
The Disks pulse with each statement, as if weighing Soth's very soul:
"Three hundred years you have endured. Three hundred years of guilt. Three 
hundred years of torment. Self-imposed, yes, but genuine. You have not fled 
your punishment. You have not sought escape. You have borne witness to 
your failure every night, reliving the moment of catastrophe."
"Your wife transformed from rage to understanding. Not through your 
efforts, but through the efforts of those who brought truth. Yet her 
transformation reflects upon you - the capacity for redemption exists."
"The Starjewel purified itself when she chose mercy. Divine artifacts respond 
to moral shifts. The curse itself has begun to weaken not because time has 
passed, but because understanding has been reached."
The light intensifies further:
"Loren Soth. The question before us: Has your penance balanced your 
failure? Have three hundred years of suffering equaled the cost of millions of 
deaths and a world broken?"
 
THE JUDGMENT PAUSES
The divine presence seems to wait - not for Soth to answer, but for something 
else.
Goldmoon speaks, her own voice returning: "The gods wish to hear from 
others. Those who bear witness. Those who know what you've become and 
what you were."
She looks at Lady Korinthe first.
"Lady Korinthe. You who suffered most directly from his choice. Speak truth. 
Has he suffered enough?"
 
Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa - you are about to witness Lady Korinthe's 
testimony, then potentially be asked to speak yourselves. This is 
the culmination of everything you've worked toward.
What happens next will determine whether Lord Soth and all those 
bound to him find release, or whether the curse continues.
Wait with baited breath
Dec 10
LADY KORINTHE'S TESTIMONY
She floats forward, positioning herself between Soth and the Disks, her 
spectral form illuminated by their divine radiance.
"Three hundred years ago, I died in terror and pain. I believed my 
husband was a murderer. I believed he let me and our son burn out 
of cruelty or indifference."
"I became rage incarnate. I screamed accusations through these 
walls for three centuries. I killed anyone who entered this place. I 
made this keep a monument to my hatred."
"But three days ago, three mortals showed me truth."
She gestures to Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa.
"They showed me the Cataclysm. They showed me Soth's choice - to 
turn back from his quest, to choose me over the world. They 
showed me him at the Chapel doors, trying desperately to reach us 
and failing because no mortal strength could overcome divine 
judgment."
"They showed me what I became. And they gave me a choice: rest 
for myself, or witness for others."
She turns to face Soth directly.
"Has he suffered enough? I cannot answer that from a place of 
cosmic justice. I am not a god. I cannot weigh millions of deaths 
against three centuries of torment."
"But I can speak to this: He loved catastrophically. He failed 
utterly. And he has never once tried to escape the consequences. 
He has sat on that throne for three hundred years, accepting his 
punishment, never seeking relief, never claiming it was unfair."
"He made the worst choice a knight could make - personal love 
over universal duty. But he made it out of love, not malice. Out of 
devotion, not cruelty."
"And if the gods ask whether a man can love so much that he 
dooms the world... the answer is yes. Soth is proof."
She pauses, her voice becoming softer:
"I do not forgive him. I am not certain I can. But I no longer hate 
him. I understand him. And I believe three hundred years of 
reliving his failure, of hearing his son's screams, of carrying the 
weight of millions of deaths... that is punishment beyond what 
mortal courts could devise."
"So I say to the gods: If you deem his suffering sufficient, release 
him. Release us all. Let this curse end."
"And if you deem it insufficient... then I will remain with him. Not 
as his tormentor, but as his companion in continued penance. We 
will bear this together rather than in isolation."
"That is my testimony."
 
THE DISKS PULSE
The divine light shifts, acknowledging her words, weighing them.
GOLDMOON TURNS TO THE OTHERS
"The gods have heard the wife. Now they would hear from those who broke the 
curse's isolation."
She looks at Cyrus first.
"Brother Cyrus, servant of Mishakal. You transformed Lady Korinthe from 
banshee to peaceful spirit. You have walked these halls, spoken with the 
cursed, seen their suffering. Speak truth. Has Lord Soth suffered enough?"
 
CYRUS STEPS FORWARD
He approaches the Disks, kneels respectfully, then rises to speak:
"I am Brother Cyrus, healer and servant of Mishakal. I have 
witnessed suffering - in battle, in the aftermath of war, in those 
broken by loss and guilt."
"But I have never seen suffering like Lord Soth's. Three hundred 
years of self-imposed torment. Every night, reliving his failure. 
Every day, sitting in judgment of himself more harshly than any 
god could."
"When we arrived, he didn't attack us. He listened. He granted us 
safe passage. He allowed us to investigate, to learn, to bring truth 
to his wife. He showed restraint, honor, and acceptance of 
consequences that many living knights could not match."
"Sir Caradoc, bound to the chapel below, has prayed for three 
hundred years. The knights who followed Soth share his curse not 
because they committed his sin, but because they served him 
loyally. They have borne punishment for another's failure."
"I believe three hundred years is enough. I believe the curse has 
served its purpose - Soth has learned what duty means through its 
catastrophic absence. He has learned the cost of choosing love over 
responsibility. He has learned it so thoroughly that it has become 
his entire existence."
"Mishakal teaches that healing requires both time and 
transformation. Three hundred years is time. The change in this 
keep - the transformation of Lady Korinthe, the purification of the 
Starjewel, the willingness of Soth to seek judgment rather than 
hide from it - that is transformation."
"I say: Release them. Let the curse end. Let those who have 
suffered find rest."
 
THE DISKS PULSE AGAIN
Goldmoon turns to Kessa.
"Kessa Darrow. You who observe, who see truth others miss. Speak. Has Lord 
Soth suffered enough?"
 
KESSA HESITATES, THEN STEPS FORWARD
She's clearly uncomfortable being asked to judge cosmic matters, but she 
speaks honestly:
"I'm not a cleric. I'm not a knight. I'm just... someone who's seen a 
lot of people make terrible choices and live with the 
consequences."
"Lord Soth made the worst choice imaginable. Millions died 
because he chose one woman over the world. That's... that's 
unforgivable in a lot of ways."
"But here's what I saw: When we entered this place, he could have 
killed us. Death knights are powerful enough. Instead, he listened. 
He granted permission. He allowed us to walk freely through his 
domain because we approached with respect rather than greed."
"When we told him his wife wanted to speak with him, he didn't 
rage or blame. He asked if she would have him. Three hundred 
years of her hatred, and his first response was humility."
"And Lady Korinthe - she could have taken her rest, her peace. 
Instead, she chose to stay and witness his judgment. That tells me 
something about who these people were before the curse, and who 
they're trying to be now."
"I don't know if three hundred years balances millions of deaths. I 
can't do that math. But I know that keeping them cursed forever 
doesn't bring back the dead. It doesn't undo the Cataclysm. It just 
perpetuates suffering."
"So yeah. I say release them. Let them rest. They've paid enough."
 
THE DISKS PULSE A THIRD TIME
Finally, Goldmoon looks at Johannes.
"Johannes Constantinius. You who saw the path to truth. You who broke Lady 
Korinthe's rage with mirrors of reality. You who convinced a death knight to 
seek judgment rather than remain in isolation. Speak. Has Lord Soth suffered 
enough?"
 
THE HALL IS SILENT
Every eye - living, dead, and undead - turns to Johannes. Lord Soth kneels, 
head bowed. Lady Korinthe waits. The Disks glow, ready to receive the final 
testimony.
Johannes, what do you say?
Those who have already spoken have shared the thoughts of my own heart 
and mind on this matter. I do not care to add.
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S TESTIMONY
Johannes steps forward, but doesn't kneel. He stands before the Disks with 
the same honest directness he's shown throughout this entire mission.
"Those who have already spoken have shared the thoughts of my 
own heart and mind on this matter. I do not care to add."
His voice is simple, clear, without elaboration or flourish.
 
GOLDMOON STUDIES HIM
For a moment, she seems surprised by the brevity. Then she smiles slightly - 
understanding.
"Sometimes the most profound testimony is agreement. You 
brought them to this moment. Your work speaks louder than 
additional words could."
She turns back to the Disks, which pulse with acknowledgment.
 
THE DIVINE JUDGMENT
The light from the Disks intensifies until the entire Great Hall is bathed in 
radiance. The voices return - MISHAKAL and PALADINE speaking in concert:
"We have heard. Wife and companions. Healer and observer. Truth-bringer 
who needs not elaborate."
"Four witnesses speak with one voice: Three hundred years is sufficient. The 
curse has served its purpose. Transformation has occurred. Understanding 
has been reached."
The light focuses on Lord Soth, still kneeling:
"Loren Soth. You failed your divine mission. You chose love over duty. 
Millions died because of your choice. This cannot be undone. This cannot be 
forgiven in the way mortals forgive."
"But you have borne witness to your failure for three centuries. You have 
punished yourself more thoroughly than we could devise. You have accepted 
consequence without escape, without excuse, without deflection."
"And in the end, when mortals brought truth to your domain, you did not 
resist. You allowed understanding. You sought judgment rather than hiding 
from it."
"This is not redemption. But it is acknowledgment. It is penance completed."
The light shifts to Lady Korinthe:
"Korinthe. You suffered through no fault of your own. You died in terror. You 
rose in rage. But when given the choice between personal peace and bearing 
witness for others, you chose witness."
"This choice breaks the cycle. This choice transforms curse into conclusion."
 
THE JUDGMENT IS PRONOUNCED
"Loren Soth. Your curse is LIFTED. Your penance is COMPLETE. You have 
suffered three hundred years for failing the world out of love. That suffering 
ends now."
"Korinthe. Your suffering is ACKNOWLEDGED. Your transformation is 
WITNESSED. You are released from rage, released from this place, released 
to find peace beyond."
"All who are bound here - Sir Caradoc, the knights who followed, the spirits 
who serve - your vigil ENDS. Your loyalty has been witnessed. Your 
suffering is concluded."
 
THE TRANSFORMATION BEGINS
The cold flames around Lord Soth's armor begin to fade - not flickering, 
but dissolving. The blackened plate lightens, the corruption lifting like smoke. 
Beneath, the armor of a Knight of the Rose, tarnished but whole.
The burning points of light in his eye sockets dim, and then... flesh begins to 
return. Slowly, like ice melting, his undead form transforms. Not back to life - 
that's not possible - but into something peaceful. A body at rest rather than 
cursed animation.
Lord Soth collapses forward, no longer able to sustain his kneeling position. 
He lies on the stone floor as the transformation continues.
LADY KORINTHE'S CHANGE
Her spectral form becomes more solid, more real - and then begins to fade in 
the opposite direction. Not vanishing into nothing, but ascending. Becoming 
pure light, pure spirit, free from earthly binding.
She looks down at Soth one final time:
"We failed together. We suffered together. Now... we rest."
Her form dissolves into silver radiance that rises toward the ceiling and 
beyond.
 
THROUGHOUT THE KEEP
Every witness feels it:
*	Sir Caradoc in his chapel - the armor clatters to the floor, empty. His 
spirit rises, free at last.
*	The skeletal warriors along the walls collapse into dust, their bones 
finally permitted to rest
*	The ghostly figures fade with expressions of relief, finally released 
from their vigil
*	The keep itself - the oppressive cold lifts, the darkness recedes, the 
weight of centuries evaporates
In the space of minutes, Dargaard Keep transforms from cursed fortress to 
empty ruins. Just stone and memory.
 
LORD SOTH'S FINAL MOMENT
He lies on the floor before the throne, his transformation complete. No longer 
a death knight. No longer cursed. Just... a body at rest.
He looks up at Goldmoon, at Elistan, at Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa. His eyes - 
human eyes now, weary beyond measure - show gratitude and peace.
"Thank you."
Two words. Three hundred years of suffering ending in simple gratitude.
"Tell... tell the world... that love can doom as surely as hatred. That 
duty matters as much as devotion. That choices... choices echo 
across centuries."
His eyes close.
"And tell them... that even the damned... can find mercy... if they're 
willing... to face judgment."
His breathing slows. Stops.
Lord Loren Soth, Knight of the Rose, Death Knight of Dargaard Keep, dies 
cleanly. Three hundred years after the Cataclysm, he finally finds the death 
that was denied him.
 
THE GREAT HALL IS SILENT
The Disks' radiance fades to a gentle glow. Goldmoon carefully returns them 
to their satchel.
Commander Laurana and the resistance soldiers stand in awed silence.
Elistan and Brother Marius both have tears running down their faces - 
witnesses to divine mercy they never expected to see.
 
GOLDMOON APPROACHES JOHANNES, CYRUS, AND KESSA
"What you have accomplished here... this will be remembered. Not 
just in military histories, but in theological texts. You broke a 
three-hundred-year curse. You brought a death knight to judgment 
and saw him released. You transformed a banshee into a peaceful 
spirit."
"The gods themselves bore witness to your work. That is... that is 
extraordinary."
 
COMMANDER LAURANA
"I came expecting... I don't know what I expected. A battle, maybe. Or another 
mission. But this?" She gestures to the now-peaceful hall. "This is something 
else entirely."
She looks at the three of you with newfound respect.
"When you're ready, return to Haven. We need to discuss... well, everything. 
What happened here changes our understanding of curses, of redemption, of 
what's possible."
 
THE KEEP IS EMPTY NOW
Just ruins. Just stone. The cursed fortress of Dargaard Keep is now simply 
Dargaard Keep - an ancient fortress, scarred by the Cataclysm, but no longer 
haunted.
Outside, if you were to look, you'd see that Dargaard Village is celebrating. The 
oppressive presence that has hung over them for generations has lifted. 
Children are laughing. People are crying with relief.
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
You have witnessed the conclusion of a three-hundred-year curse. You have 
seen divine judgment enacted. You have accomplished something that will be 
spoken of for generations.
What do you do now? Do you:
1.	Remain at the keep - explore what's left, reflect on what transpired
2.	Go to Dargaard Village - share the news, receive their gratitude
3.	Return to Haven with the delegation - debrief and plan next steps
4.	Something else
And how do you feel about what you've just witnessed?
The Keep is a major strategic point; the resistance must immediately move 
forces to maintain control.
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
Johannes turns to Commander Laurana, his tactical mind already processing 
the implications.
"Commander, Dargaard Keep is a major strategic point. It controls the 
mountain passes, has excellent sight lines, and is structurally sound despite 
the Cataclysm damage. The Dragon Army will realize the curse has lifted - 
they'll move to claim it if we don't."
He gestures to the fortress around them.
"The resistance must immediately move forces to maintain control. Garrison 
it, fortify it, make it a resistance stronghold before the Dragon Army can 
respond."
 
LAURANA'S IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
She nods sharply, her military training snapping into focus after the spiritual 
weight of the judgment.
"You're absolutely right. I was so focused on the divine spectacle that I nearly 
overlooked the tactical reality."
She turns to her escort soldiers. "Kael, ride back to Haven immediately. Fast 
horse, don't stop. Tell Marshal Theros we need a garrison force here - 
minimum fifty soldiers, engineers to assess structural integrity, supplies for 
fortification. Move within 24 hours."
One soldier salutes and sprints from the hall.
Laurana continues: "The Dragon Army had a patrol here eight days ago. They 
died, but their commanders will expect a report eventually. When that report 
doesn't come, they'll send investigators. We have maybe two weeks before they 
realize something significant has changed."
She looks around the Great Hall with new eyes - not as a cursed throne room, 
but as a command center.
"This keep could anchor our entire northeastern defensive line. Control of 
these passes means control of trade routes, troop movements, and access to 
the mountain settlements."
 
GOLDMOON ADDS
"There's another consideration: this place is now sacred. Divine judgment was 
rendered here. The curse of three centuries was lifted. Pilgrims will come. 
Clerics will want to study what happened. This isn't just a military asset - it's a 
spiritual one."
She looks at Elistan, who nods agreement.
"We should establish a small chapel here. Dedicate it to both Mishakal and 
Paladine, honoring both the healing and the judgment that occurred. It would 
serve the garrison's spiritual needs and mark this place as under divine 
protection."
 
ELISTAN'S SUGGESTION
"I will remain here temporarily, if Commander Laurana permits. I can 
consecrate the Chapel of the Order, perform rites to ensure no residual curse 
energy lingers, and serve as spiritual advisor to the garrison until permanent 
clergy arrive."
He looks at the spot where Lord Soth died.
"And we should inter Lord Soth properly. He died redeemed, after divine 
judgment. He deserves burial with honor, not to be left lying in this hall. A 
simple tomb, marked with his name and rank: Knight of the Rose. Let history 
remember he fell, but also that he accepted his punishment and found peace."
 
BROTHER MARIUS
"The lower levels should be cleared thoroughly. Sir Caradoc and the other 
bound spirits are released, but their armor and effects remain. Those should 
be collected, catalogued, and either preserved as historical artifacts or given 
proper burial."
"And the Starjewel-" He looks to where it still rests with Soth's body. "That's 
a holy relic of Paladine. It should be secured, either here in a consecrated 
chapel or transported to a temple for safekeeping."
 
COMMANDER LAURANA'S ORDERS
She's thinking tactically now, issuing rapid decisions:
"Immediate priorities:
1.	Secure the perimeter - My remaining three soldiers will establish 
watch positions until reinforcements arrive.
2.	Structural assessment - Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa - you know this 
keep better than anyone. Can you do a quick survey? Identify which 
sections are stable, which need repair, where we should focus defensive 
efforts?
3.	Local relations - Dargaard Village has lived in fear for generations. 
Someone needs to formally announce the curse is lifted, that the keep is 
now resistance-held, and that we'll protect them from Dragon Army 
retaliation.
4.	Intelligence security - The Dragon Army cannot learn about the 
divine judgment or the Disks being here. Publicly, we say: 'Resistance 
forces cleared the keep of undead through conventional military action.' 
The spiritual truth stays classified.
5.	Soth's internment - Elistan handles this, with full honors. Tomorrow, 
after we've secured the site."
She looks at the three of you.
"You've done the impossible here. But I'm asking for one more day 
of work. Help us secure this place properly. Survey the keep, advise 
on fortifications, help transition this from cursed fortress to 
resistance stronghold."
"After that, you've earned rest. Real rest. And whatever rewards 
Haven can provide."
 
KESSA SPEAKS UP
"What about the Starjewel? That's a powerful holy relic. Leaving it here, even 
in a consecrated chapel, feels risky. The Dragon Army specifically came 
seeking it."
GOLDMOON CONSIDERS
"She's right. The Starjewel is too valuable and too vulnerable here. I'll take it 
with the Disks back to Haven, where we can properly protect it. Eventually, it 
should go to a Temple of Paladine, but until one is re-established..."
She carefully retrieves the gem from where it rests near Soth's body.
"I'll safeguard it. The Dragon Army will never know it was purified."
 
THE PLAN IS SET
Next 24 hours:
*	Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa survey the keep and advise on fortifications
*	Elistan consecrates the Chapel and prepares Soth's burial
*	Laurana's soldiers establish perimeter security
*	Messengers coordinate with Dargaard Village
*	Reinforcements depart Haven (arriving in 2-3 days)
After that:
*	Return to Haven for proper debriefing and rest
*	The keep becomes a resistance stronghold
*	The story of what truly happened remains classified
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
You're being asked to spend one more day here - surveying the keep's tactical 
value, identifying fortification priorities, and helping transition this place from 
supernatural horror to military asset.
Do you:
1.	Accept immediately - begin the survey work
2.	Negotiate terms - request specific compensation or support
3.	Delegate differently - suggest an alternative approach
4.	Ask questions - clarify anything about the plan
What's your response?
The Jewel should stay here. The Dragon Army wanted it because they thought 
that because it was corrupted, they could use it to control Soth and his 
retinue. With it cleansed, Soth redeemed? The Jewel is not only no longer 
within their grasp; it is a living embodiment of Paladine, just as the Disks. 
Leaving it here not only honors Soth and his story; it will actively resist Takhisis 
and her forces far better than even a whole garrison of troops.
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S COUNTER-ARGUMENT
Johannes steps forward, his voice firm and confident.
"The Jewel should stay here. The Dragon Army wanted it because they 
thought that because it was corrupted, they could use it to control Soth and his 
retinue. With it cleansed, Soth redeemed? The Jewel is not only no longer 
within their grasp; it is a living embodiment of Paladine, just as the Disks are 
of Mishakal."
He looks at Goldmoon directly, respectfully but with conviction.
"Leaving it here not only honors Soth and his story; it will actively resist 
Takhisis and her forces far better than even a whole garrison of troops. This 
place was cursed for three centuries. Now it's blessed. That's a weapon the 
Dragon Army can't counter."
 
GOLDMOON PAUSES
She's holding the Starjewel, feeling its warm radiance. She closes her eyes, 
listening - or perhaps praying.
After a moment, she opens them and nods slowly.
"You're right. I can feel it - Mishakal agrees. The Starjewel doesn't want to 
leave. It belongs here."
She looks at Elistan. "What do you think, High Priest? You know Paladine's 
ways better than any of us."
 
ELISTAN'S ASSESSMENT
The elderly cleric approaches, studying the gem with scholarly intensity and 
spiritual sensitivity.
"Johannes speaks truth. The Starjewel was given to Lord Soth as a symbol of 
his worthiness. It corrupted with his fall. It purified with his redemption. This 
isn't just a holy relic - it's a testament."
He gestures around the Great Hall.
"This place witnessed three hundred years of curse, then witnessed divine 
judgment and mercy. The Starjewel anchors that story. If we remove it, we're 
just taking a valuable item. If we leave it, properly consecrated, it becomes 
something greater - a beacon. A ward. A reminder that even the fallen can find 
redemption."
He looks at Johannes with approval.
"And tactically, you're correct. Holy relics actively resist evil. Dragon Army 
forces would find this place... uncomfortable. Dragonborn serving Takhisis, 
dark clerics, undead servants - they'd feel the Starjewel's presence. It would 
weaken them, disadvantage them, make holding this keep nearly impossible 
for them even if they took it by force."
 
COMMANDER LAURANA'S TACTICAL PERSPECTIVE
"So you're proposing we leave a priceless holy relic in a frontier fortress that 
will be under constant Dragon Army pressure?"
She considers this, then slowly smiles.
"Actually... that's brilliant. The Dragon Army knows this keep exists. They 
know it was cursed. They sent a patrol that never returned. If they attack and 
find it garrisoned, they'll think we just cleared out undead and occupied it."
"But if their forces start experiencing unexplained difficulties - exhaustion, 
failed spells, moral degradation, their undead auxiliaries refusing to enter - 
they'll realize something supernatural is at work. They'll think the curse 
persists in a different form. It'll make them hesitant, cautious, afraid."
She nods decisively. "Leave the Starjewel. But we protect it properly."
 
GOLDMOON PLACES THE STARJEWEL
She carries it to the altar in the Chapel of the Order, where it originally rested 
for centuries before the Cataclysm.
"Then here it stays. In the Chapel where Lady Korinthe died and was 
transformed. Where divine judgment was sought and granted. Where the 
curse ended."
She places it carefully on the altar, and immediately the Chapel feels different 
- warmer, brighter, more present.
ELISTAN PERFORMS A QUICK CONSECRATION
He raises his hands over the Starjewel:
"Paladine, Platinum Dragon, God of Justice and Honor - witness this relic's 
return. The Starjewel, once corrupted by curse, now purified by redemption, 
rests here as testament to your mercy. Let it stand as beacon and ward. Let it 
remind all who enter that justice tempered with mercy is the highest virtue. 
Let it resist darkness and strengthen light. So it is witnessed. So let it be."
The Starjewel pulses with brilliant light, then settles into a steady, warm glow.
 
BROTHER MARIUS
"We'll need to establish protocols. The Chapel should be restricted - garrison 
soldiers can pray here, but the altar itself should be guarded. No one touches 
the Starjewel without clerical permission. And we document what it is, what 
happened here, so future garrisons understand they're protecting something 
sacred, not just a pretty gem."
 
LAURANA AGREES
"Understood. The Chapel becomes consecrated ground with restricted access. 
I'll assign guards who understand they're protecting a holy site, not just a 
tactical position."
She looks at Johannes with genuine respect.
"You saw what I missed - that spiritual power is tactical power. That leaving 
the Starjewel here makes this place stronger than any fortification we could 
build."
She extends her hand.
"Thank you. For everything. The mission, the judgment, and this counsel. You 
think like a commander, fight like a champion, and apparently understand 
divine strategy better than most clerics."
 
THE PLAN IS FINALIZED
Dargaard Keep becomes:
*	Resistance military garrison (50+ troops)
*	Sacred site with consecrated Chapel
*	Home of the Starjewel (guarded, restricted access)
*	Strategic stronghold controlling mountain passes
*	Symbolic victory - cursed fortress redeemed and reclaimed
Next steps:
*	Survey the keep (Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa advise)
*	Consecrate the Chapel fully (Elistan leads)
*	Inter Lord Soth with honors (tomorrow)
*	Establish garrison protocols (Laurana coordinates)
*	Spread carefully controlled information to Dargaard Village
 
GOLDMOON APPROACHES THE THREE OF YOU
"You've earned my deepest respect. And Mishakal's attention. What you've 
done here - breaking curses, bringing redemption, thinking strategically about 
divine power - that's rare. Extraordinarily rare."
She looks at Cyrus specifically.
"Brother Cyrus, you transformed a banshee through compassion and wisdom. 
You helped render divine judgment. You're more than a field cleric - you're 
someone Mishakal clearly favors. Remember that."
Then to all three:
"When you return to Haven, seek me out. I'd like to speak with you about... 
possibilities. The gods are returning to Krynn, but they need mortal hands to 
do their work. And you three have proven you understand what that work 
entails."
 
THE SUN IS SETTING
Through the damaged sections of the Great Hall, you can see the sky turning 
gold and red. The oppressive darkness that hung over this place for three 
centuries is gone. It's just a fortress now - scarred, damaged, but clean.
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
You have one more day of work here - surveying, advising, helping secure this 
place. Then you return to Haven as heroes who accomplished the impossible.
Do you want to:
1.	Begin the survey immediately - use remaining daylight
2.	Rest first - it's been an intense day emotionally and spiritually
3.	Visit Dargaard Village - share the news personally
4.	Something else
What's your priority?
Again, I must disagree. It needs no protection; its very nature resists any 
thought or attempt to abuse or misuse it. But instead, let it be freely 
approached, admired, touched even. For those who will be summoned here by 
its call will be those who, like Soth, need the balm of godly judgement, of the 
freedom that comes from acceptance of truth. And we cannot stand in their 
way. They will come, and they will leave transformed. We have nothing to offer 
to aid or hamper their work.
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S VISION
Johannes shakes his head firmly at the talk of guards and restrictions.
"Again, I must disagree. It needs no protection; its very nature resists any 
thought or attempt to abuse or misuse it. But instead, let it be freely 
approached, admired, touched even."
He looks at the Starjewel glowing on the altar, then at the assembled clergy 
and commanders.
"For those who will be summoned here by its call will be those who, like Soth, 
need the balm of godly judgment, of the freedom that comes from acceptance 
of truth. And we cannot stand in their way. They will come, and they will leave 
transformed. We have nothing to offer to aid or hamper their work."
 
SILENCE IN THE CHAPEL
Goldmoon, Elistan, Laurana, and the others exchange glances. Brother Marius 
opens his mouth to object, then closes it.
GOLDMOON SPEAKS FIRST
She approaches the altar, places her hand on the Starjewel, and closes her 
eyes. After a long moment, she withdraws her hand and turns to the group.
"He's right. I can feel it - the Starjewel doesn't need guards. It 
doesn't want guards. It calls to the broken, the guilty, the fallen. Those who 
need redemption will be drawn here, and we have no right to gatekeep divine 
mercy."
She looks at Commander Laurana. "This changes the tactical reality. The 
Chapel isn't a secured treasure vault. It's... a sanctuary. Open to anyone who 
needs it."
 
ELISTAN'S THEOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE
The High Priest of Paladine nods slowly, understanding dawning.
"Of course. How did I not see it immediately?" He looks at Johannes with 
something like wonder. "The Starjewel is no longer just a relic of knighthood. 
It has become something greater through Soth's redemption - it's 
a sacrament of divine judgment and mercy."
"Think of what happened here: Soth sought judgment. The gods rendered it. 
He was released. The Starjewel purified. This entire sequence created 
something new - a place where the fallen can come to face truth and find 
peace."
He gestures to the Chapel around them.
"Guards would profane that. Restrictions would contradict the very nature of 
what this place has become. You don't guard mercy. You don't restrict truth. 
You simply... allow it to exist, and trust that those who need it will find it."
 
COMMANDER LAURANA'S CONCERN
"I understand the spiritual reasoning, but tactically..." She pauses, working 
through the implications. "If the Chapel is open, unrestricted, anyone can 
enter. Including Dragon Army soldiers. Including spies. Including those who 
might try to steal the Starjewel despite its divine nature."
JOHANNES'S RESPONSE? (Or does someone else address her concern?)
 
BROTHER MARIUS INTERJECTS
"Commander, with respect - anyone who enters with intention to steal, to 
abuse, to misuse... the Starjewel itself will judge them. Not violently, but 
spiritually. They'll be confronted with their own truth, their own guilt, their 
own need for redemption. They'll either be transformed or flee."
"The relic doesn't need guards because it is the guard. It protects itself through 
divine judgment. Just as it judged Soth, it will judge all who approach it."
 
GOLDMOON ADDS
"And consider this: if Dragon Army soldiers come here seeking to steal it and 
instead find themselves facing divine judgment of their own sins... we might 
convert more enemies through the Starjewel's presence than we could defeat 
in battle."
"A dark cleric of Takhisis who enters this Chapel thinking to claim a prize 
might leave questioning everything they've done. A dragonborn warrior 
seeking glory might find themselves weeping at the altar, seeking redemption 
for atrocities committed."
"Johannes is right - this place will transform those who come. We cannot 
predict how, but we cannot interfere with it either."
 
ELISTAN PROPOSES A COMPROMISE
"Perhaps this: The garrison protects the keep - the walls, the passes, the 
tactical position. But the Chapel remains open, unguarded, unrestricted. 
Anyone - resistance, Dragon Army, civilian, whoever - can enter freely and 
approach the Starjewel without interference."
"We document what this place is. We make it known throughout the region: 
Dargaard Keep's Chapel is sanctuary. Those seeking judgment, redemption, or 
truth may enter freely, regardless of allegiance. Sacred ground where violence 
is forbidden by divine authority, not mortal guards."
He looks at Laurana. "Your soldiers protect the military asset. The Starjewel 
protects the spiritual one. We trust Paladine and Mishakal to do their work."
 
LAURANA CONSIDERS
"So we hold the keep militarily, but the Chapel becomes... neutral ground? 
Open sanctuary?" She thinks tactically. "Actually... that might 
work better than restrictions."
"If word spreads that Dargaard Keep's Chapel is open sanctuary where divine 
judgment awaits, it becomes something the Dragon Army can't counter. They 
can't assault sanctuary without violating cosmic law. They can't prevent their 
soldiers from seeking it without revealing they're afraid of divine truth."
"And if their soldiers come seeking redemption and leave transformed... that's 
intelligence, potential defectors, and moral damage to their forces."
She nods decisively. "No guards on the Chapel. No restrictions. Open 
sanctuary. My soldiers protect the keep's perimeter and leave the Chapel to 
the gods."
 
THE DECISION IS MADE
Dargaard Keep Chapel becomes:
*	Open sanctuary (no guards, no restrictions)
*	Home of the Starjewel (freely accessible)
*	Place of divine judgment and mercy
*	Neutral ground where all may seek truth
*	Protected by divine authority, not mortal force
Word will spread: "At Dargaard Keep, where a death knight found 
redemption, the Chapel of the Order stands open. The Starjewel of Paladine 
rests there, calling to those who need judgment, who seek truth, who carry 
unbearable guilt. Enter freely. Face yourself honestly. Find peace or flee - but 
the choice is yours."
 
GOLDMOON LOOKS AT JOHANNES
"You see clearly. Not just tactics or strategy, but purpose. You understood 
what this place needs to become better than any of us who've spent lifetimes 
studying theology."
"That's... that's a rare gift."
 
CYRUS SPEAKS QUIETLY
"Johannes, you're right. This place doesn't need guards. It needs witnesses. 
People who will be here when the guilty arrive. Who will be present but not 
interfering. Who will see transformation happen and remember."
He looks at you seriously. "We might need to return here periodically. Not to 
guard, but to bear witness. To see who comes, who changes, who finds peace. 
To document what divine judgment looks like in practice."
 
THE SUN HAS SET
Darkness falls over Dargaard Keep, but it's natural darkness now - not cursed, 
not oppressive. Just night. And in the Chapel, the Starjewel glows softly, a 
beacon for those who need it.
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
Tomorrow you survey the keep's tactical value. Then you return to Haven.
But tonight, you've done something extraordinary: you've created not just a 
military stronghold, but a place of redemption. A sanctuary where divine 
judgment meets mercy. A testament to what's possible when curse transforms 
into blessing.
End of session, or is there anything else you want to do tonight?
I think at this point, we are ready for another level up - can Kessa and Cyrus 
catch up level-wise with Johannes? He'll take another level of fighter.
Dec 10
LEVEL UP - PARTY ADVANCEMENT
Absolutely! After breaking a three-hundred-year curse, facilitating divine 
judgment, and establishing a sanctuary that will transform the spiritual 
landscape of the region, the party has more than earned advancement.
 
NEW PARTY LEVELS:
Johannes Constantinius:
*	Warlock 8 / Fighter 2 (Total Level 10)
*	Takes second level of Fighter
Kessa "Keys" Darrow:
*	Rogue 5 / Bard 5 (Total Level 10)
*	Advances to Bard 5 (catches up to Johannes)
Brother Cyrus:
*	Cleric 10 (Total Level 10)
*	Advances two full levels (catches up to Johannes)
 
JOHANNES - FIGHTER 2
Gains:
*	Action Surge (1/short rest) - Take an additional action on your turn
*	This is huge for combat versatility - double Eldritch Blasts, cast and 
attack, etc.
Current Fighter Features:
*	Fighting Style: Defense (+1 AC while wearing armor)
*	Second Wind (1d10+2 HP, 1/short rest)
*	Action Surge (additional action, 1/short rest)
Current Warlock Features (unchanged):

*	Eldritch Invocations (Devil's Sight, Improved Pact Weapon, Eldritch 
Smite, Thirsting Blade)
*	8th-level spell slots (2 slots, 4th level)
*	Patron: The Fiend
Johannes is now an incredibly versatile combatant - capable of 
massive burst damage with Action Surge doubling his Eldritch 
Blast output.
 
KESSA - BARD 5
Gains at Bard Level 4 (retroactive):
*	ASI/Feat
*	2nd-level spell slots increase
Gains at Bard Level 5:
*	Bardic Inspiration d8 (improves from d6)
*	Font of Inspiration (regain Bardic Inspiration on short rest instead of 
long rest)
*	3rd-level spells
Key New Capabilities:
*	Much more frequent Bardic Inspiration (short rest recovery is huge)
*	Access to powerful 3rd-level spells
Suggested 3rd-level Bard Spells:
*	Hypnotic Pattern (crowd control, incapacitate multiple enemies)
*	Counterspell (critical defensive utility)
*	Sending (long-distance communication)

Korinthe)
ASI/Feat Choice for Bard Level 4: What would Kessa prioritize?
1.	+2 DEX (18 ? 20, improves AC, attacks, skills)
2.	Sharpshooter (feat, massive damage increase for ranged attacks)
3.	Alert (feat, +5 initiative, can't be surprised)
4.	Resilient (CON) (feat, proficiency in CON saves for concentration)
Your choice for Kessa's ASI/Feat?
 
CYRUS - CLERIC 10
Gains at Cleric Level 9:
*	5th-level spells
*	Additional spell slots
Gains at Cleric Level 10:
*	Divine Intervention - Call on Mishakal to intervene directly (10% 
chance of success at level 10, increases with level)
*	Additional spell slots
Key New Capabilities:
*	5th-level spells - Access to Greater Restoration, Mass Cure 
Wounds, Raise Dead, Flame Strike, etc.
*	Divine Intervention - Literal ability to ask Mishakal for miracles in 
desperate situations
This is MASSIVE. Cyrus can now:
*	Remove curses and afflictions with Greater Restoration
*	Bring back the recently dead with Raise Dead
*	Heal entire parties with Mass Cure Wounds
*	Call directly on his goddess in emergencies
Cyrus is now a true high-level cleric with access to miracle-tier 
magic.
 
PARTY POWER LEVEL
You're now a Level 10 party - solidly in Tier 3 (levels 11-16 approaching). 
This means:
*	Regional threats are manageable
*	You can influence major military campaigns
*	Dragons, powerful undead, and high-level villains are appropriate 
challenges
*	You're approaching "heroes of legend" status
The Dargaard Keep mission was perfectly scaled for this 
advancement - it required diplomacy, combat readiness, spiritual 
insight, and strategic thinking at a level that pushed you to your 
limits.
 
MECHANICAL QUESTIONS:
1.	Kessa's ASI/Feat - What does she take for her Bard Level 4 
advancement?
2.	Spell Selections:
*	Kessa needs to choose 2 new Bard spells (any level up to 3rd)
*	Cyrus can prepare different spells from the full Cleric list now 
including 5th-level
3.	Equipment/Attunement Changes - Any adjustments now that 
you're Level 10?
 
NARRATIVE MOMENT:
That evening at Dargaard Keep, after the judgment and the decisions about 
the Starjewel, the three of you find a quiet moment in the Gallery of Ancestors.
Cyrus speaks first: "We broke a three-hundred-year curse. We stood before 
divine judgment. We created a sanctuary. This feels... significant. Like we've 
crossed a threshold."
Kessa: "We're not just adventurers anymore. We're... I don't know what we 
are. But after today, I feel different. Stronger. More capable. Like something 
clicked into place."
She looks at her hands, flexes her fingers. "I can feel it - new techniques, new 
songs, new possibilities. The Font of Inspiration - it's not just bardic training. 
It's understanding what we've done, what we're capable of."
Cyrus: "Mishakal spoke to me. During the judgment. Not words exactly, but... 
presence. Connection. I feel her closer now than ever before. She's trusting me 
with greater power, greater responsibility. Greater Restoration. Raise Dead. 
The ability to call on her directly in emergencies."
He looks at both of you. "We're becoming something more. Not just survivors. 
Not just resistance operatives. We're... witnesses to divine will. Instruments of 
redemption."
 
What are Johannes's thoughts on this advancement, both 
mechanically and narratively?
And what choices for Kessa's ASI and spell selections?
I thought I was Pact of the Tome.
Dec 10
CORRECTION - JOHANNES'S PACT
You're absolutely right! My apologies. Let me correct that:
JOHANNES - WARLOCK 8 / FIGHTER 2
Warlock Features:
*	Pact of the Tome (not Blade)
*	Book of Shadows with three cantrips from any class
*	Eldritch Invocations:
*	Agonizing Blast (CHA to Eldritch Blast damage)
*	Devil's Sight (see in magical darkness 120 ft)
*	Two others (what are your other two invocations?)
Current Warlock Capabilities:
*	8th-level spell slots (2 slots, 4th level)
*	Patron: The Fiend
*	Pact of the Tome utility and versatility
Fighter 2 gains remain the same:
*	Action Surge
*	Fighting Style: Defense
*	Second Wind
 
CLARIFICATION NEEDED:
What are Johannes's four Eldritch Invocations at Warlock 8? We know:
1.	Agonizing Blast (essential for Eldritch Blast builds)
2.	Devil's Sight (used throughout this mission)
3.	???
4.	???
Some likely candidates based on Pact of the Tome:
*	Book of Ancient Secrets (ritual casting from any class)
*	Eldritch Mind (advantage on CON saves for concentration)
*	Mask of Many Faces (Disguise Self at will)
*	Misty Visions (Silent Image at will)
*	Repelling Blast (push enemies 10 ft with Eldritch Blast)
What are your other two invocations?
 
Everything else about the level-up remains the same. Still need:
1.	Kessa's ASI/Feat choice for Bard Level 4
2.	Kessa's spell selections (2 new spells, up to 3rd level)
3.	Johannes's invocation confirmation
Repulsing Blast, One With the Shadows
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S INVOCATIONS CONFIRMED
Eldritch Invocations (Warlock 8):
1.	Agonizing Blast - Add CHA modifier to each Eldritch Blast beam
2.	Devil's Sight - See in magical darkness 120 ft
3.	Repelling Blast - Push targets 10 ft with each Eldritch Blast hit
4.	One with Shadows - Become invisible in dim light/darkness (action, 
until you move or take action/reaction)
Excellent tactical combination - Johannes can control battlefield 
positioning with Repelling Blast, scout/infiltrate with One with Shadows, and 
maintain damage output with Agonizing Blast and Devil's Sight for fighting in 
darkness.
 
STILL NEED DECISIONS FOR KESSA:
1. ASI/Feat for Bard Level 4:
*	+2 DEX (18 ? 20)
*	Sharpshooter feat
*	Alert feat
*	Resilient (CON) feat
*	Other feat?
2. Two new Bard spells (up to 3rd level):
Strong 3rd-level options:
*	Hypnotic Pattern (incredible crowd control)
*	Counterspell (defensive utility)
*	Major Image (improved illusions)
*	Sending (communication)
*	Dispel Magic (utility)
Or any 1st/2nd level spells she might be missing
What are your choices for Kessa?
 
Once we have Kessa's choices locked in, we'll update the character sheet and 
can continue the narrative or wrap up this arc!
And Maddening Hex...
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S INVOCATIONS - FINAL CORRECTION
Eldritch Invocations (Warlock 8):
1.	Agonizing Blast - Add CHA modifier to each Eldritch Blast beam
2.	Devil's Sight - See in magical darkness 120 ft
3.	Repelling Blast - Push targets 10 ft with each Eldritch Blast hit
4.	One with Shadows - Become invisible in dim light/darkness (action, 
until you move or take action/reaction)
5.	Maddening Hex - Bonus action to deal CHA modifier psychic damage 
to hexed target and creatures within 5 ft
Wait - that's 5 invocations. At Warlock 8, you should have exactly 4 
invocations.
Which 4 of these 5 does Johannes have?
1.	Agonizing Blast (essential)
2.	Devil's Sight (confirmed used in missions)
3.	Repelling Blast
4.	One with Shadows
5.	Maddening Hex
Or did you mean Maddening Hex replaces one of the others?
Please confirm Johannes's final 4 invocations so we can lock in the character 
sheet correctly!
 
Still waiting on Kessa's choices as well:
*	ASI/Feat?
*	2 new Bard spells?
We talked about this before and I was told that at level 7, he could have 5. If 
that is not the case, let's forgo the next level of Fighter until he gets 
Maddening Hex.
Dec 10
CHECKING WARLOCK INVOCATION PROGRESSION
Let me verify the correct numbers:
Warlock Invocations Known:
*	Level 2: 2 invocations
*	Level 5: 3 invocations
*	Level 7: 4 invocations
*	Level 9: 5 invocations
*	Level 12: 6 invocations
*	Level 15: 7 invocations
*	Level 18: 8 invocations
You're right that at Warlock 9, Johannes would have 5 invocations. At Warlock 
8, he has 4.
 
REVISED LEVEL UP OPTIONS:
Option A: Take Fighter 2 as planned (current choice)
*	Johannes: Warlock 8 / Fighter 2
*	Has 4 invocations (pick 4 from your list)
*	Gets Action Surge now
Option B: Take Warlock 9 instead
*	Johannes: Warlock 9 / Fighter 1
*	Has 5 invocations (all 5 you listed)
*	Gets 5th-level spell slots (2 slots, still recovers on short rest)
*	Gets access to 5th-level Warlock spells
*	Delays Action Surge
Which do you prefer?
If Option A, which 4 invocations? If Option B, all 5 invocations confirmed: 
Agonizing Blast, Devil's Sight, Repelling Blast, One with Shadows, Maddening 
Hex
 
Also still need Kessa's choices:
*	ASI/Feat for Bard 4?
*	2 new spells for reaching Bard 5?
B. And I'll let you decide for Kessa.

*	Significantly more dangerous in combat and more reliable in infiltration
 
BROTHER CYRUS - CLERIC 10
New Capabilities:
*	5th-level spells: Greater Restoration, Mass Cure Wounds, Raise 
Dead, Flame Strike
*	Divine Intervention: 10% chance to call on Mishakal directly for 
miracles
*	Massive increase in healing and support capacity
 
UPDATED PARTY COMPOSITION - ALL LEVEL 10
Johannes: Warlock 9 / Fighter 1 - Battlefield control, sustained damage, 
infiltration Kessa: Rogue 5 / Bard 5 - Scout, utility, support, crowd 
control Cyrus: Cleric 10 - Healing, divine magic, radiant damage, miracle 
worker
You're now a Tier 3 party capable of handling regional threats, 
powerful undead, dragons, and major military operations.
 
NARRATIVE MOMENT - THE TRANSFORMATION
That evening in the Gallery of Ancestors, after witnessing divine judgment, the 
three of you feel the weight of what you've accomplished settling into your 
very beings.
Cyrus closes his eyes, and for a moment, you see golden light emanate from 
him - Mishakal's presence, closer and more tangible than ever before. When 
he opens them, there's a certainty there that wasn't present before.
"I can feel her. Not just as distant divinity, but as... partnership. She trusts me 
with greater power. Raise Dead. The ability to bring back those who've fallen. 
And Divine Intervention - the capacity to call on her directly when all else 
fails."
Kessa flexes her fingers, and you notice her movements are even more 
precise than before - that assassin's grace refined to supernatural levels.
"Everything feels... sharper. Clearer. I can see the threads of possibility in 
every situation now. And the songs-" She hums a single note, and the air 
shimmers with barely-contained magic. "The songs have deeper power. I can 
turn a battlefield with a melody. I can unmake enemy spells with a counter-
verse."
Johannes, you feel your patron's presence differently now. The binding is 
deeper, yes, but there's also... more. The fifth invocation slots into place like a 
key turning in a lock. Maddening Hex - the ability to spread your curse's 
torment to all nearby. And the fifth-level magic thrumming at the edge of your 
consciousness, waiting to be shaped.
The three of you stand in silence, looking at the portraits of Soth's family - at 
the testament to failure transformed into redemption.
You've become what this mission required: witnesses to divine will, 
instruments of mercy, and champions capable of changing the spiritual 
landscape of Krynn itself.
 
FINAL QUESTION:

RECOMMENDATION BASED ON JOHANNES'S PLAYSTYLE:
Given Johannes's tactical approach, invocation selection, and recent missions:
Top 3 Choices:
1.	Far Step - Synergizes perfectly with Repelling Blast (push enemies 
away, then teleport to safety), One with Shadows (reposition for 
invisibility), and overall hit-and-run tactics. Bonus action teleport every 
turn for a minute is incredible mobility.
2.	Synaptic Static - No friendly fire, high damage, lasting debuff. Perfect 
for the big combat encounters you face. Psychic damage is rarely 
resisted.
3.	Hold Monster - Single-target lockdown that works on ANY creature 
type. Combos with party for massive damage (especially Kessa's sneak 
attack). Can upcast to affect multiple enemies.
Dark Horse:
*	Wall of Force - Unmatched battlefield control and defense, but less 
directly aggressive
 
What does Johannes choose?
Synaptic Static, definitely. And let's go with another mission.
Dec 10
SYNAPTIC STATIC LOCKED IN
Johannes now has access to devastating AOE psychic damage combined with a 
debilitating effect. Perfect for the large-scale combats the party has been 
facing.
Updated Johannes - Warlock 9 / Fighter 1:
*	5th-level spell slots (2 slots, recover on short rest)
*	New spell: Synaptic Static (8d6 psychic damage + 1d6 penalty to 
attacks/checks/concentration)
*	5 Eldritch Invocations fully realized
*	Ready for Tier 3 threats
 
RETURN TO HAVEN - ONE WEEK LATER
The party spent several days at Dargaard Keep helping establish the garrison, 
then returned to Haven. The debriefing with Commander Laurana was 
extensive - the full story of the curse-breaking, the divine judgment, and the 
establishment of the sanctuary.
Word has spread quickly through the resistance: Dargaard Keep is secured. 
The three-hundred-year curse is broken. A death knight found redemption.
The party has become legendary within Haven's ranks. Soldiers salute as you 
pass. Clerics seek your counsel. Even grizzled veterans look at you with 
newfound respect.
 
COMMANDER LAURANA'S OFFICE - MORNING
You're summoned to Laurana's command tent. When you arrive, she's 
studying a map of the region with several markers indicating Dragon Army 
positions.
She looks up as you enter.
"Welcome back. I trust you've had time to rest and process everything that 
happened at Dargaard Keep?"
She doesn't wait for an answer - you can tell something urgent is on her mind.
"We have a situation. Multiple situations, actually. The resistance is growing 
stronger, which means the Dragon Army is adapting. We're seeing increased 
activity on several fronts."
She gestures to the map.
"I have three mission options for you. All are critical, all are dangerous, and all 
require the kind of... unconventional thinking you've demonstrated."
She taps three locations on the map:
 
MISSION OPTION 1: PALANTHAS INTRIGUE
"Our Warehouse 47 in Palanthas has detected unusual activity. Grimbold, 
your caretaker, sent word via magical courier that Dragon Army agents have 
been asking questions about the warehouse's owners. Specifically about you 
three."
"Additionally, there are rumors that a high-ranking Dragon Army officer is 
secretly negotiating with Palanthas city officials - possibly trying to bring the 
neutral city into the Dragon Army's fold through diplomacy rather than force."
"If Palanthas falls to the Dragon Army without a fight, we lose our only major 
neutral staging ground, and the entire coastal region becomes theirs."
Mission objective:
*	Investigate Dragon Army interest in your identities
*	Uncover and potentially sabotage the diplomatic negotiations
*	Maintain Palanthas's neutrality
Complexity: Political intrigue, investigation, potential high-society 
infiltration Danger Level: Moderate combat, high consequences for 
failure Duration: 2-3 weeks estimated
 
MISSION OPTION 2: THE BLOOD SEA CROSSING
"We've received reports from refugees fleeing Dragon Army-occupied 
territories in the east. They speak of a safe passage being organized - ships 
crossing the Blood Sea of Ishan to bring civilians to safer lands."
"But the Dragon Army has noticed. They're positioning naval forces to 
intercept and destroy these refugee ships. Hundreds, possibly thousands of 
civilians will die unless someone can protect the crossing or eliminate the 
Dragon Army naval threat."
"This isn't a stealth mission. This is direct action against a Dragon Army naval 
squadron - likely 5-8 warships, well-armed, with dragonborn marines and 
possibly a dragon providing air support."
Mission objective:
*	Protect refugee ships during Blood Sea crossing
*	Eliminate or disable Dragon Army naval squadron
*	Ensure maximum civilian survival
Complexity: Naval combat, large-scale engagement, protecting civilians 
under fire Danger Level: High combat, high casualty risk Duration: 1-2 
weeks estimated
 
MISSION OPTION 3: THE NIGHTMARE VAULT
"This one's... different. We've had reports from scouts near the ruins of Xak 
Tsaroth - a city destroyed in the Cataclysm. The Dragon Army has been 
excavating something there. Something old."
"Our intelligence suggests they're searching for pre-Cataclysm magical 
artifacts. Specifically, weapons or relics that could tip the balance of power. 
We don't know exactly what they've found, but the excavation site is heavily 
guarded and there's been... strange activity. Scouts report nightmares, 
hallucinations, and one team went missing entirely."
"This feels like another Dargaard Keep situation - something supernatural that 
the Dragon Army is trying to exploit or control."
Mission objective:
*	Infiltrate Xak Tsaroth ruins
*	Determine what the Dragon Army is excavating
*	Secure or destroy whatever they've found
*	Survive whatever supernatural threat is causing the anomalies
Complexity: Dungeon delve, supernatural threats, unknown 
dangers Danger Level: Moderate to high combat, high unknown 
risk Duration: 2-3 weeks estimated
 
LAURANA LOOKS AT YOU
"All three are critical. I'd send you on all of them simultaneously if I could, but 
I can't. You choose which threat you want to handle, and I'll assign other 
teams to the remaining two - though honestly, no one else has your track 
record for handling the impossible."
"Questions? Or do you need time to discuss amongst yourselves?"
Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa - which mission appeals to you?
1.	Palanthas political intrigue
2.	Blood Sea naval combat
3.	Xak Tsaroth supernatural dungeon
1.	But remember we've been to Xak Tsaroth before. That's where we met 
Kisanth and recovered the Disks. Not that is an issue, but just FYI.
Dec 10
EXCELLENT CATCH - CONTINUITY CHECK
You're absolutely right! The party went to Xak Tsaroth early in the campaign, 
recovered the Disks of Mishakal, and made the unprecedented alliance with 
Khisanth the ancient black dragon. That's established canon.
Let me revise Mission Option 3 to reflect this:
 
MISSION OPTION 3 (REVISED): THE NIGHTMARE VAULT
"This one's... personal for you three. Remember Xak Tsaroth? The ruins where 
you recovered the Disks and made that... unusual arrangement with 
Khisanth?"
She taps the location on the map.
"Well, the Dragon Army is back there. And given your history with the place, 
this is concerning. Our intelligence suggests they've pushed deeper into ruins 
you didn't explore - sections that were flooded or collapsed when you were 
there before."
"They're excavating something. Something old and powerful. Scouts report the 
same supernatural disturbances - nightmares, hallucinations, paranoia. One 
scouting team went missing entirely."
"What worries me most is this: Khisanth hasn't stopped them. That dragon 
has claimed those ruins as her domain for centuries. Either she's allowing the 
Dragon Army to dig there, or she can't stop them - and neither option is good 
for us."
She looks at you seriously.
"You have a relationship with Khisanth - if 'relationship' is the right word for 
dtente with an ancient black dragon. You know the ruins. You've navigated 
the supernatural dangers there before. And frankly, if something down there is 
powerful enough that even Khisanth is concerned... we need our best people 
on it."
Mission objective:
*	Return to Xak Tsaroth ruins
*	Determine what the Dragon Army is excavating in the deeper sections
*	Assess Khisanth's status and intentions
*	Secure or destroy whatever artifact or threat they've uncovered
*	Survive the supernatural anomalies
Complexity: Dungeon delve, dragon diplomacy, supernatural threats, 
unknown dangers Danger Level: Moderate to high combat, high unknown 
risk, potential dragon encounter Duration: 2-3 weeks estimated
 
LAURANA ADDS:
"I should mention - we haven't had any communication from Khisanth since 
your arrangement. She's kept her word about not attacking resistance forces, 
but she's been... silent. If the Dragon Army has found a way to threaten or 
coerce her, or if she's decided to switch allegiances..."
She doesn't finish the sentence. The implications are clear.
 
Does this revised Mission Option 3 work better with established 
continuity?
And is this still the mission you want to choose?
Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa - confirm your choice:
1.	Palanthas political intrigue
2.	Blood Sea naval combat
3.	Xak Tsaroth return expedition
And remember Kisanth left Xak Tsaroth and had taken over Pax Tharkas after 
we liberated it? Yes, we've been crazy busy.
Dec 10
ANOTHER EXCELLENT CATCH - FULL CONTINUITY 
CORRECTION
You're absolutely right! After you liberated Pax Tharkas and freed the 700 
prisoners, Khisanth relocated there as part of your alliance agreement. She 
now occupies Pax Tharkas as her new lair, having left Xak Tsaroth.
This changes everything about Mission Option 3:
 
MISSION OPTION 3 (FULLY REVISED): THE NIGHTMARE VAULT
"This one concerns Xak Tsaroth - the ruins where you recovered the Disks. 
You know the place, you've navigated its dangers before."
She taps the location on the map.
"Here's what's changed: After Khisanth relocated to Pax Tharkas as part of 
your arrangement, the Dragon Army moved into Xak Tsaroth. They're 
excavating deep in sections you didn't explore - collapsed chambers, flooded 
tunnels, areas that were inaccessible before."
"They're searching for something. Pre-Cataclysm magical artifacts, weapons, 
relics of power. And they're finding... something. Scouts report severe 
supernatural disturbances - nightmares, hallucinations, paranoia. One entire 
scouting team vanished."
"What concerns me is the timing. Khisanth occupied those ruins for centuries. 
She would have known if there was something dangerous or valuable deep 
below. Either she deliberately left it there when she moved to Pax Tharkas, or 
she didn't know about it - and an ancient black dragon missing something that 
powerful is... troubling."
She looks at you seriously.
"You know the ruins. You've proven you can handle supernatural threats. And 
if the Dragon Army is digging up pre-Cataclysm weapons in a city that was 
destroyed by divine judgment, we need to know what they've found before 
they can use it."
Mission objective:
*	Return to Xak Tsaroth ruins (now Dragon Army occupied)
*	Infiltrate the excavation site in the deeper, previously unexplored 
sections
*	Determine what artifact or threat they've uncovered
*	Secure or destroy it before the Dragon Army can exploit it
*	Survive the supernatural anomalies affecting the area
Complexity: Dungeon delve, Dragon Army forces, supernatural threats, 
unknown ancient dangers Danger Level: High combat (Dragon Army 
garrison), high unknown risk (pre-Cataclysm artifact) Duration: 2-3 weeks 
estimated
Additional consideration: "You could potentially consult with Khisanth at 
Pax Tharkas on the way. She occupied those ruins for centuries - she might 
know what the Dragon Army is digging for, or at least provide intelligence 
about the deeper sections."
 
LAURANA CONTINUES:
"The Dragon Army wouldn't commit significant forces to excavating ancient 
ruins unless they believed something valuable was down there. Given what 
you found last time - the Disks of Mishakal, one of the most important 
artifacts in Krynn's history - I'm betting whatever they're after is similarly 
powerful."
"And the supernatural effects? The nightmares and hallucinations? That 
suggests whatever's down there doesn't want to be found. Or it's defending 
itself. Either way, it's dangerous."
 
Does this fully corrected Mission Option 3 work with your 
established campaign history?
Confirming the three options:
1.	Palanthas political intrigue - Investigate Dragon Army interest in 
your identities, prevent diplomatic takeover of neutral city
2.	Blood Sea naval combat - Protect refugee ships, eliminate Dragon 
Army naval squadron
3.	Xak Tsaroth return expedition - Infiltrate Dragon Army 
excavation, discover what pre-Cataclysm artifact they're uncovering in 
the deep ruins
Which mission does the party choose?
1.	ooc - I'm not really into the political or RP- heavy stuff, FYI.
Dec 10
MISSION ACCEPTED - XAK TSAROTH RETURN EXPEDITION
OOC Note: Understood! I'll focus on tactical/combat/exploration scenarios 
with clear objectives rather than heavy political intrigue or extended social RP. 
Dungeon delving, supernatural threats, combat encounters, and strategic 
problem-solving are the priority.
 
COMMANDER LAURANA
"Xak Tsaroth it is. Good choice - you know the terrain, and frankly, I trust you 
three with supernatural threats more than anyone else after Dargaard Keep."
She pulls out more detailed maps and intelligence reports.
INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:
"Here's what we know:
Dragon Army Presence:
*	Garrison of approximately 60-80 soldiers occupying the upper ruins
*	Engineering corps with excavation equipment
*	At least two clerics (likely Takhisis worship) - possibly dealing with the 
supernatural effects
*	Command structure unknown, but probably a mid-rank officer
The Excavation:
*	Focused on the Temple District's lower levels - areas that were flooded 
or collapsed during the Cataclysm
*	They've been pumping water out, clearing rubble, accessing chambers 
that haven't been entered in 300+ years
*	Work has been ongoing for approximately 3 weeks
Supernatural Effects:
*	Scouts report nightmares becoming more intense the closer they get
*	Hallucinations of past events - people report seeing Xak Tsaroth as it 
was before the Cataclysm
*	Paranoia, distrust among Dragon Army soldiers themselves
*	One resistance scout team (4 people) entered the excavation site and 
never returned
Timeline:
*	Intelligence suggests the Dragon Army is close to breaking through to 
whatever they're seeking
*	Estimate 1-2 weeks before they reach their objective
*	You need to move fast
Route Options:
1.	Direct approach - 5 days travel southeast to Xak Tsaroth
2.	Via Pax Tharkas - 7 days travel (3 days to Pax Tharkas, consult 
Khisanth, 4 days to Xak Tsaroth)
The second option adds time but gives you potential intelligence from 
Khisanth about the deep ruins."
 
COMMANDER LAURANA'S RECOMMENDATIONS:
"My advice:
*	Visit Pax Tharkas first. Khisanth lived there for centuries - she might 
know what's buried deep below. Two extra days of travel is worth 
avoiding walking into something blindly.
*	Prepare for both combat and supernatural threats. Whatever's down 
there is affecting minds.
*	Assume the missing scout team is dead, but be ready if they're not.
*	If you can sabotage the excavation without direct confrontation, do it. 
60-80 soldiers is a lot, even for you three.
*	If you find something too dangerous to move or destroy, seal it and 
report back. We can send a larger force."
She looks at each of you.
"Questions? Supply requests? Or are you ready to depart?"
 
PARTY DISCUSSION:
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA - what are your thoughts?
1.	Route choice: Direct to Xak Tsaroth (5 days) or via Pax 
Tharkas/Khisanth (7 days)?
2.	Supplies needed: Anything specific you want to requisition?
3.	Strategy preference: Stealth infiltration, direct assault, sabotage, or 
reconnaissance first?
What's your approach?
We have Khisanth's scale, so we'll contact her that way as we head to Xak 
Tsaroth. Our relationship isn't the kind that would welcome a drop in visit. 
Let's get moving, folks!
Dec 10
DEPARTURE - JOURNEY TO XAK TSAROTH
"Smart thinking," Laurana agrees. "Khisanth struck me as the type who 
appreciates efficiency over social niceties. Use the scale, get your intelligence, 
and move."
She provides supplies - rations for two weeks, rope, climbing gear, torches, 
three additional Potions of Healing each, and updated maps of the Xak 
Tsaroth region showing Dragon Army positions.
"May the gods watch over you. Report back when you can. And remember - if 
it's too dangerous, retreat and call for reinforcements. We'd rather have you 
alive than dead heroes."
 
DAY 1-2: TRAVEL SOUTHEAST
The journey toward Xak Tsaroth takes you through increasingly desolate 
terrain. The land here still bears scars from the Cataclysm - twisted rock 
formations, dead forests, and an oppressive atmosphere.
On the evening of Day 2, you make camp in a sheltered ravine. The ruins of 
Xak Tsaroth are still three days away, but this seems like a good time to 
contact Khisanth.
JOHANNES - KHISANTH'S SCALE
You retrieve the black dragon scale - large as a dinner plate, gleaming with an 
oily iridescence even in firelight. Khisanth gave this to you after your alliance 
was forged, with instructions on how to contact her.
The scale is warm to the touch and pulses faintly with draconic magic.
To activate it, Johannes needs to:
*	Hold the scale
*	Speak Khisanth's name clearly
*	State the nature of the contact (question, warning, request for meeting, 
etc.)
The scale allows one-way communication - you can speak to her, but she 
responds via magical sending that only the scale-holder hears.
What does Johannes say to Khisanth?
Some suggested elements:
*	Brief greeting acknowledging your alliance
*	Inform her Dragon Army is excavating deep ruins at Xak Tsaroth
*	Ask what she knows about the lower temple levels
*	Request any intelligence about what might be buried there
*	Keep it tactical and direct (as you noted, she appreciates efficiency)
How do you phrase your message?
As stated above
Dec 10
CONTACTING KHISANTH
Johannes holds the black dragon scale, feeling its warmth and the pulse of 
draconic magic within. He speaks clearly:
"Khisanth. Johannes Constantinius. The Dragon Army is excavating the deep 
ruins beneath Xak Tsaroth's Temple District - sections that were flooded or 
collapsed when we last met. They're experiencing supernatural effects: 
nightmares, hallucinations, paranoia. We're en route to investigate and stop 
them. What do you know about what lies in those lower levels?"
The scale grows hot, almost uncomfortably so, then Khisanth's voice resonates 
directly into Johannes's mind - not gentle, but controlled, like distant thunder:
"JOHANNNES CONSTANTINIUS. YOUR TIMING IS... 
CONVENIENT."
"I occupied those ruins for three centuries. The upper levels, the 
accessible chambers, the flooded sections - all known to me. But 
the DEEPEST vaults beneath the Temple of Huerzyd remained 
sealed. Sealed by the Cataclysm itself. Sealed by divine judgment."
"I attempted to breach them twice in three hundred years. Both 
times, the nightmares drove even ME back. What lies below is OLD. 
Pre-Cataclysm. Pre-Kingpriest. Perhaps pre-EMPIRE."
A pause, and you can almost hear her considering whether to share more.
"The Dragon Army excavates what I could not reach. Either they 
are FOOLS, or they possess knowledge I lack. Neither possibility 
pleases me."
"What I know: The Temple of Huerzyd was dedicated to a god 
whose name was STRUCK from history. The priests there dealt in... 
containment. Binding. They imprisoned things that should not 
exist. When the Cataclysm struck, their wards held - barely. What 
lies below is CONTAINED, but three hundred years of isolation 
may have weakened those bindings."
"If the Dragon Army breaches the final seals, they will release 
something that PREDATES THE GODS OF KRYNN. Something the 
ancient priests deemed too dangerous to destroy, so they 
IMPRISONED instead."
"My counsel: STOP THEM. Seal the excavation. Bury it again. Do 
NOT attempt to claim whatever lies below for your resistance. 
Some weapons are not worth wielding."
"And Johannes? If you FAIL, if they breach the seals and release 
what lies dormant... RUN. Do not fight it. Do not study it. RUN, and 
warn your commanders that the Dragon Army has unleashed 
something beyond their control."
"Our alliance stands. I will not interfere with your mission. But I 
will also not AID. What you face in those depths is YOUR concern 
now. I am well satisfied with Pax Tharkas and have no desire to 
return to those cursed ruins."
"One final warning: The nightmares you experience will show you 
TRUTH. Terrible truth. The entity below feeds on knowledge of 
what WAS and what COULD HAVE BEEN. Steel your minds, or you 
will break before you even reach the seals."
The scale cools. The connection ends.
 
CYRUS AND KESSA'S REACTIONS
Both have been watching Johannes during the contact, seeing his expression 
shift as he receives Khisanth's message.
Cyrus: "That looked... ominous. What did she say?"
Kessa: "And why do you look like you just got told we're walking into 
something that scared off an ancient dragon?"
 
JOHANNES - WHAT DO YOU TELL YOUR COMPANIONS?
And more importantly: Does this intelligence change your approach to 
the mission?
You now know:
*	What's below predates even the gods of Krynn
*	It was imprisoned by ancient priests, not destroyed
*	The seals are weakening after 300+ years
*	Even Khisanth was driven back by the nightmares twice
*	The Dragon Army is close to breaching the final containment
*	Khisanth's advice: Seal it, bury it, don't try to claim it
Do you:
1.	Continue as planned - stop the Dragon Army, deal with whatever's 
below
2.	Adjust strategy - focus on collapsing the excavation rather than 
confronting what's inside
3.	Request reinforcements - send word back to Haven that this is 
bigger than anticipated
4.	Gather more intelligence - scout thoroughly before committing
What's your call?
Continue as planned...
Dec 10
JOHANNES RELAYS KHISANTH'S WARNING
Johannes shares Khisanth's message with Cyrus and Kessa - the ancient 
temple, the imprisoned entity predating the gods, the weakening seals, the 
nightmares that drove back even a dragon.
KESSA'S RESPONSE:
"So we're walking into a place that's been sealed for over three hundred years, 
possibly thousands, containing something so dangerous ancient priests 
couldn't destroy it. And the Dragon Army is about to crack it open like a 
treasure chest."
She checks her weapons methodically. "Well, at least we know what we're 
dealing with. Sort of. Better than walking in blind."
CYRUS'S ASSESSMENT:
"Entities that predate the gods... binding magic from civilizations lost to 
history... this is beyond clerical training. But Mishakal's presence is stronger 
now. The Disks have returned. If the ancient priests could contain this thing, 
perhaps divine power can re-seal it."
He grips his holy symbol. "We continue. We stop the Dragon Army. We assess 
the seals. And if necessary, we bury it all and let it stay buried for another 
thousand years."
 
DAY 3-5: APPROACH TO XAK TSAROTH
The final days of travel take you through increasingly twisted terrain. The 
closer you get to Xak Tsaroth, the more oppressive the atmosphere becomes.
Night 3: Cyrus has disturbing dreams - visions of Xak Tsaroth before the 
Cataclysm, a magnificent city full of life, then the moment of destruction. He 
wakes gasping.
Night 4: Kessa dreams of the excavation site - sees Dragon Army soldiers 
digging, their faces twisted with exhaustion and fear, and 
something moving in the darkness below them.
Night 5: Johannes dreams of the sealed chamber - ancient priests performing 
binding rituals, their faces desperate, chanting in languages that hurt to hear 
even in dreams. One priest looks directly at him and mouths: "It must never 
wake."
The nightmares are beginning. And you're still a day away from the ruins.
 
DAY 6: ARRIVAL AT XAK TSAROTH - DAWN
You crest a ridge and see the ruins spread out below in a massive sunken 
valley - exactly as you remember from your first visit, but different.
THEN (Your First Visit):
*	Abandoned, flooded, deadly but empty of organized forces
*	Khisanth's territory, avoided by all
*	Supernatural but dormant
NOW (Current State):
*	Dragon Army encampment in the upper ruins (60+ soldiers visible)
*	Excavation equipment, cranes, pumps working constantly
*	Torchlight from deep below - they've opened sections that were sealed
*	Organized patrols, guard rotations, disciplined military presence
*	The air feels wrong - thick, oppressive, like reality is slightly bent
VISIBLE DRAGON ARMY POSITIONS:
Upper Camp (ruins of the old city):
*	Command tent (officers)
*	Barracks (soldiers)
*	Supply depot
*	Guard posts (4 visible, likely more)
Excavation Site (Temple District):
*	Large opening where they've cleared rubble
*	Ropes, pulleys, wooden supports
*	Constant activity - soldiers carrying equipment in/out
*	Two clerics visible performing what look like protective wards
*	Strange blue-green light emanating from below
Patrol Patterns:
*	4-person patrols circling the perimeter every 2 hours
*	2-person guard posts at excavation entrance
*	Shift change at dawn and dusk
YOUR POSITION:
*	On ridge overlooking the valley, 800 feet from nearest Dragon Army 
position
*	Good cover (rocks, dead trees)
*	Elevated view of entire site
*	Not spotted yet
 
TACTICAL ASSESSMENT TIME
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA - WHAT'S YOUR APPROACH?
Options include:
1.	Reconnaissance First
*	Observe patrol patterns thoroughly
*	Wait for nightfall, scout closer
*	Possibly capture a patrol for interrogation
*	Gather more intel before committing
2.	Stealth Infiltration
*	Wait for night
*	Use darkness, Kessa's stealth, Johannes's One with Shadows
*	Infiltrate excavation site directly
*	Avoid most combat until necessary
3.	Sabotage the Equipment
*	Destroy pumps, collapse supports
*	Force evacuation or slow progress
*	Avoid the sealed chamber entirely
4.	Direct Assault
*	Use surprise and superior positioning
*	Eliminate guards, push to excavation
*	High risk, but fastest approach
What's your plan? And what time of day do you want to move - now 
(dawn), during day, or wait for nightfall?
Nightmares. What about my ring of mind shielding?
Dec 10
EXCELLENT POINT - RING OF MIND SHIELDING
You're absolutely right! Johannes wears the Ring of Mind Shielding, which 
has these properties:
*	Your thoughts can't be read by telepathy or other means
*	You can't be compelled to tell the truth by magic
*	You can't be determined to be lying by magic
*	While wearing this ring, you are immune to magic that allows 
other creatures to read your thoughts, determine whether you 
are lying, know your alignment, or know your creature type
The nightmares are almost certainly magical/psychic in nature - an entity that 
"feeds on knowledge" trying to invade minds.
CORRECTING THE NIGHTMARE EFFECTS:
Johannes: The Ring of Mind Shielding protects you completely. You've had 
no nightmares. Your sleep has been peaceful and undisturbed. The entity 
below cannot touch your mind while you wear the ring.
Cyrus & Kessa: Both experienced the nightmares as described - visions of 
the past, the excavation, the sealed chamber.
 
THIS CHANGES THE TACTICAL PICTURE
Cyrus speaks as you observe the Dragon Army camp:
"Johannes, you haven't had the nightmares, have you? The ring - it's 
protecting you from whatever's down there trying to get into our heads."
He looks exhausted from days of disturbed sleep. "Kessa and I have been 
seeing things. Visions of the past, of what's being dug up. It's... draining. But 
you're clear-headed."
Kessa adds:
"Which means when we go down there, you're our anchor. If Cyrus and I start 
seeing things, hearing things, losing track of what's real - you'll be the one who 
can tell us we're wrong. The one it can't touch."
She manages a tired smile. "Lucky you get to be the stable one for once."
 
STRATEGIC ADVANTAGE:
Johannes being immune to the psychic/nightmare effects means:
*	You can scout the excavation site without mental interference
*	You can lead the team through areas where hallucinations are strongest
*	You're protected from whatever entity is causing the effects
*	You can tell when Cyrus/Kessa are being influenced
However: The ring only protects you. Your companions are still vulnerable.
 
BACK TO TACTICAL PLANNING
You're on the ridge at dawn, observing the Dragon Army camp and excavation 
site below.
What's your approach?
1.	Scout now (daytime) - Johannes uses One with Shadows to get 
closer, scouting while immune to nightmares
2.	Wait for nightfall - Full stealth approach with entire party
3.	Observe patrol patterns first - Spend the day gathering intelligence
4.	Something else
What's the plan?
Observe
Dec 10
DAY 6 - RECONNAISSANCE (DAWN TO DUSK)
The party settles into a concealed observation position on the ridge. Johannes, 
Cyrus, and Kessa take turns watching the Dragon Army camp through the day, 
noting patterns, rotations, and behaviors.
 
MORNING OBSERVATIONS (Dawn - Noon):
Camp Activity:
*	Morning muster: ~65 soldiers visible (confirms intelligence estimates)
*	Shift change at dawn: exhausted night crew replaced by day crew
*	Breakfast distribution: soldiers look haggard, moving sluggishly
*	Two soldiers arguing near command tent - officers separate them 
(discipline problems?)
Excavation Site:
*	Day crew (20 soldiers) enters the dig site
*	Pumps running constantly - water still being removed from lower levels
*	Equipment being lowered: more rope, torches, some kind of metal 
framework
*	The two clerics perform ritual at excavation entrance before day crew 
descends
*	Strange blue-green light pulses from below approximately every 15 
minutes
Guard Rotations:
*	Perimeter patrol: 4 soldiers, clockwise circuit, 2-hour intervals
*	Excavation entrance: 2 guards, replaced every 4 hours
*	Command tent: 2 guards, constant
*	Supply depot: 1 guard, constant
Notable Behavior:
*	Soldiers look exhausted beyond normal duty fatigue
*	Several refuse to approach excavation entrance closely
*	Officers have to physically push some soldiers toward the dig site
*	One soldier vomits near the excavation entrance, gets dragged away by 
comrades
 
MIDDAY OBSERVATIONS (Noon - Late Afternoon):
Incident at Excavation:
*	Commotion below - shouting echoes from the dig
*	Three soldiers emerge running, one screaming
*	Clerics rush down immediately
*	15 minutes later, clerics return carrying one soldier (unconscious? 
dead?)
*	Work continues, but soldiers visibly more reluctant
Command Tent Activity:
*	Officers meeting (4 visible, one appears to be dragonborn - likely 
commander)
*	Heated discussion - gestures toward excavation
*	One officer storms out, appears to be refusing orders
*	Dragonborn commander executes refusing officer on the spot (sword 
through chest)
*	Body dragged away, meeting continues
*	Discipline is brutal but morale is clearly deteriorating
Supply Status:
*	Food stores adequate
*	Torch supply being heavily depleted
*	Rope supplies running low
*	Medical tent seeing steady traffic (mostly exhaustion, some injuries)
Pattern Observation:
*	Day crew rotation: 20 soldiers enter at dawn, different 20 emerge at 
dusk
*	No one stays below ground longer than 12 hours
*	Soldiers emerging look significantly worse than those entering
*	The clerics go down periodically but never stay long
 
LATE AFTERNOON OBSERVATIONS:
Progress Assessment:
*	Equipment being hauled up: broken stone, ancient masonry
*	One piece has recognizable symbols - pre-Cataclysm religious 
iconography
*	Excited conversation near command tent - engineers showing 
something to officers
*	Sense of urgency increasing
Cyrus's Assessment (Religion check: 23): "Those symbols... I recognize 
some of them. They're bindings. Containment wards. And they're broken. 
Whatever they're pulling up, those were the outer seals. If the Dragon Army 
has reached the binding wards, they're close. Very close."
Kessa's Observation (Perception: 25): "Watch the guards at the 
excavation entrance. Every time that blue-green light pulses, they flinch. And 
look - the two clerics just performed another ritual. They're maintaining wards 
to keep something in, not to keep intruders out. They know what they're 
dealing with is dangerous."
 
DUSK - SHIFT CHANGE:
Day Crew Emerges:
*	20 soldiers climb out, clearly traumatized
*	3 are being supported by others, barely conscious
*	2 are weeping openly
*	All look like they've aged years in a single day
*	Officers have to threaten night crew to get them to descend
Night Crew Enters:
*	20 fresh soldiers (relatively speaking)
*	One refuses, gets beaten, dragged toward entrance
*	Clerics perform longer ritual before night crew descends
*	Blue-green light intensifies as they enter
Commander's Announcement (you can barely hear): "...final chamber 
by dawn... breach the seals... High Command promises... glory of Takhisis..."
 
INTELLIGENCE SUMMARY:
Confirmed:
*	~65 soldiers total
*	20 working below at any time (current night crew just entered)
*	2 clerics of Takhisis maintaining wards
*	Dragonborn commander (brutal, determined)
*	Morale deteriorating rapidly
*	Discipline maintained through fear/violence
Timeline:
*	Dragon Army expects to breach final seals by dawn tomorrow
*	You have approximately 12 hours before they reach whatever is 
imprisoned below
Tactical Observations:
*	Soldiers are exhausted, traumatized, reluctant
*	Officers maintaining control through brutality
*	Clerics focusing on containment, not combat readiness
*	No signs of aerial support (dragons, etc.)
*	Camp defenses adequate but not exceptional
Vulnerabilities:
*	Low morale - soldiers might break easily
*	Divided attention between excavation and perimeter security
*	Exhausted troops make poor fighters
*	Kill the clerics ? wards fail ? chaos
*	Destroy pumps ? flooding returns ? excavation halted
 
NIGHTFALL
The sun sets. Torches light the camp. The excavation site glows with that eerie 
blue-green light pulsing steadily.
Cyrus: "We have until dawn. If they breach those seals before we stop 
them..."
Kessa: "Then we move tonight. Question is: do we sabotage, infiltrate, or 
assault?"
 
JOHANNES - TACTICAL DECISION TIME:
You've observed all day. You know the patterns, the weaknesses, the timeline.
What's your plan?
Possible approaches:
1.	Sabotage - Destroy pumps/equipment, collapse excavation entrance, 
prevent the breach
2.	Infiltration - Stealth into excavation, reach the seals before they're 
breached
3.	Decapitation Strike - Kill commander and clerics, chaos breaks the 
operation
4.	Divide & Conquer - Create diversion at camp, small team enters 
excavation
5.	Full Assault - Aggressive attack, overwhelming force
And timing:
*	Now (early night, 8 PM)
*	Midnight (deepest night)
*	Pre-dawn (3-4 AM, just before breach attempt)
What do you do?
I'll break in and destroy the pumps from a distance.
Dec 10
SABOTAGE OPERATION - PUMP DESTRUCTION
JOHANNES'S PLAN:
Infiltrate solo using One with Shadows and Devil's Sight, reach the excavation 
site, destroy the pumps from range with Eldritch Blast, create chaos and 
flooding to halt the operation.
Cyrus and Kessa's reactions:
Kessa: "Solo infiltration? That's my specialty, but..." She looks at Johannes. 
"Actually, you're better suited. The ring protects you from the nightmares, One 
with Shadows makes you invisible, and Eldritch Blast has the range. You don't 
need to get close to the pumps."
Cyrus: "And if something goes wrong, Kessa and I can create a diversion 
from here or provide extraction support. We'll be ready."
 
PREPARATION (8:30 PM):
Cyrus casts buffs:
*	Bless on all three (lasts 1 minute, will cast again when Johannes is in 
position)
*	Death Ward on Johannes (survives one instance of dropping to 0 HP)
Equipment check:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding (active, protecting from psychic effects)
*	Trident of Warning (advantage on initiative, can't be surprised)
*	Amulet of Health (CON 19)
*	All spell slots available
*	Blessed symbol visible
Kessa and Cyrus establish overwatch position:
*	600 feet from excavation site
*	Clear line of sight
*	Ready to provide covering fire or create distraction
*	Cyrus has Sending prepared if emergency communication needed
 
INFILTRATION (9:00 PM - DARKNESS FALLS):
Johannes moves down the ridge using natural cover. The night is dark - only 
torchlight from the Dragon Army camp provides illumination.
Approaching the Camp:
You move to within 300 feet of the perimeter. The patrol just passed - you 
have roughly 1 hour and 45 minutes before they return to this sector.
One with Shadows activated: You step into a shadow between rocks and 
become invisible. You remain invisible as long as you stay in dim light or 
darkness and don't move or take actions.
Movement strategy: Move from shadow to shadow, pause to maintain 
invisibility, advance during guard rotations.
Stealth check: 18 (you're proficient, DEX-based, advantage from 
invisibility)
You slip past the perimeter undetected. The guards are focused inward toward 
the excavation, not outward. Their exhaustion and fear make them poor 
sentries.
 
REACHING THE EXCAVATION SITE (9:30 PM):
You're now 150 feet from the excavation entrance. You can see:
The Pump System:
*	Three large mechanical pumps positioned around the excavation 
entrance
*	Connected by pipes leading down into the dig
*	Constant operation - water being expelled into drainage channels
*	Each pump is roughly 8 feet tall, mechanical, non-magical
*	Two guards standing 20 feet from nearest pump
*	One cleric performing ritual 40 feet away near excavation entrance
The Excavation Entrance:
*	Large opening (20 feet wide) descending into darkness
*	Wooden supports, rope systems, pulleys
*	Blue-green light pulsing from below (you can see it illuminating the 
entrance)
*	Strange sounds: digging, chanting, occasional screams
Positioning: You're in darkness, invisible via One with Shadows, 150 feet 
from the pumps.
Eldritch Blast range: 120 feet
 
TACTICAL ASSESSMENT:
To destroy the pumps, you need to:
1.	Move to within 120 feet (requires moving closer, possibly into dim light 
from torches)
2.	Target pumps with Eldritch Blast (2 beams at Warlock 9, +8 to hit)
3.	Each pump likely has significant HP (object, probably AC 15-17, maybe 
30-50 HP each)
4.	Destroying one pump might be enough to flood excavation
5.	Destroying all three guarantees complete flooding
The Challenge:
*	Once you cast Eldritch Blast, invisibility breaks
*	Guards will respond immediately
*	You're 150 feet from nearest cover
*	Alarm will be raised
Options:
A) Aggressive Blitz
*	Move to 120 feet
*	Cast Eldritch Blast at nearest pump (2 beams)
*	Use Action Surge (Fighter 1) ? cast Eldritch Blast again (2 more beams)
*	Potentially destroy 1-2 pumps in first round
*	Accept that alarm is raised, fight or flee
B) Careful Approach
*	Move even closer (60-80 feet)
*	Target furthest pump first (draws attention away from your position)
*	Destroy pumps sequentially
*	Prepare escape route
C) Maximum Destruction
*	Position to hit multiple pumps
*	Use Repelling Blast to damage pumps AND push guards into hazards
*	Create maximum chaos before extraction
JOHANNES - WHICH APPROACH?
And do you want to:
*	Signal Cyrus/Kessa before attacking (they create diversion 
simultaneously)
*	Attack immediately (surprise, no coordination)
*	Wait for better positioning (guards move, patrol passes, etc.)
What's your move?
Aggressive blitz
Dec 10
AGGRESSIVE BLITZ - PUMP DESTRUCTION
Johannes moves forward through the darkness, closing to exactly 120 feet 
from the nearest pump. He takes position behind a collapsed stone wall - good 
cover, clear line of sight to all three pumps.
One with Shadows breaks as he prepares to act. No longer invisible, but the 
guards haven't noticed him yet in the darkness.
INITIATIVE: (Trident of Warning grants advantage)
*	Johannes: 21
*	Guards: 12
*	Cleric: 8
 
ROUND 1 - JOHANNES'S TURN
Action: Eldritch Blast (targeting Pump #1 - nearest)
Attack 1: d20+8 = 24 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 (Agonizing Blast) = 12 force damage
*	Repelling Blast: Pump is an object, no push effect
Attack 2: d20+8 = 19 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 = 11 force damage
*	Pump #1 Total Damage: 23
The first pump shudders as eldritch energy tears into its mechanical 
components. Gears crack, pipes rupture, but it's still operational - damaged 
but functioning.
ACTION SURGE (Fighter 1 ability):
Eldritch Blast again (targeting Pump #1 to finish it)
Attack 1: d20+8 = 26 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 = 13 force damage
*	PUMP #1 DESTROYED
The pump explodes in a shower of twisted metal and broken gears. Water 
immediately begins backing up through the pipes.
Attack 2: d20+8 = 17 (HIT - targeting Pump #2)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 = 9 force damage
*	Pump #2 damaged but functional
RESULT OF JOHANNES'S TURN:
*	Pump #1: DESTROYED
*	Pump #2: Damaged (9 HP)
*	Pump #3: Undamaged
*	Water beginning to flood back into excavation
 
ALARM RAISED
The destruction of the first pump and the sound of Eldritch Blast impacts 
trigger immediate response:
Guards (2 at excavation entrance): "INTRUDER! SABOTAGE! SOUND 
THE ALARM!"
One guard runs toward the command tent shouting. The other draws his 
sword and moves toward Johannes's position (120 feet away - will take 
multiple rounds to close).
Cleric (40 feet from excavation entrance): Turns toward the 
commotion, sees Johannes in the darkness, begins casting.
Camp Response:
*	Torches light up throughout camp
*	Soldiers scrambling from barracks
*	Officers shouting orders
*	You hear a bell ringing - full alarm
From below the excavation: The blue-green light FLARES intensely. A 
wave of psychic pressure washes over the area - everyone except Johannes 
(protected by Ring of Mind Shielding) feels it.
The two guards stumble, clutching their heads. The cleric screams 
but maintains composure.
 
ROUND 1 - GUARDS' TURN
Guard #1: Running toward command tent (Dash action, moving away)
Guard #2:
*	Moves 30 feet toward Johannes (now 90 feet away)
*	Shouts: "Enemy at the pumps! ENEMY AT THE PUMPS!"
*	Clutching head from psychic wave (disadvantage on next attack)
 
ROUND 1 - CLERIC'S TURN
The cleric of Takhisis raises her holy symbol and casts:
Spiritual Weapon (appears as a spectral black mace)
*	Appears 20 feet from Johannes
*	Attacks: d20+6 = 14 (MISS - Johannes AC 16)
*	The spectral weapon swings and misses
She moves 20 feet closer to Johannes (now 100 feet away)
 
ROUND 2 BEGINS
Situation:
*	Pump #1: Destroyed, water flooding back
*	Pump #2: Damaged (9 HP taken)
*	Pump #3: Undamaged
*	Camp fully alarmed, reinforcements coming
*	1 guard charging your position (90 feet away)
*	1 guard running for help
*	Cleric engaging (100 feet away) with Spiritual Weapon active
*	Psychic pressure from below affecting Dragon Army troops (but not 
you)
*	You estimate 15-20 soldiers will reach your position in 2-3 
rounds
JOHANNES - ROUND 2 ACTION:
Do you:
A) Continue Destroying Pumps
*	Target Pump #2 (finish it off - only 9 HP left)
*	Target Pump #3 (start damaging it)
*	One pump destroyed might be enough to flood excavation
B) Tactical Retreat
*	Pumps severely damaged, mission partially accomplished
*	Fall back toward Cyrus/Kessa position
*	Avoid being surrounded by 20+ soldiers
C) Engage Threats
*	Target the cleric (eliminate magical threat)
*	Target charging guard
*	Buy more time to destroy pumps
D) Create Chaos
*	Target structural supports at excavation entrance
*	Try to collapse the entrance entirely
*	Maximum sabotage
What do you do?
Cast Hex on cleric. 1 eb beam on cleric, 1 on pump #2.
Dec 10
ROUND 2 - JOHANNES'S TURN
Bonus Action: Hex Johannes casts Hex on the cleric (90 seconds 
concentration, disadvantage on WIS checks).
The curse settles over her - dark energy coiling around her form. She gasps, 
feeling the weight of the curse.
Action: Eldritch Blast (split targets)
Beam 1 - Targeting Cleric (100 feet away):
*	Attack: d20+8 = 22 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 (Agonizing) + 1d6 (Hex) = 9 + 4 = 13 force + 
necrotic damage
*	Repelling Blast: She's pushed 10 feet back (now 110 feet away)
The cleric staggers backward from the impact, blood streaming from her nose. 
She's wounded but still standing.
Beam 2 - Targeting Pump #2:
*	Attack: d20+8 = 25 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 = 14 force damage
*	Pump #2 DESTROYED (had 9 HP remaining)
The second pump explodes in a cascade of broken metal and ruptured piping. 
Water pressure immediately doubles - the excavation is flooding rapidly now 
with only one pump partially containing it.
FLOODING EFFECT: Water surges back through the drainage pipes into 
the excavation. You hear shouts of alarm from below - the night crew is being 
flooded out.
 
ROUND 2 - GUARDS' TURN
Guard #1: Still running toward command tent (off-screen)
Guard #2:
*	Affected by psychic pressure (disadvantage)
*	Moves 30 feet closer (now 60 feet from Johannes)
*	Readies sword, advancing cautiously
*	Clearly terrified but following orders
 
ROUND 2 - CLERIC'S TURN
The cleric is Hexed (disadvantage on WIS checks) and wounded (13 
damage taken).
She makes a decision - ignore Johannes, save the excavation.
Action: Casts Control Water (4th level spell)
*	Target: The flooding water in the excavation
*	Effect: Redirect the flow, slow the flooding
*	She's buying time for the Dragon Army to secure whatever they're 
digging for
Spiritual Weapon:
*	Moves 20 feet toward Johannes
*	Attacks: d20+6 = 11 (MISS)
She shouts toward the excavation: "GET THEM OUT! GET WHAT WE CAME 
FOR! I'LL HOLD THE WATER!"
 
REINFORCEMENTS ARRIVING
From the camp:
*	8 soldiers emerge from barracks, forming up (120 feet away)
*	Officers shouting orders
*	Another cleric (the second one) running toward excavation
*	Dragonborn commander visible, armored, drawing greatsword
From below the excavation:
*	Screaming, splashing
*	Blue-green light PULSES violently
*	Soldiers scrambling up ropes, soaking wet
*	One soldier falls, disappears back into water
*	Psychic pressure intensifies
 
ROUND 3 BEGINS
SITUATION:
*	Pump #1: DESTROYED
*	Pump #2: DESTROYED
*	Pump #3: Still operational (but struggling with doubled load)
*	Cleric using Control Water to slow flooding (concentration)
*	1 guard 60 feet from Johannes
*	8 soldiers forming up 120 feet away
*	2nd cleric running toward excavation (100 feet from Johannes)
*	Dragonborn commander organizing response
*	Night crew evacuating from flooded excavation
*	Mission objective partially achieved - excavation severely 
disrupted
TACTICAL ASSESSMENT:
You could:
1.	Finish the job - destroy Pump #3, guarantee complete flooding
2.	Disrupt the cleric - kill/wound her, break her concentration 
on Control Water
3.	Retreat now - 2 of 3 pumps destroyed, flooding occurring, mission 
accomplished
4.	Cause maximum chaos - target excavation supports, collapse 
entrance
FROM OVERWATCH POSITION:
You hear Cyrus's voice via Sending: "Johannes - reinforcements converging 
your position. Extract in 30 seconds or we create diversion. Your call."
 
JOHANNES - ROUND 3:
What do you do?
You have:
*	Hex active on cleric (concentration)
*	2 Eldritch Blast beams available
*	Bonus action available
*	Movement available (30 feet)
*	About 30 seconds before being surrounded
Your move?
Both beams on cleric, Misty Step into shadows as far away as possible.
Dec 10
ROUND 3 - JOHANNES'S TURN
Action: Eldritch Blast (both beams on Hexed Cleric)
Beam 1:
*	Attack: d20+8 = 23 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 (Agonizing) + 1d6 (Hex) = 8 + 5 = 13 force + 
necrotic damage
*	Repelling Blast: Pushed 10 feet back (now 120 feet from Johannes)
Beam 2:
*	Attack: d20+8 = 19 (HIT)
*	Damage: 1d10+5 + 1d6 = 11 + 3 = 14 force + necrotic damage
*	Repelling Blast: Pushed another 10 feet back (now 130 feet from 
Johannes)
Total damage to cleric: 27 this round, 40 total
The cleric screams as eldritch energy tears through her. The second blast 
sends her staggering backward. She collapses to one knee, blood pouring from 
her mouth and nose.
CONCENTRATION CHECK (for Control Water):
*	DC: 14 (half of 27 damage, rounded down)
*	CON save: d20+? = FAILS (disadvantage from Hex on WIS checks 
doesn't apply, but massive damage is enough)
Her concentration BREAKS.
The Control Water spell ends immediately. The flooding she was holding 
back SURGES into the excavation with full force.
CATASTROPHIC FLOODING:
Water rushes into the dig site like a tidal wave. You hear:
*	Screams from soldiers still below
*	Wooden supports cracking and collapsing
*	The roar of rushing water
*	Blue-green light flickering erratically then dimming
The excavation is flooding uncontrollably.
 
Bonus Action: Misty Step
Johannes teleports 30 feet into deep shadow behind a collapsed section of 
ancient wall, moving away from the charging guard and toward the perimeter.
One with Shadows: You become invisible again in the darkness.
Position: Now 150 feet from excavation, in shadows, invisible, moving 
toward extraction route.
 
CHAOS AT THE EXCAVATION SITE
The wounded cleric tries to stand, fails, collapses completely. Dead or 
unconscious.
The second cleric reaches the excavation entrance and sees the disaster:
*	Water pouring in
*	Soldiers drowning or scrambling out
*	First cleric down
*	Saboteur vanished
She begins casting Control Water to replace the first cleric's spell, but it takes 
time.
Dragonborn Commander roars orders: "FIND THE SABOTEUR! SECURE 
THE EXCAVATION! GET THOSE MEN OUT!"
The 8-soldier formation splits:
*	4 move toward where Johannes was (but he's gone, invisible)
*	4 move to help with excavation rescue
From below: A soldier emerges, soaking wet, screaming: "IT'S AWAKE! 
THE SEALS BROKE! IT'S AWAKE!"
Then he collapses, convulsing.
 
THE BLUE-GREEN LIGHT EXPLODES
A massive pulse of psychic energy erupts from the excavation - visible as a 
shockwave of ethereal light.
Everyone except Johannes (Ring of Mind Shielding) must save:
*	Guard charging Johannes's last position: Fails save, drops to 
knees screaming
*	Dragonborn Commander: Succeeds save, staggers but maintains 
composure
*	Dragon Army soldiers: Most fail, several collapse, chaos spreads
*	Second cleric: Succeeds but loses concentration on her spell attempt
From the excavation, something MOVES in the water-filled 
darkness below.
 
KHISANTH'S WARNING ECHOES IN YOUR MIND:
"If they breach the seals and release what lies dormant... RUN."
 
FROM OVERWATCH - CYRUS VIA SENDING:
"Johannes! Whatever was down there - the seals just broke! Get out NOW! 
We're seeing massive psychic emanations!"
 
JOHANNES - EXTRACTION DECISION:
You're invisible, 150 feet from excavation, moving toward perimeter. The 
Dragon Army is in complete chaos - flooding, psychic attacks, something 
awakening below.
Mission accomplished: Pumps destroyed, excavation flooded, operation 
disrupted.
But something worse has happened: The ancient imprisoned entity has 
awakened.
Do you:
A) IMMEDIATE EXTRACTION
*	Sprint toward Cyrus/Kessa position (600 feet away)
*	Get out while invisible and chaos reigns
*	Survive to report what happened
B) OBSERVE BRIEFLY
*	Stay hidden, watch what emerges
*	Gather intelligence on what was imprisoned
*	Risk exposure to whatever is awakening
C) ATTEMPT TO RE-SEAL
*	Approach excavation
*	Try to collapse entrance, re-bury whatever is below
*	Extremely dangerous
What do you do?

Dec 10
IMMEDIATE EXTRACTION
Johannes doesn't hesitate. Khisanth's warning is clear, the mission objective is 
complete, and whatever is awakening below is beyond the scope of this 
operation.
He moves.
 
EXTRACTION ROUTE (Rounds 4-6)
Round 4:
*	Johannes: Dash action (60 feet movement through shadows, 
maintaining invisibility via One with Shadows)
*	Distance from excavation: 210 feet
*	Dragon Army: Complete chaos, soldiers screaming, commander trying 
to restore order
*	Something rises from the flooded excavation - you glimpse it 
peripherally but don't stop to look
Round 5:
*	Johannes: Dash action (another 60 feet)
*	Distance from excavation: 270 feet
*	Behind you: Psychic scream that makes reality bend - but Ring of Mind 
Shielding protects you completely
*	Dragon Army soldiers: Mass casualties, many collapsed
*	The dragonborn commander is fighting something at the excavation 
entrance - you see flashes of his greatsword
Round 6:
*	Johannes: Dash action (60 feet)
*	Distance from excavation: 330 feet
*	Approaching perimeter of Dragon Army camp
*	One guard post ahead - but the guards have abandoned position, 
running toward excavation or fleeing entirely
*	You slip past, still invisible in darkness
Round 7:
*	Johannes: Normal movement, climbing ridge toward Cyrus/Kessa
*	Distance from excavation: 390 feet
*	Behind you: The blue-green light is now a pillar reaching toward the sky
*	Screaming has mostly stopped - replaced by an unnatural silence 
punctuated by wet, tearing sounds
Round 8:
*	Johannes: Continuing climb
*	Distance: 450 feet
*	You can see Cyrus and Kessa's position ahead - they're waving you 
forward urgently
 
REACHING OVERWATCH POSITION (10 minutes after initial 
attack)
Johannes crests the ridge and drops into cover beside Cyrus and Kessa. Both 
look shaken.
Cyrus: "Thank the gods. We felt that psychic blast from here - I thought..." 
He sees you're unharmed. "The ring protected you completely, didn't it?"
Kessa: "Johannes, what the fuck is that?" She points down at the excavation 
site.
 
VIEW FROM THE RIDGE
The Dragon Army camp is devastated:
Casualties:
*	30-40 soldiers down (dead, unconscious, or incapacitated)
*	Remaining soldiers fleeing in all directions
*	Command structure collapsed
*	One cleric confirmed dead (the one you killed)
*	Dragonborn commander: unknown status
The Excavation:
*	Completely flooded
*	Blue-green pillar of light rising 50 feet into the air
*	Something moving at the base of that light
*	Too far to see clearly (800+ feet), but it's large
The Entity: From this distance, you can make out:
*	Vaguely humanoid shape, but wrong
*	15-20 feet tall
*	Composed of water, light, and something else - crystalline? Ethereal?
*	Moving among the remaining Dragon Army forces
*	Each time it touches someone, they collapse instantly
*	It's not pursuing the fleeing soldiers - it's feeding on those who remain
Cyrus (Religion check: 24): "That's... that's an elemental servitor. No, 
older than that. Pre-divine. A primordial fragment. Something from before 
the gods shaped Krynn. The priests didn't imprison a demon or undead - they 
imprisoned a piece of raw creation. Unbound. Incomprehensible. Predating 
morality, predating purpose."
Kessa: "Can it be killed?"
Cyrus: "I don't know. Maybe. But not by us. Not like this."
 
THE ENTITY'S BEHAVIOR
As you watch, the entity:
*	Consumes the psychic energy of the fallen soldiers
*	Grows slightly brighter with each feeding
*	Shows no interest in pursuit of fleeing soldiers
*	Remains near the excavation site
*	The pillar of light begins to fade slightly - as if it's stabilizing
After 5 minutes of observation:
*	The entity stops moving
*	It stands at the excavation entrance, unmoving
*	The blue-green light dims to a steady glow
*	Silence falls over the ruins
It's not rampaging. It's not pursuing. It's just... there.
 
CYRUS'S ASSESSMENT:
"It fed. It stabilized. Now it's... dormant? No, not dormant. Waiting. 
Primordial fragments don't think like we do. They don't have goals or desires. 
They simply are. It was imprisoned because the ancient priests couldn't 
destroy it - and now it's free, but it's not rampaging because it doesn't have the 
concept of rampage."
"It will remain there, at the site of its prison, until something disturbs it. And 
then it will react - not with malice, but with the same dispassion a storm has 
when it destroys a village."
Kessa: "So... we didn't make things worse? The Dragon Army was going to 
breach the seals anyway. We just accelerated it and made sure they couldn't 
control what they found."
Cyrus: "Yes. And no. The entity is free, but the Dragon Army can't use it. 
They've been decimated trying to excavate it, and now they know what they 
awakened. They won't be back."
 
MISSION STATUS:
Objectives: ? Stop Dragon Army excavation (COMPLETE - pumps 
destroyed, excavation flooded) ? Prevent Dragon Army from claiming 
artifact/entity (COMPLETE - Dragon Army decimated, fled) ? Secure or 
destroy the entity (FAILED - entity is free but contained to excavation site)
Casualties:
*	Dragon Army: 40-50 dead/incapacitated, remaining forces scattered
*	Resistance: Zero
*	Primordial Fragment: 1 awakened
Intelligence Gathered:
*	Nature of imprisoned entity confirmed
*	Entity is not actively hostile unless disturbed
*	Xak Tsaroth excavation site now completely untenable
*	Dragon Army operation destroyed
 
CYRUS: "We need to report this immediately. Laurana needs to know that 
Xak Tsaroth now contains an active primordial fragment. The resistance needs 
to cordon off the area, prevent anyone from approaching."
Kessa: "And someone needs to figure out how to re-imprison that thing. Or at 
least keep it dormant."
Cyrus: "That's beyond field clerics. That requires High Priests, ancient lore, 
possibly divine intervention. We've done what we can."
 
JOHANNES - DECISION TIME:
Do you:
A) Depart Immediately
*	Return to Haven (5 days travel)
*	Report to Commander Laurana
*	Hand off the problem to higher authorities
B) Observe Longer
*	Watch the entity for 24-48 hours
*	Gather more intelligence on its behavior
*	Assess if it's truly stable or if it will begin moving
C) Attempt Communication
*	Approach the entity (extremely dangerous)
*	Try to understand its nature
*	See if it can be reasoned with or influenced
D) Attempt Re-Sealing
*	Collapse the excavation entrance
*	Bury it again (temporary solution)
*	Buy time for proper containment
What's your call?
A
Dec 10
IMMEDIATE DEPARTURE TO HAVEN
"We're leaving. Now." Johannes's voice is firm. "Mission accomplished - the 
Dragon Army operation is destroyed. What happens next with that thing is 
beyond our capability. We report to Laurana and let people with ancient lore 
and divine authority handle re-containment."
Cyrus nods with visible relief. "Agreed. That entity is stable for now, but 
we're not equipped to deal with primordial forces. The resistance needs to 
know, and quickly."
Kessa takes one last look at the glowing excavation site. "At least the 
Dragon Army got exactly what they deserved for digging where they shouldn't. 
Let's go before that thing decides it's hungry again."
 
DEPARTURE - NIGHT OF DAY 6
The party moves away from Xak Tsaroth under cover of darkness, putting 
distance between themselves and the awakened entity. The blue-green glow is 
visible for miles behind you, a pillar marking the ruins.
The journey back is uneventful but tense. The nightmares that plagued 
Cyrus and Kessa fade with distance - by the second night, they sleep peacefully 
again.
 
DAY 11 - RETURN TO HAVEN
You arrive at Haven's gates travel-worn but alive. Word of your return spreads 
quickly, and within the hour, you're in Commander Laurana's command tent.
DEBRIEFING - COMMANDER LAURANA
She listens intently as Johannes reports:
*	Dragon Army excavation at Xak Tsaroth
*	Pre-Cataclysm imprisonment of primordial fragment
*	Pump sabotage and flooding
*	Accidental release of the entity
*	Dragon Army casualties and retreat
*	Current status: Entity dormant at excavation site
When Johannes finishes, Laurana is silent for a long moment.
"You destroyed a 60-soldier Dragon Army operation with zero 
friendly casualties. That's extraordinary."
"You also inadvertently released something that ancient priests 
couldn't destroy and could only imprison. That's... concerning."
She studies the map. "But realistically, you had no good options. If the Dragon 
Army had breached those seals on their terms, they might have found a way to 
control or weaponize it. Instead, they're scattered, traumatized, and the entity 
remains at the excavation site not actively threatening anyone."
"That's a tactical win even if it's not a clean one."
 
STRATEGIC ASSESSMENT
Laurana marks Xak Tsaroth on her map with a red warning symbol.
"We'll establish a perimeter - keep civilians and soldiers away. I'll send word 
to Goldmoon and Elistan. If anyone can research how to re-seal a primordial 
fragment, it's our high clerics working with the Disks."
She looks at you three. "This may require another divine intervention. Another 
Dargaard Keep situation where we bring holy authority to bear on something 
beyond mortal capability."
"But that's future work. For now: you've neutralized a Dragon Army threat, 
prevented them from gaining a weapon, and returned with critical 
intelligence."
 
REWARDS & RECOGNITION
"First, compensation for services rendered:"
*	3,000 gold pieces (1,000 gp each) - standard mission payment
*	Commendations - formal recognition within resistance hierarchy
*	Priority requisitions - access to resistance armory/supplies as 
needed
"Second, I have something special for you, Brother Cyrus."
Laurana retrieves a wooden case and opens it, revealing a beautifully 
crafted holy symbol of Mishakal - platinum and sapphires, clearly ancient 
and valuable.
"This was recovered from a pre-Cataclysm temple. Our clerics examined it and 
confirmed it's a Periapt of Wound Closure - a rare healing artifact. You've 
proven yourself worthy of such a relic."
PERIAPT OF WOUND CLOSURE (Rare, Attunement)
*	Stabilize automatically when dying (don't need to make death saves)
*	Regain maximum hit points from Hit Dice spent during short rest
"Wear it with honor, Brother Cyrus. Mishakal has clearly marked you as one of 
her champions."
Cyrus accepts with genuine reverence, tears in his eyes. "I will honor 
this gift. Thank you, Commander."
 
LAURANA CONTINUES
"You three have become something remarkable. Dargaard Keep. Xak Tsaroth. 
Pax Tharkas before that. You handle threats others can't even comprehend."
"The resistance is winning, slowly, because of operatives like you. The Dragon 
Army is powerful, but you've cost them fortress, fleets, excavations, and 
countless soldiers."
She looks at each of you seriously. "Rest. Recover. Spend your gold. You've 
earned it. When I need you again - and I will - I'll send word."
"Dismissed. And thank you. Truly."
 
HAVEN - EVENING
The three of you emerge from the command tent into Haven's bustling 
evening activity. Soldiers training, refugees settling, resistance operations 
humming with purpose.
Cyrus looks at his new holy symbol, the Periapt of Wound Closure 
gleaming in the fading light. "We just keep... surviving. No matter what we 
face. Death knights, primordial fragments, Dragon Army operations. We 
survive."
Kessa: "We do more than survive. We win. Messy sometimes, but we win."
She looks at Johannes. "So what now? Rest? Spend some gold? Wait for the 
next impossible mission?"
 
JOHANNES - DOWNTIME
You have:
*	1,000 gp (plus 550 gp from before = 1,550 gp total)
*	Time to rest and recover
*	Access to Haven's resources
*	Your patron tribute due in approximately 8 months
*	The Binding Tome still offering potential answers
What do you want to do with downtime?
Options include:
*	Research the Binding Tome (patron pact)
*	Train/study (already level 10, but could pursue specific knowledge)
*	Purchase equipment/supplies
*	Check on Master Keldin's progress (Resonance Network - 2 months of 
6-8 elapsed)
*	Visit specific NPCs (Goldmoon, Elistan, Khisanth, etc.)
*	Just rest and wait for next mission
*	Something else
Or do you want to skip to the next mission?
What's your preference?
I dislike the idea of leaving something that dangerous wandering around. 
Rather than wait around, perhaps it might be wise to do some research of our 
own on the subject in Palanthas?
Dec 10
JOHANNES'S PROPOSAL
"I dislike the idea of leaving something that dangerous wandering around," 
Johannes says, his tactical mind already working. "Rather than wait around 
for clerics to research in libraries here, perhaps it might be wise to do some 
research of our own in Palanthas."
He looks at Cyrus and Kessa. "The Great Library there is one of the largest 
repositories of pre-Cataclysm knowledge on Krynn. If anywhere has 
information on primordial fragments, binding rituals, or how the ancient 
priests originally imprisoned that thing, it would be there."
CYRUS'S RESPONSE:
"That's... actually brilliant. We already have connections at the Great Library - 
Master Aldric Brightquill, the Chief Historian. We donated those pre-
Cataclysm documents from Thoradin's Hall. He gave us formal recognition 
and a standing invitation."
He grips his new Periapt of Wound Closure. "And this isn't just tactical 
necessity. This is spiritual responsibility. We released that entity - 
accidentally, but still. Mishakal would expect us to help contain it."
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT:
"Plus we own Warehouse 47 in Palanthas. Free lodging, secure base of 
operations, and Grimbold can update us on that Dragon Army interest 
Commander Laurana mentioned - the one where they were asking questions 
about us specifically."
She grins. "We could handle two problems at once: research the primordial 
fragment and investigate why the Dragon Army is interested in our identities. 
Efficient."
 
RETURNING TO COMMANDER LAURANA
You re-enter the command tent. Laurana looks up, surprised.
"Back already? Did you forget something?"
Johannes explains the plan:
*	Travel to Palanthas (8-9 days)
*	Research primordial fragments at Great Library
*	Use established contacts (Master Aldric)
*	Investigate Dragon Army interest in the party
*	Use Warehouse 47 as base of operations
*	Return with intelligence on how to re-seal the entity
LAURANA'S REACTION:
She considers this, then nods approvingly.
"Initiative. I like it. Waiting for our clerics to research could take weeks, and 
you're right - the Great Library is superior for pre-Cataclysm lore. Master 
Aldric would have access to restricted archives we don't."
"And yes, the Dragon Army asking questions about you three is concerning. If 
they've connected you to Pax Tharkas, Flotsam, and now Xak Tsaroth... they 
might be actively hunting you. Better to know what they know."
She authorizes the mission:
"MISSION PARAMETERS:
Primary Objective: Research primordial fragments and binding/sealing 
rituals at Palanthas Great Library
Secondary Objective: Investigate Dragon Army intelligence operations 
targeting your identities
Resources:
*	Warehouse 47 (your property, fully available)
*	Letter of introduction to Master Aldric (I'll provide formal resistance 
credentials)
*	500 gp operational funds (beyond your personal gold)
*	Two weeks timeline (then report back)
Constraints:
*	Palanthas is neutral territory - no open combat with Dragon Army forces
*	Maintain low profile - you're researching, not raiding
*	If Dragon Army threat is severe, extract and report
Support:
*	Grimbold Ironfoot (your caretaker) is already there
*	Resistance has one agent in Palanthas (codename "Copper") who can 
provide local intelligence if needed
*	Use your Sending Stone if emergency communication required
 
LAURANA'S FINAL WORDS:
"You're taking initiative to clean up a problem you accidentally created. That's 
the mark of true professionals. Go. Research. Learn how to re-seal that thing. 
And find out why the Dragon Army is asking about you."
"May the gods watch over you. And Johannes?" She smiles slightly. "Try not to 
accidentally release any more ancient imprisoned entities while you're there."
 
PREPARATION FOR DEPARTURE
Timeline:
*	Rest tonight at Haven
*	Depart tomorrow morning
*	8-9 days travel to Palanthas
*	Arrive approximately Day 20 of the mission cycle
Supplies:
*	Standard travel gear
*	Letter of introduction from Commander Laurana
*	Formal credentials as "resistance historical consultants"
*	500 gp operational funds
*	Your existing 1,550 gp personal funds
Party Status:
*	Full HP, all spell slots, well-rested
*	Level 10, full capabilities
*	Cyrus now has Periapt of Wound Closure (attunement pending)
 
NEXT MORNING - DEPARTURE
The three of you set out from Haven toward Palanthas. The journey will take 
you northwest through safer resistance-controlled territory, then into the 
neutral zones approaching the great city.
Do you want to:
1.	Skip travel, arrive at Palanthas (begin research/investigation)
2.	Check in with Master Keldin (Ak-Thyln is slightly off-route but 
could check Resonance Network progress - now 2.5 months into 6-8 
month timeline)
3.	Handle something specific during travel
What's your preference?
Check in with Keldin...
Dec 10
DETOUR TO AK-THYLN
The route to Palanthas takes you through the Ak-Thyln region anyway - only 
adding one extra day to check on Master Keldin's progress with the Resonance 
Network.
DAY 3 OF TRAVEL - ARRIVAL AT AK-THYLN
The coastal town looks prosperous and peaceful - a stark contrast to when you 
first arrived here before the Flotsam operation. The Dragon Army invasion 
that would have devastated this region never came, thanks to your destruction 
of the fleet.
Citizens recognize you as you pass through - grateful nods, a few waves, 
children pointing excitedly. You're heroes here.
 
MASTER KELDIN'S WORKSHOP - AFTERNOON
The workshop is exactly as you remember - multiple chimneys smoking, the 
hum of arcane machinery, protective wards shimmering on windows and 
doors.
When you knock, Keldin's voice booms from inside: "It's open! Unless you're 
Dragon Army, in which case it's very much closed and possibly explosive!"
You enter to find the dwarf hunched over a workbench covered in what looks 
like intricate metalwork - three objects that resemble elaborate earpieces or 
small circlets, connected by gossamer-thin silver wires to a central crystalline 
matrix.
He looks up, sees Johannes, and his face splits into a huge grin.
"JOHANNES CONSTANTINIUS! And companions! Perfect timing - 
PERFECT timing!"
He sets down his tools and gestures excitedly at the workbench.
"The Resonance Network. Phase 1. It WORKS."
 
KELDIN'S PROGRESS REPORT
He picks up one of the devices - an elegant silver earpiece with a small crystal 
embedded in it, connected to what looks like a delicate chain that would loop 
around the ear.
"2.5 months of work. Trial, error, breakthrough, more error, more 
breakthrough. But I've cracked Phase 1."
THE PROTOTYPE - RESONANCE NETWORK MARK I:
Design:
*	Three matched devices (earpieces with embedded crystals)
*	Each crystal is linked to the others through sympathetic resonance
*	Worn on the ear (comfortable, doesn't interfere with helmets or hoods)
*	Powered by ambient magical energy - no charges, no daily limits
Capabilities:
*	Silent communication between all three wearers
*	Always-on connection - no activation needed, just think and speak
*	Range: 1 mile currently (Keldin believes he can extend to 5 miles 
with refinement)
*	Telepathic or subvocal - can either think words or whisper them, 
transmission is silent to recipients
*	No language barrier - intent is transmitted, not words (you think in 
Common, recipient "hears" in whatever language they understand)
Limitations:
*	Only works between the three specific devices
*	Cannot add new users without creating new matched sets
*	Interference in areas of heavy magical activity (like active spell battles)
*	Requires line of effect (can't penetrate lead, thick stone, or anti-magic 
fields)
 
KELDIN'S DEMONSTRATION
"Here - try them. Each of you take one."
He hands Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa each an earpiece. They're surprisingly 
light, warm to the touch, and fit comfortably.
"Now, Johannes - think something. Direct it at Cyrus."
Johannes thinks clearly: "Can you hear this?"
Cyrus's eyes widen. "Yes! I heard you - not out loud, but in my head. Clear 
as if you'd spoken."
Kessa: "Wait, I heard it too. All three of us are connected?"
Keldin nods enthusiastically. "Exactly! Any transmission goes to ALL 
wearers simultaneously. Perfect for coordinated operations. When you're 
infiltrating a keep, spread across a battlefield, or split up for reconnaissance - 
you maintain constant communication."
He demonstrates the range by having Kessa walk outside - she can still 
communicate clearly from 200 feet away.
 
PHASE 2 & 3 UPDATE
Keldin brings out his project journal, showing detailed notes and diagrams.
"Phase 2 - Image Transmission:"
"This is proving more difficult. Transmitting thoughts and words - that's 
relatively straightforward sympathetic magic. But transmitting vision? That 
requires scrying-level enchantments integrated into the resonance matrix."
"I've made progress, but I estimate another 6-8 months for Phase 2. The 
technical challenge is immense - essentially creating a scrying sensor that 
moves with the wearer and transmits to others in real-time."
Current estimate for Phase 2: 8-10 months total from project start
"Phase 3 - Scalability:"
"This is actually easier than Phase 2. Once I have the core enchantment 
schema perfected, creating additional matched sets is mostly craftsmanship 
and materials. Each additional 3-device set would cost approximately 1,200-
1,500 gold and take 2-3 weeks to craft."
"The real breakthrough is the central resonance matrix - once that's perfected, 
it's replicable."
 
THE OFFER
Keldin looks at Johannes seriously.
"These three devices - the Mark I prototypes - are YOURS. Take 
them. Field test them. I need to know how they perform in actual 
operations - stress testing, combat conditions, magical 
interference, all of it."
"Use them for a month, then report back. Tell me what works, what 
fails, what needs improvement. That feedback will be invaluable 
for Phase 2 development and for refining the Mark I design."
"And honestly? You three NEED this. After what I've heard about 
your operations - Dargaard Keep, fighting death knights, naval 
assaults - coordinated silent communication could save your lives."
He extends the three devices toward you.
"Mark I Resonance Network. Prototype testing phase. No 
additional cost - you've already funded development. These are 
yours."
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA - RESPONSE?
This is a major tactical upgrade:
*	Silent communication during stealth operations
*	Coordinate in combat without enemies hearing
*	Split party reconnaissance while maintaining contact
*	Emergency calls for help without alerting enemies
*	1-mile range covers most operational areas
Do you:
1.	Accept the prototypes - take them, test them, provide feedback
2.	Decline - wait for Phase 2 completion before field testing
3.	Negotiate terms - discuss specific testing parameters
4.	Ask questions - clarify functionality, limitations, concerns
What's your response?
Accept them.
Dec 10
ACCEPTING THE RESONANCE NETWORK MARK I
Johannes takes the three devices, examining his closely. The craftsmanship is 
exceptional - elegant silver work, a crystal that pulses faintly with warm light, 
surprisingly comfortable when worn.
"We'll field test them thoroughly. Palanthas research mission, then whatever 
comes after. You'll have detailed feedback within the month."
Keldin grins broadly. "Excellent! I knew you'd see the value. Now, some 
practical notes for field use:"
 
OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES
Activation:
*	Simply wear the earpiece - it attunes to you within minutes
*	No command word, no activation ritual
*	Connection establishes automatically when all three devices are worn
Usage:
*	Think clearly what you want to transmit - focus on the intended 
message
*	Can transmit to all wearers simultaneously (default)
*	Cannot selectively transmit to only one wearer (Mark I limitation - Mark 
II might address this)
*	Subvocal option: Whisper quietly, device amplifies and transmits
Range & Limitations:
*	1 mile current range (tested extensively)
*	Line of effect required - cannot penetrate: lead, 10+ feet of solid 
stone, anti-magic fields
*	Magical interference: Heavy active spellcasting nearby may cause 
static or brief interruptions
*	Emotional bleed: Strong emotions may leak through unintentionally 
(fear, panic, pain) - maintain mental discipline
Maintenance:
*	Crystals self-sustaining, draw ambient magical energy
*	Clean with soft cloth if dusty
*	Avoid submersion in water (they'll work, but connection may weaken 
temporarily)
*	If damaged, return immediately for repair
Security:
*	Connection is encrypted through sympathetic resonance - cannot be 
intercepted
*	If one device is destroyed, other two still function together
*	If device is stolen, thief cannot use it (attuned to original wearer)
*	Can be un-attuned by removing for 24 hours
 
KELDIN'S FINAL ADVICE
"Practice using them during your travel to Palanthas. Get comfortable with the 
mental discipline of targeted thought-communication versus just general 
thinking. You don't want to accidentally broadcast 'I really need to piss' to 
your entire team during a stealth infiltration."
He chuckles, then becomes more serious.
"These devices represent months of my life's work and your significant 
investment. They're prototypes, yes, but they're also the foundation of 
something revolutionary. Use them well. Keep them safe. And Johannes - your 
feedback will directly shape Phase 2 development."
"You're not just testing equipment. You're helping create the future 
of tactical communication on Krynn."
 
CYRUS TESTS HIS DEVICE
Brother Cyrus puts on his earpiece, and after a moment of concentration, his 
voice comes through clearly in Johannes and Kessa's minds:
"Mishakal's grace... this is extraordinary. Silent communication during 
healing operations, coordinating divine support during combat, calling for 
help without alerting enemies... Johannes, this changes everything."
KESSA'S ASSESSMENT
She adjusts hers, testing the fit while moving quickly through combat stances.
"Doesn't interfere with my hood or movement. Light enough I barely notice 
it. This is going to make reconnaissance SO much easier - I can scout ahead 
and report without hand signals or risking sound."
She grins. "Though we definitely need to practice not broadcasting every 
random thought. I do NOT want you two hearing my internal commentary 
about bad tavern food or annoying NPCs."
 
PAYMENT & GRATITUDE
Keldin waves off any additional payment. "You've already funded the entire 
project. These prototypes are part of that investment. Just bring me back good 
data."
"Now go - you said you're heading to Palanthas? Research mission? Be careful. 
That city's neutral, but that just means the Dragon Army and resistance are 
BOTH operating there covertly. Keep your heads down."
He walks you to the door, then pauses.
"And Johannes? Thank you. For believing in this project. For funding work 
that others would call impossible. If the Resonance Network succeeds - when 
it succeeds - it's because you saw the potential and invested in it."
"May the gods watch over you."
 
DEPARTURE FROM AK-THYLN
CURRENT PARTY EQUIPMENT:
Johannes:
*	Ring of Mind Shielding
*	Amulet of Health
*	Trident of Warning
*	Resonance Network Mark I (attuned)
Kessa:
*	Bracers of Defense
*	Rope of Entanglement
*	Ring of Feather Falling
*	Resonance Network Mark I (attuned)
Cyrus:
*	Pearl of Power
*	Amulet of the Depths
*	Periapt of Wound Closure
*	Resonance Network Mark I (attuned)
 
DAYS 4-10: TRAVEL TO PALANTHAS
During the journey, you practice using the Resonance Network:
Day 4-5: Basic communication practice - learning to think clearly and 
deliberately Day 6: Range testing - Kessa scouts 3/4 mile ahead, connection 
holds clearly Day 7: Combat coordination practice - mock scenarios with 
tactical callouts Day 8: Emotional discipline - learning to not broadcast stray 
thoughts Day 9-10: Advanced techniques - simultaneous reports, urgent 
interrupts, maintaining connection under stress
By the time you approach Palanthas, all three of you are proficient with the 
devices. The silent communication feels natural, intuitive, and incredibly 
useful.
 
DAY 11: ARRIVAL AT PALANTHAS
The great neutral city rises before you - 50,000 residents, impressive walls, 
the Great Library's towers visible even from miles away. Dragon Army 
presence is evident but subtle - patrols in the streets, officers in taverns, but 
no overt occupation.
You have:
*	Warehouse 47 (secure base)
*	Contact: Grimbold Ironfoot (caretaker)
*	Mission: Research primordial fragments + investigate Dragon Army 
interest in you
*	Resonance Network for coordination
*	Two weeks timeline
Do you want to:
1.	Go directly to Warehouse 47 - establish base, talk to Grimbold
2.	Visit Great Library first - begin research immediately
3.	Reconnaissance - scout the city, assess Dragon Army presence
4.	Something else
What's your approach?
Great library, then the warehouse. Send a runner to let Ironfoot know we're in 
town and get the quarters ready for us.

ARRIVAL AT PALANTHAS - GREAT LIBRARY FIRST
PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENT:
As you enter Palanthas through the main gate (2 gp entry tax paid), Kessa 
spots a street urchin - maybe 12 years old, quick-eyed, clearly looking for 
work.
She tosses him 5 silver pieces. "Know Warehouse 47 in the Eastdock Quarter?"
The boy nods eagerly. "Yes ma'am! Corner lot, three stories, dwarf caretaker!"
"Run there. Tell Grimbold Ironfoot that his employers have arrived and need 
quarters prepared for three. Go now, and there's another 5 silver when we 
arrive and confirm you delivered the message."
The boy sprints off immediately.
Via Resonance Network, Kessa thinks to the group: "Testing the devices 
in an urban environment. Can you both hear me clearly despite all 
the city noise and activity?"
Johannes and Cyrus both confirm - the connection is crystal clear despite 
being surrounded by 50,000 people, street vendors, and general city chaos.
 
THE GREAT LIBRARY OF PALANTHAS - EARLY AFTERNOON
The Library dominates the Scholar's Quarter - a massive structure of white 
marble and soaring towers, pre-Cataclysm architecture that survived intact. 
Scholars in various robes move in and out constantly.
At the entrance, two guards (city watch, not Dragon Army) check visitors:
"State your business."
Johannes presents Commander Laurana's letter of introduction:
"To whom it may concern: The bearers of this letter - Johannes 
Constantinius, Kessa Darrow, and Brother Cyrus - are authorized historical 
consultants working on matters of regional security. They are granted full 
cooperation in accessing historical archives as needed. - Commander 
Laurana, Haven Resistance."
The guard reads it, exchanges a glance with his partner, then stamps it with 
the Library's seal.
"Resistance credentials are honored here. Palanthas is neutral, but 
we're not blind to what's happening in the world. Master Aldric 
Brightquill is in the Historical Archives, third floor, west wing. Tell 
the desk clerk you have authorization."
He returns the letter. "Welcome to the Great Library. Knowledge serves all 
who seek it honestly."
 
INTERIOR - THE GREAT LIBRARY
The main hall is breathtaking:
*	Vaulted ceilings 60 feet high
*	Thousands of books on shelves reaching toward the ceiling
*	Magical lights floating throughout (permanent Light spells)
*	Dozens of scholars reading, researching, taking notes
*	The smell of old parchment, leather bindings, and ink
*	Quiet reverence - this is a temple to knowledge
At the main desk, a human clerk looks up. "How may the Library serve you?"
"We're here to see Master Aldric Brightquill. We have 
authorization and a prior relationship - we donated pre-Cataclysm 
documents several months ago."
The clerk checks a registry. "Ah yes, the Thoradin's Hall documents. Master 
Aldric speaks of those often. Third floor, Historical Archives. I'll send word 
you're coming."
 
THIRD FLOOR - HISTORICAL ARCHIVES
This section is more restricted - fewer scholars, more security, older and more 
valuable texts. A junior archivist leads you through rows of ancient 
manuscripts to a private study room.
Master Aldric Brightquill looks up from a desk covered in open books and 
scrolls. He's in his sixties, human, thin and scholarly, with ink-stained fingers 
and spectacles perched on his nose.
His face lights up with recognition.
"Johannes! Brother Cyrus! And Kessa, yes? The generous donors 
who brought us those magnificent pre-Cataclysm administrative 
records!"
He stands, gesturing enthusiastically. "Those documents have been 
INVALUABLE. We've learned so much about pre-Cataclysm governance, trade 
routes, military organization. Several papers have been published based on 
your contribution!"
He clears space at a large research table. "Please, sit! What brings you back to 
Palanthas? More donations? Or are you seeking knowledge this time?"
 
JOHANNES - HOW DO YOU FRAME YOUR REQUEST?
You need information on:
1.	Primordial fragments (ancient entities predating the gods)
2.	Binding/sealing rituals (how ancient priests imprisoned such 
entities)
3.	Specifically related to Xak Tsaroth (Temple of Huerzyd, pre-
Kingpriest era)
Do you:
A) Full Disclosure
*	Explain exactly what happened at Xak Tsaroth
*	Admit you accidentally released a primordial fragment
*	Request urgent research assistance
B) Academic Interest
*	Frame it as "historical research into pre-Cataclysm containment magic"
*	Don't mention the recent release
*	Keep it theoretical
C) Partial Truth
*	Mention that a dangerous entity has been discovered
*	Imply it's still contained but needs better understanding
*	Request research without admitting your role
D) Something else
What's your approach with Master Aldric?
A
Dec 10
FULL DISCLOSURE TO MASTER ALDRIC
Johannes leans forward, his expression serious.
"Master Aldric, we're not here for academic curiosity. We're here because we 
have an urgent, active threat that requires your expertise."
He lays out the situation methodically:
*	Dragon Army excavating beneath Xak Tsaroth's Temple of Huerzyd
*	Discovery of ancient seals imprisoning something pre-divine
*	Sabotage operation to stop the Dragon Army
*	Accidental breach of the final seals during flooding
*	Release of what appears to be a primordial fragment
*	Entity currently dormant at excavation site but potentially dangerous
*	Need for information on binding/re-sealing rituals
"We released it accidentally while stopping a worse outcome - the 
Dragon Army controlling it. But it's free now, and we need to 
understand what it is and how to re-contain it before it becomes 
active."
 
MASTER ALDRIC'S REACTION
The elderly scholar goes very still as Johannes speaks. His expression shifts 
from enthusiasm to concern to something approaching horror.
When Johannes finishes, Aldric removes his spectacles, cleans them slowly (a 
nervous habit), then puts them back on.
"A primordial fragment. From beneath the Temple of Huerzyd. 
Released after three centuries of containment."
He stands abruptly and begins pacing, muttering to himself:
"Huerzyd... Huerzyd... pre-Kingpriest... that's Age of Dreams era, 
possibly earlier... Temple dedicated to a struck god... containment 
specialists..."
He stops, turns to face you.
"You're telling me that beneath Xak Tsaroth - a city destroyed by 
divine judgment during the Cataclysm - there was an OLDER 
threat? Something the ancient priests couldn't destroy and could 
only imprison? And it's now free?"
Cyrus nods. "Yes. And it's currently dormant at the excavation site. But we 
don't know for how long, or what might trigger it to become active."
Aldric sits heavily. "This is... this is extraordinary. Terrifying, but 
extraordinary. The academic implications alone... but more importantly, the 
immediate danger."
He looks at Johannes with newfound respect.
"You came here immediately to research solutions rather than 
simply reporting and washing your hands of it. That's... that's 
responsible. Admirable, even."
"Very well. You need information on primordial fragments and 
binding rituals. I'll help you. But understand - this kind of research 
requires access to the RESTRICTED archives. The dangerous 
knowledge section. Materials we don't let just anyone examine."
 
RESTRICTED ARCHIVES ACCESS
Aldric stands and begins gathering materials.
"I'm the Chief Historian. I have authority to grant restricted access 
for legitimate research purposes. And if preventing a primordial 
entity from potentially destroying half of Ansalon isn't legitimate, I 
don't know what is."
He writes out an authorization on official Library parchment:
"Authorization for Restricted Archives Access - Level 3 (Ancient Threats & 
Containment Protocols). Granted to Johannes Constantinius, Kessa Darrow, 
Brother Cyrus. Duration: Two weeks. Purpose: Research primordial entities 
and binding rituals. Authorized by Master Aldric Brightquill, Chief 
Historian."
He stamps it with his personal seal.
"This grants you access to materials that would normally require 
months of academic credentials to see. Use it wisely. And please - 
DON'T steal anything or damage the texts. Some of these are 
literally irreplaceable."
 
WHAT ALDRIC KNOWS (Initial Overview)
"I'm not an expert in primordial entities - that's extremely esoteric 
knowledge. But I know where to START looking. Let me give you 
the overview before we dive into the archives:"
PRIMORDIAL FRAGMENTS:
"Before the gods of Krynn shaped the world, there was... chaos. Raw creation. 
Unbound potential. The gods gave that chaos FORM, PURPOSE, ORDER. But 
they couldn't unmake what existed before them - they could only shape it, 
bind it, contain it."
"Primordial fragments are pieces of that original chaos. They don't think as we 
understand thinking. They don't have desires or goals. They simply ARE. They 
exist. They react. They consume."
"The ancient priests - this would be Age of Dreams, maybe 2,000-3,000 years 
ago - discovered some of these fragments and realized they couldn't destroy 
them. So they IMPRISONED them in specially constructed containment sites, 
usually beneath temples, guarded by divine authority."
THE TEMPLE OF HUERZYD:
"Huerzyd... I know that name. Give me a moment."
He pulls a reference tome from his personal shelf, flips through it.
"Here. Temple of Huerzyd. Dedicated to a god whose name was 
STRUCK from history during the Second Dragon War. The god fell 
- not died, but FELL. Became corrupt, twisted, cast down by the 
other deities."
"The temple priests who served that god were left without divine patron. But 
they were experts in one thing: BINDING. Containing. Imprisoning things 
that shouldn't exist. They became... specialists in dangerous knowledge."
"When the Kingpriest rose to power centuries later, he ordered their works 
destroyed, their knowledge burned, their temples sealed. Xak Tsaroth's 
Temple of Huerzyd was sealed approximately 1,000 years before the 
Cataclysm."
"If there's a primordial fragment imprisoned there, it's been contained for at 
LEAST 1,000 years, possibly 2,000 or more."
 
THE RESEARCH PLAN
Aldric lays out a strategy:
"We need to find three things:
1. IDENTIFICATION - What specific type of primordial fragment is this?
*	Look for: Historical records of entities imprisoned beneath Xak Tsaroth
*	Sources: Pre-Kingpriest temple archives, Dragon War era texts
*	Expected time: 1-2 days
2. BINDING RITUALS - How did the priests originally contain it?
*	Look for: Containment protocols from the Temple of Huerzyd
*	Sources: Forbidden ritual texts, containment theory treatises
*	Expected time: 2-3 days
3. RE-SEALING METHODS - How do we put it back?
*	Look for: Modern applications of ancient binding magic
*	Sources: Divine magic theory, clerical dissertations, possibly 
consultation with high priests
*	Expected time: 3-5 days
Total research estimate: 1 week of intensive study, possibly 10 days 
if we hit complications."
 
ALDRIC'S OFFER
"I'll personally assist with this research. This is too important and 
too dangerous to leave to junior scholars. I'll guide you through the 
restricted archives, help interpret ancient texts, and provide 
context for what we find."
"Additionally, I'll send discrete inquiries to other archives - Tarsis has some 
pre-Cataclysm materials, and there's a private collector in Palanthas who 
specializes in dangerous knowledge. Between the Library, those sources, and 
your own investigative skills, we should be able to assemble what you need."
He looks at you seriously.
"This is academic work. Long hours, difficult texts, tedious 
research. Not glamorous. But if we succeed, we might save 
thousands of lives. Are you prepared for that?"
 
PRACTICAL ARRANGEMENTS
Aldric continues:
"The Library closes to general public at sunset, but researchers with 
authorization can work through the night in the restricted archives. I 
recommend you establish your lodging, get settled, then return tomorrow 
morning. We'll begin systematic research then."
"Where are you staying in Palanthas?"
When you mention Warehouse 47:
"Ah, Eastdock Quarter. Excellent location - close enough to reach the Library 
quickly but far enough from Old City politics. Smart."
He provides you with research tokens - small bronze medallions that grant 
unrestricted access to the Library during your authorized period.
"Return tomorrow at dawn. We'll begin with the identification 
research. Bring patience and strong tea - this will be intensive 
work."
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
You have authorization for restricted archives research. Master Aldric is 
personally assisting. You have a structured research plan.
Do you:
1.	Head to Warehouse 47 now - establish base, rest, prepare for 
tomorrow's research
2.	Begin preliminary research today - start immediately even though 
it's afternoon
3.	Split the party - some research, some investigate Dragon Army 
interest
4.	Something else
What's your approach?

Dec 10
DEPARTURE TO WAREHOUSE 47
"We'll return at dawn tomorrow, fully rested and ready for intensive research. 
Thank you, Master Aldric."
Aldric nods approvingly. "Wise. Exhausted minds make poor researchers. 
Rest well. Tomorrow we uncover ancient secrets."
 
EASTDOCK QUARTER - LATE AFTERNOON
The party makes their way through Palanthas toward the docks. The city is 
bustling - merchants, sailors, travelers, and yes, Dragon Army soldiers moving 
through the streets. The Dragon Army presence is noticeable but not 
oppressive - officers in taverns, patrols on corners, but maintaining the fiction 
of Palanthas's neutrality.
Via Resonance Network, Kessa thinks: "Three Dragon Army soldiers 
ahead, two dragonborn and a human. They're watching the street 
traffic. Casual observation or looking for someone?"
Johannes responds: "Keep moving naturally. Don't give them reason 
to focus on us."
You pass without incident - the soldiers barely glance at you. Just three more 
travelers among thousands.
 
WAREHOUSE 47 - ARRIVAL
The familiar three-story building comes into view on its corner lot. Looks 
exactly as you left it months ago - well-maintained, sturdy, the loading dock 
intact.
The street urchin you sent ahead is waiting outside, practically bouncing with 
excitement. "I delivered your message! The dwarf said everything's ready! He 
gave me an extra silver for running fast!"
Kessa hands him the promised 5 silver. "Well done. Now get lost before 
someone decides you're loitering."
The boy grins and sprints off, rich by street urchin standards.
 
INTERIOR - GRIMBOLD'S GREETING
The door opens before you knock. Grimbold Ironfoot stands there - stocky 
dwarf, practical work clothes, discrete and competent as always.
"Welcome back, employers. Your message gave me thirty minutes' warning. 
Upper floors are prepared - three rooms cleaned, beds made, water heated, 
supplies stocked. I assume you're here on business, not tourism?"
His eyes flick to the street briefly - checking if you were followed - then ushers 
you inside and locks the door.
Ground Floor:
*	Everything as you left it
*	Clean, organized, well-maintained
*	Loading dock secure
*	Side entrance functional
*	Grimbold's been an excellent caretaker
"Let's talk upstairs. Ground floor has too many sightlines from the 
street."
 
SECOND FLOOR - SECURE BRIEFING
Grimbold leads you to the large central room on the second floor, closes the 
door, and speaks quietly:
"First things first: Dragon Army has been asking about this 
warehouse. Started about three weeks ago."
He pulls out a small journal with notes.
"Three separate inquiries:
1. Dragon Army administrative officer - came to the Harbormaster's 
office, requested property records for 'recently acquired warehouses in 
Eastdock Quarter.' Your deed transaction showed up in those records. They 
know THREE individuals purchased this property jointly several months ago.
2. Dragon Army intelligence agent (civilian clothes, but I recognized the 
type) - came here directly, claimed to be a prospective buyer, asked about the 
owners. I told him the owners are 'traveling merchants' and provided no 
names.
3. Street informants - local kids have been asking dockworkers about 'three 
foreigners who own Warehouse 47.' Someone's paying for information."
He looks at you seriously. "They're looking for you specifically. They 
don't have your names yet - or if they do, they haven't connected 
them to this property - but they know THREE people matching 
general descriptions purchased this warehouse after significant 
activity in this region."
"Timeline matches: Pax Tharkas liberation, Flotsam fleet 
destruction, Palanthas dock rescue. You've been active, successful, 
and someone in Dragon Army intelligence has noticed the pattern."
 
GRIMBOLD'S ASSESSMENT
"Current threat level: MODERATE."
"They're investigating, but not actively hunting. No raids, no surveillance 
teams, no aggressive action. Just... gathering information. Which means 
they're building a case or a profile before they act."
"My recommendation: Keep low profile while you're here. Don't advertise your 
presence. The warehouse is secure - I've added some basic wards and alarm 
bells. But if Dragon Army intelligence decides this property is worth a closer 
look, those won't stop a determined investigation."
He crosses his arms. "What brought you back to Palanthas? And is it 
going to increase Dragon Army attention or decrease it?"
 
JOHANNES - HOW DO YOU BRIEF GRIMBOLD?
Do you:
A) Full disclosure - Tell him about Xak Tsaroth, the primordial fragment, 
the research mission
B) Partial information - "Historical research at the Great Library, keeping 
our heads down"
C) Minimal details - "Resistance business, need secure lodging for two 
weeks"
D) Ask his advice first - "What would you recommend given Dragon Army 
interest?"
What's your approach?
And separately: Do you want to take any immediate precautions given 
the Dragon Army surveillance?
A then D, is there a discrete exit outside of visuals? Like through the 
basement? Also, maybe some actors who could replicate us lazing about on 
the second and third floors to keep attention?
Dec 10
FULL DISCLOSURE TO GRIMBOLD
Johannes lays out the situation methodically - Xak Tsaroth excavation, 
primordial fragment, sabotage operation, accidental release, research mission 
at Great Library, two-week timeline.
Grimbold listens without interruption, his expression growing more serious.
When Johannes finishes: "So you're researching how to re-imprison 
something that predates the gods, while Dragon Army intelligence 
is trying to identify who keeps disrupting their operations. And you 
need to do this for two weeks without drawing attention."
He strokes his beard thoughtfully. "Well, at least you're not boring 
employers."
 
GRIMBOLD'S TACTICAL ASSESSMENT
"First question: Is there a discrete exit outside of visuals? Like 
through the basement?"
Grimbold nods. "Yes, actually. Let me show you."
He leads you down to the ground floor, then to a corner near the loading dock. 
He moves several crates aside, revealing a trapdoor.
"Basement - original construction, pre-Cataclysm. When I took 
over as caretaker, I explored thoroughly."
 
THE BASEMENT
Down a wooden ladder into a stone-walled chamber - dry, cool, approximately 
30 feet by 40 feet. Storage space, mostly empty now.
But Grimbold leads you to the far wall and presses a specific stone. A section 
of wall swings inward - hidden door, well-maintained hinges.
"Smuggler's tunnel. Pre-Cataclysm merchants used these all over 
Eastdock. This one runs 80 feet east, exits into an abandoned 
building three lots over. I've kept it maintained but haven't 
advertised its existence."
He lights a lantern and leads you through - low tunnel, shored up with timber, 
dry and stable. Emerges in the cellar of a dilapidated warehouse that appears 
abandoned from street level.
"Exit here, you're three buildings away from Warehouse 47. No 
direct sightline. Anyone watching your warehouse won't see you 
leave. I use this for... discrete errands."
Back in your basement: "So yes, you have a hidden exit. I recommend 
using it for your Library trips. Enter and leave Warehouse 47 
publicly once or twice to maintain appearances, but do your actual 
research comings and goings through the tunnel."
 
GRIMBOLD'S RESPONSE TO THE DECOY IDEA
"Second question: Actors to replicate you lazing about on the 
second and third floors?"
Grimbold grins - first genuine smile you've seen from him.
"Now THAT is thinking like a professional. Yes, I can arrange that. 
Eastdock has plenty of out-of-work sailors and dockworkers who'd 
appreciate easy coin for sitting around visible in windows."
His proposal:
"Give me until tomorrow afternoon. I'll hire three people - rough 
matches for your builds and general appearance. They don't need 
to be perfect; they just need to be visible from the street at regular 
intervals."
Casting requirements:
*	Johannes stand-in: Human male, tall, dark-haired, similar build
*	Kessa stand-in: Human female, lean build, hooded when visible
*	Cyrus stand-in: Human male, clerical robes, holy symbol visible
"I'll brief them: 'Three traveling merchants renting the warehouse, 
keeping irregular hours, want privacy.' They'll appear in windows 
periodically, move around the building, maintain the illusion of 
occupation. They won't enter the basement or touch anything 
sensitive - just visible presence."
Cost: 5 gold per day for all three (covers their wages plus 
Grimbold's arrangement fee)
Timeline: Can have them in place by tomorrow afternoon, 
maintain for as long as you need
"Meanwhile, YOU three use the tunnel for actual movements. 
Anyone watching sees 'three occupants' maintaining normal 
patterns, while you're actually conducting research and operations 
the Dragon Army doesn't know about."
 
GRIMBOLD'S ADDITIONAL ADVICE
"Regarding Dragon Army surveillance, here's what I know from 
dockside intelligence:"
Current Dragon Army Focus:
*	They're trying to connect incidents: Pax Tharkas, Flotsam, possibly 
others
*	Looking for a "specialized resistance cell" - small, elite, highly effective
*	Don't have names yet, but they have descriptions: "two humans and a 
cleric," "three-person team with unusual capabilities"
*	Their intelligence network in Palanthas is good but not omniscient
Grimbold's Recommendations:
1. Vary your appearance when moving through the city
*	Kessa: Different cloak colors, vary the hood
*	Johannes: Add/remove hat, change coat
*	Cyrus: Hide holy symbol when not needed, wear civilian clothes 
occasionally
*	"Not disguises, just... not looking EXACTLY like the descriptions every 
time"
2. Split up for some movements
*	"Three people together is memorable. One or two is normal city traffic."
*	Use Resonance Network to coordinate while separated
3. Avoid patterns
*	"Don't leave at the same time every day, don't take the same route"
*	Use the tunnel for important trips (Library), use front door for mundane 
errands
4. Establish cover story
*	"If questioned directly: you're historical consultants researching trade 
route histories"
*	"Boring, academic, explains Library visits, gives you reason to be here"
5. Emergency protocols
*	"If Dragon Army raids: I have alarm bells throughout the building"
*	"Escape route: basement tunnel, emerges three buildings over"
*	"Rally point: The Broken Keel tavern, two blocks south - discrete, 
resistance-friendly"
 
GRIMBOLD'S FINAL QUESTION
"Two weeks of research, decoy actors, discrete movements, and 
keeping Dragon Army intelligence off your trail. I can manage all of 
that. But here's what I need to know:"
"If Dragon Army DOES identify you while you're here - if they 
connect Johannes Constantinius and companions to Warehouse 47 
- what's the plan? Fight? Flight? Do I evacuate the decoys and 
prepare for a siege? Or do you have extraction protocols?"
"I'm not afraid of Dragon Army attention, but I need to know the 
plan if things go sideways."
 
JOHANNES - YOUR RESPONSE:
Do you:
1.	Accept all of Grimbold's arrangements (tunnel usage, decoy 
actors for 5gp/day, appearance variations)
2.	Modify the plan (different approach to something)
3.	Establish emergency protocols (what happens if you're 
compromised)
4.	Ask additional questions
And what ARE your emergency protocols if Dragon Army identifies 
you during this mission?
Ooc - I REALLY don't want to do the political intrigue plot line.
7:06 AM
OOC ACKNOWLEDGED
Got it - you want to focus on the primordial fragment research and avoid the 
political intrigue/Dragon Army surveillance plotline. Let me streamline this.
 
GRIMBOLD'S ARRANGEMENTS - SIMPLIFIED
Johannes accepts Grimbold's security arrangements:
*	Hidden tunnel for discrete Library access
*	Decoy actors (5 gp/day)
*	Basic operational security
"If Dragon Army comes knocking, we use the tunnel and extract. We're here 
for research, not confrontation. Keep it simple."
Grimbold nods. "Understood. I'll handle security. You focus on your ancient 
entity problem."
 
EVENING AT WAREHOUSE 47
The party settles in for the night:
*	Comfortable rooms on the third floor
*	Good food (Grimbold arranged supplies)
*	Proper rest before intensive research tomorrow
*	Resonance Network tested and functioning perfectly in urban 
environment
Next morning, you use the tunnel to reach the Library without 
being observed.
 
SKIP TO: GREAT LIBRARY RESEARCH
Would you like me to:
1.	Montage the research - summarize the week of investigation, present 
findings efficiently
2.	Detail key discoveries - show 2-3 important research moments, skip 
the tedious parts
3.	Fast resolution - here's what you learned, here's the solution, move to 
implementation
Which approach do you prefer for the research phase?
The goal is getting you the information needed to re-seal the primordial 
fragment without getting bogged down in political storylines or extensive RP 
scenes.

7:06 AM
RESEARCH PHASE - FAST RESOLUTION
Over the next seven days, Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa work intensively in the 
Great Library's restricted archives with Master Aldric's guidance. Long hours 
of ancient texts, pre-Cataclysm records, and dangerous knowledge yield 
results.
 
WHAT YOU LEARNED:
THE ENTITY - IDENTIFIED:
The primordial fragment beneath Xak Tsaroth is called an "Unbound" - a 
piece of raw elemental chaos from before divine shaping. Specifically, this one 
is a water-aspected chaos fragment (explains the blue-green light, the 
affinity for the flooded excavation).
*	Nature: Pre-divine, non-sentient, reactive rather than proactive
*	Behavior: Feeds on psychic energy (memories, emotions, 
consciousness)
*	Dormancy: After feeding, enters dormant state until disturbed
*	Threat Level: If fully active, could devastate a 50-mile radius by 
unmaking reality's structure
*	Current Status: Dormant after feeding on Dragon Army casualties, 
stable unless provoked
THE ORIGINAL BINDING:
The Temple of Huerzyd priests used a Threefold Seal:
1.	Physical Seal: Stone barriers inscribed with containment runes (now 
broken by excavation)
2.	Divine Seal: Wards powered by divine authority (weakened when the 
god fell, degraded over 1,000+ years)
3.	Sacrifice Seal: Voluntary binding by a priest who remained as eternal 
guardian (died during Cataclysm, seal broke)
All three seals failed when the Dragon Army breached the chamber and the 
Cataclysm's flooding damaged the already-weakened wards.
THE SOLUTION - RE-SEALING:
You cannot recreate the original Threefold Seal (no fallen god to provide 
divine authority, no priest willing to sacrifice themselves eternally).
BUT: You found an alternative in a treatise on "Emergency Containment 
Protocols for Divine Catastrophes":
The Eternal Tomb Method
Requirements:
1.	Divine Authority: High Priest or Disk Bearer invoking direct divine 
power
2.	Ritual Components: Sanctified stone (from a consecrated temple), 
holy water (blessed by multiple gods), silver chains (representing 
binding)
3.	Physical Collapse: Bury the entity under massive weight of blessed 
stone and earth
4.	Sustained Consecration: Maintain permanent Hallow spell on the 
site
Process:
*	Divine authority casts Hallow on the excavation site (24-hour ritual, 
1,000 gp components)
*	While ritual is active, collapse the excavation using mundane means 
(explosives, structural sabotage)
*	The Hallow effect becomes permanent, binding the entity beneath 
consecrated ground
*	Entity remains dormant, contained by divine authority and physical 
weight
*	Requires annual renewal by a cleric (simple maintenance ritual)
Success Rate: 95% effective for dormant entities, 60% for active ones
Timeline: Must be executed while entity is dormant (current state, but 
unknown duration)
 
MASTER ALDRIC'S ASSESSMENT:
"This is achievable. You need a high-ranking cleric - Goldmoon with the Disks 
would be ideal, or Elistan as High Priest of Paladine. The ritual itself is 
straightforward if expensive. The structural collapse is engineering, not 
magic."
"Recommendation: Return to Haven, brief Commander Laurana, coordinate 
with Goldmoon for the Hallow casting, organize engineering corps to collapse 
the excavation. Execute within two weeks before the entity becomes active 
again."
 
ADDITIONAL DISCOVERY - IMPORTANT WARNING:
In a personal journal from a Temple of Huerzyd priest, you found this entry:
"The Unbound does not forget. Those who freed it from imprisonment - 
intentionally or otherwise - are MARKED. It will recognize their psychic 
signature if encountered again. Approach with caution."
Translation: The entity "remembers" Johannes, Cyrus, and Kessa at some 
fundamental level. If you're present during re-sealing, it may react to your 
presence. Recommend staying at distance while Goldmoon performs the 
ritual.
 
RESEARCH COMPLETE - DAY 7
You have everything needed:
*	Full understanding of the entity's nature
*	Proven re-sealing method
*	List of required components
*	Clear execution plan
*	Warning about personal risk
Master Aldric: "Excellent work. Seven days of intensive research, and you've 
found a viable solution. I'll compile this into a formal report you can take to 
your commanders. This knowledge will be preserved here as well - if similar 
entities are ever discovered, we'll have the protocols."
Total Cost:
*	35 gp for decoy actors (7 days  5 gp/day)
*	Personal expenses (food, lodging, supplies): ~20 gp
*	Research materials (parchment, copying texts): ~15 gp
*	Total: ~70 gp from party funds
 
MISSION STATUS:
? Primordial fragment identified ? Re-sealing method discovered 
? Clear execution plan developed ? Dragon Army surveillance avoided (via 
tunnel and decoys) ? Ready to return to Haven
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA:
You have what you came for. The research is complete.
Do you:
1.	Return to Haven immediately - brief Laurana, organize the re-
sealing operation
2.	Handle anything else in Palanthas first - any other business 
before departing?
3.	Check on Master Keldin - stop in Ak-Thyln on return journey to 
report on Resonance Network field test
What's your priority?
3, then 1
7:08 AM
DEPARTURE FROM PALANTHAS
You thank Master Aldric for his invaluable assistance, settle accounts with 
Grimbold (who's paid through the week plus a generous bonus for excellent 
work), and depart Palanthas using the tunnel exit to avoid any potential 
Dragon Army observation.
The decoy operation worked perfectly - as far as any watchers knew, three 
merchants spent a quiet week conducting business in their warehouse.
 
DAY 10 - ARRIVAL AT AK-THYLN
The journey back takes you through Ak-Thyln. The coastal town is thriving - 
the invasion that never came means prosperity continues.
MASTER KELDIN'S WORKSHOP - AFTERNOON
The dwarf looks up from his workbench as you enter, grinning broadly.
"Back already? How did the Mark I prototypes perform?"
 
RESONANCE NETWORK FIELD TEST REPORT
Johannes provides comprehensive feedback:
SUCCESSES:
*	Silent communication during urban operations (Palanthas)
*	Crystal clear transmission despite city noise and activity
*	1-mile range confirmed multiple times
*	No accidental eavesdropping or interception detected
*	Comfortable to wear for extended periods (7+ days continuous use)
*	No interference from general magical activity
*	Emotional discipline learned quickly - minimal accidental thought 
broadcasting after initial practice
STRENGTHS:
*	Always-on connection invaluable for coordination
*	Subvocal option works perfectly for discrete communication
*	No daily limits or charges needed
*	Lightweight, doesn't interfere with combat or stealth
LIMITATIONS CONFIRMED:
*	Cannot selectively transmit to one wearer (all three receive 
simultaneously)
*	Brief static when passing through areas of heavy ambient magic
*	Requires conscious thought-discipline to avoid broadcasting stray ideas
*	Line of effect requirement means thick stone walls (10+ feet) do block 
signal
RECOMMENDATIONS FOR MARK II:
*	Selective transmission option (choose recipient rather than broadcast to 
all)
*	Slightly extended range (1.5-2 miles would be ideal)
*	Visual indicator when connection is active/inactive
*	Emergency "silent mode" that blocks all transmission temporarily
 
KELDIN'S RESPONSE
He takes notes furiously, nodding and grinning.
"Excellent feedback! Exactly what I needed. The selective transmission - that's 
technically challenging but definitely achievable for Mark II. Visual indicator 
is simple - I can add a tiny crystal that glows when active."
He examines the devices as you return them briefly for inspection.
"No physical damage, crystals still perfectly attuned, enchantments stable. 
These performed flawlessly. You've validated the core design."
He hands them back. "Keep them. They're yours. Mark I is proven technology 
now. When I develop Mark II with improvements, I'll offer you an upgrade, 
but these will serve you well until then."
PROJECT STATUS UPDATE:
"Phase 2 - Image Transmission: Still working on it. The scrying integration is 
proving more complex than anticipated. Current estimate: 8-10 months from 
project start (so 5-7 more months)."
"But based on Mark I's success, I'm confident Phase 2 is achievable. Your field 
test proved the fundamental resonance network is sound. Adding visual 
transmission is just... very complicated engineering."
He walks you to the door. "Thank you. For funding this, for field testing, for 
providing real operational feedback. The Resonance Network will change 
tactical communication across Krynn, and it's happening because you believed 
in it."
 
DEPARTURE FROM AK-THYLN - CONTINUING TO HAVEN
Days 11-15: Travel to Haven
The journey is uneventful. The party uses the Resonance Network constantly 
now - it's become second nature. Quiet communication during travel, 
coordinating watches at camp, warning about potential threats.
Cyrus via Network: "This changes everything. Even without image 
transmission, silent coordination is incredible."
Kessa: "Agreed. Though I still occasionally broadcast thoughts about bad 
trail rations. Sorry about that."
 
DAY 15 - ARRIVAL AT HAVEN
You're immediately escorted to Commander Laurana's command tent. She's 
with Goldmoon and Elistan - clearly, word of your research mission preceded 
you.
DEBRIEFING - THE PRIMORDIAL FRAGMENT
Johannes presents the research findings:
*	Entity identified as water-aspected Unbound
*	Currently dormant after feeding
*	Re-sealing method: Eternal Tomb using Hallow ritual
*	Requirements: High Priest/Disk Bearer, sanctified components, 
structural collapse
*	Timeline: Must execute while entity remains dormant (unknown 
duration, but urgency advised)
*	Warning: Party members are "marked" by entity, should maintain 
distance during re-sealing
GOLDMOON'S RESPONSE:
"A primordial fragment. Pre-divine chaos given form." She touches the satchel 
containing the Disks. "Mishakal confirms this is within my capability. 
The Hallow ritual is demanding but achievable with the Disks' power."
ELISTAN ADDS:
"Paladine can provide additional support. A joint consecration - Mishakal and 
Paladine together - would strengthen the binding significantly."
COMMANDER LAURANA:
"Then we have a plan. I'll organize:
Operation: Eternal Tomb
Objectives:
1.	Transport Goldmoon and Elistan to Xak Tsaroth (5-day journey)
2.	Establish secure perimeter around excavation site
3.	Execute Hallow ritual (24 hours, Goldmoon and Elistan)
4.	Collapse excavation using engineering corps
5.	Confirm entity containment
6.	Establish annual maintenance schedule
Timeline: Depart in 3 days (time to gather components and organize 
engineering support)
Force Commitment:
*	30 soldiers (perimeter security)
*	Engineering corps (10 personnel with excavation equipment)
*	Goldmoon (Disk Bearer, primary ritualist)
*	Elistan (High Priest of Paladine, supporting ritualist)
*	Johannes, Cyrus, Kessa (optional - maintain distance due to 'marked' 
status, but available as subject matter experts)
She looks at you three. "You've done the hard part - the research, the 
intelligence. The actual re-sealing is clergy work and engineering. Do you want 
to accompany the operation as advisors, or consider this mission complete?"
 
JOHANNES, CYRUS, KESSA - DECISION:
Do you:
1.	Accompany the operation - Be present at Xak Tsaroth for the re-
sealing (maintain distance from entity as warned)
2.	Mission complete - Trust Goldmoon and Elistan to handle it, take 
well-earned rest
3.	Partial participation - Help establish perimeter, then withdraw 
before ritual begins
4.	Something else
What's your choice?
We need to stay away, we aren't really adding anything to the process. Let's 
move onto a new adventure.
7:11 AM
MISSION COMPLETE - STANDING DOWN
"We'll sit this one out," Johannes says. "The research is done. The entity is 
marked to us - our presence could complicate the ritual. Goldmoon and 
Elistan have this."
Commander Laurana nods approvingly. "Professional decision. Know 
when your part is done and let the specialists handle theirs. The operation will 
proceed without you."
Goldmoon: "Your research made this possible. The re-sealing will succeed 
because you invested the time to find the solution. That's contribution 
enough."
 
THREE DAYS LATER - OPERATION ETERNAL TOMB DEPARTS
You watch from Haven as Goldmoon, Elistan, the engineering corps, and 
security detachment depart for Xak Tsaroth.
Two weeks later, word returns via Sending Stone:
"Operation successful. Entity sealed. Hallow ritual complete. Site collapsed 
and consecrated. Annual maintenance established. Zero casualties. Well 
done. - Goldmoon"
The primordial fragment is contained. The threat is neutralized. Your research 
saved potentially thousands of lives.
 
DOWNTIME & NEXT MISSION
Party Status:
*	Level 10, full capabilities
*	Well-funded (~1,480 gp each after expenses)
*	Equipped with Resonance Network Mark I
*	Established reputation as elite operatives
*	Patron tribute due in ~7.5 months
A week after Goldmoon's return, Commander Laurana summons 
you again.
 
COMMANDER LAURANA'S OFFICE
She has that look - the one that means she has something difficult and 
important.
"Welcome back. The Xak Tsaroth situation is resolved thanks to your research. 
But we have new developments. Multiple fronts, as always."
She spreads a map on the table.
"I have three potential missions for you. All critical. All requiring your 
particular skillset."
 
MISSION OPTION 1: THE SILVANESTI INSERTION
"The elven kingdom of Silvanesti has been occupied by Dragon Army forces 
for months. They've established a nightmarish occupation - twisted magic, 
corrupted forests, the elves are suffering under a dragon named Cyan 
Bloodbane."
"We've received word from elven resistance fighters requesting assistance 
extracting a high-value target: Senator Silvanos, a member of the elven 
ruling council who has intelligence on Dragon Army operations and internal 
resistance coordination."
Objective: Infiltrate occupied Silvanesti, locate Senator Silvanos, extract him 
safely
Complexity: Deep enemy territory, magical corruption, dragon threat, 
extended operation
Danger Level: Very High
Duration: 3-4 weeks
 
MISSION OPTION 2: THE ICEWALL EXPEDITION
"Far to the south, in the Icewall region, we've had reports of a massive Dragon 
Army operation. They're excavating something in the glaciers - possibly 
another pre-Cataclysm site, possibly something else."
"Additionally, there are rumors of Ice Folk tribes being enslaved to work the 
excavation. We need intelligence: what are they digging for, how large is the 
operation, and can it be disrupted?"
Objective: Reconnaissance of Dragon Army glacier excavation, assess threat 
level, sabotage if feasible
Complexity: Extreme environment (arctic), unknown enemy strength, 
potential for another supernatural discovery
Danger Level: High (environmental + combat)
Duration: 3-4 weeks (including travel to remote location)
 
MISSION OPTION 3: THE NERAKA INFILTRATION
"This one is... ambitious. Neraka is the Dragon Army's capital city. Their 
command center. We need intelligence on their strategic planning - 
specifically, we've learned they're organizing a major offensive but don't know 
where or when."
"This would be pure espionage. Infiltrate the city, gather intelligence, extract 
without being discovered. High risk, high reward."
Objective: Infiltrate Neraka, gather strategic intelligence on upcoming 
Dragon Army offensive
Complexity: Extremely hostile environment, heavy security, pure 
infiltration/espionage
Danger Level: Extreme (discovery means likely death)
Duration: 2-3 weeks
 
LAURANA'S ASSESSMENT:
"All three are critical. Silvanesti needs help desperately. The Icewall 
excavation could be another Xak Tsaroth situation. And Neraka intelligence 
could let us preempt their next major offensive."
"You choose. Your track record gives you that authority."
 
JOHANNES - WHICH MISSION?
1.	Silvanesti Insertion (rescue operation, occupied territory, dragon 
threat)
2.	Icewall Expedition (arctic environment, excavation investigation, 
potential supernatural threat)
3.	Neraka Infiltration (pure espionage, extreme danger, strategic 
intelligence)
Which appeals to you?
Honestly? ALL THREE! You pick the order. But let's get a summary and 
inventory update and move this to a new thread.
7:48 AM
EXCELLENT! THREE-MISSION ARC INCOMING
I love the ambition. Let's do all three in sequence - I'll choose the order based 
on logical flow and escalating stakes.
PROPOSED ORDER:
1.	Icewall Expedition (Investigation/Combat focus - similar to Xak 
Tsaroth)
2.	Silvanesti Insertion (Rescue operation with dragon threat - higher 
stakes)
3.	Neraka Infiltration (Espionage finale - highest risk, strategic payoff)
This gives a natural progression from "investigation in hostile environment" 
? "rescue in occupied territory" ? "infiltration of enemy capital."
 
COMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY & INVENTORY UPDATE
I'll compile:
CHARACTER SHEETS (Level 10):
*	Johannes Constantinius (Warlock 9/Fighter 1)
*	Kessa Darrow (Rogue 5/Bard 5)
*	Brother Cyrus (Cleric 10)
CAMPAIGN STATUS:
*	Major accomplishments
*	Key NPCs and relationships
*	Strategic assets (Warehouse 47, Khisanth alliance, etc.)
*	Timeline (patron tribute countdown)
PARTY INVENTORY & FINANCES:
*	Gold on hand
*	Magical items (equipped and available)
*	Consumables
*	Properties/investments
ACTIVE PLOT THREADS:
*	Patron tribute (7.5 months remaining)
*	Resonance Network development (Phase 2 in progress)
*	Dragon Army interest in party identities
*	Ongoing war situation
This will be a clean handoff document for the new thread.
Ready to wrap this thread and start fresh with the Icewall 
Expedition?
There's a weekly limit on messages in Pro?!
7:49 AM
YES - CLAUDE PRO MESSAGE LIMITS
Claude Pro has a message limit that resets weekly (exact number varies 
but it's significant - usually enough for extensive conversations, but long 
campaigns can hit it).
When you're approaching the limit, you'll see warnings. Once hit, you need to 
wait for the weekly reset.
WORKAROUNDS FOR LONG CAMPAIGNS:
1.	Start new chats periodically - What we're doing now. Compile 
summaries and continue in fresh thread.
2.	Use Projects (which you're doing) - Project knowledge persists across 
chats, so context isn't lost.
3.	Be strategic about message usage - Combine multiple 
questions/decisions in one message when possible.
4.	Save critical information - Keep your own notes/summaries as 
backup.
 
FOR THIS CAMPAIGN:
Since we're hitting limits and about to start a three-mission arc, this is the 
PERFECT time to:
1.	Compile comprehensive summary (next message)
2.	Start fresh thread for Icewall Expedition
3.	Reference this thread's summary in new chat
Should I create the final summary document now so you can start 
the new thread with it?
It'll include everything you need: character sheets, inventory, relationships, 
plot threads, mission briefing for Icewall.
Yes, let's do that.

with Resonance Network Mark I, and ready to depart."
 
END OF SUMMARY DOCUMENT
Copy this entire summary to start your new chat thread. All 
essential information preserved for continuity!
Clarification - the world at stake is okay, that request was only after the heavy 
moral consequence of the Flotsam mission.
7:54 AM
CLARIFICATION ACKNOWLEDGED - CORRECTED CAMPAIGN 
TONE
You're right - let me fix that section:
 
CAMPAIGN TONE & THEMES (CORRECTED)
*	High stakes are fine - World-threatening dangers, cosmic 
consequences, epic scope all welcome
*	"Crunchy" tactical challenges - Complex combat, strategic 
problem-solving, exploration emphasized
*	Avoid excessive moral weight on player - After Flotsam (547 
deaths weighted heavily on Cyrus), avoid putting that kind of personal 
moral burden on Johannes
*	Consequences matter but focus on tactical/strategic - Actions 
have results, but frame them as operational outcomes rather than 
personal guilt
*	"Malicious compliance" as recurring theme - Patron 
management, working within constraints cleverly
*	Divine intervention possible but earned - Dargaard Keep 
judgment showed this works well
*	Prefer combat/exploration over political intrigue/heavy RP - 
Player preference noted
Examples of Good Fit:
*	Primordial fragments threatening regions (big stakes, tactical solutions)
*	Dragon battles, dungeon delves, supernatural threats
*	Strategic sabotage operations (Xak Tsaroth pumps)
*	Curse-breaking with clear objectives (Dargaard Keep)
Examples to Avoid:
*	Heavy political intrigue plotlines
*	Extended social manipulation scenarios
*	Moral dilemmas that put weight on player character personally
*	Situations where "correct" choice requires extensive RP
 
This correction should be included in your transfer document. The 
world CAN be at stake - just frame consequences as 
tactical/strategic rather than personal moral weight.
Ready to start the new thread with this corrected understanding?
No. Moral weight is totally okay; I just needed a break after that specific 
mission for the next one. We can get back on that train...and RP is totally fine 
(see the Dargaard mission).
7:55 AM
FINAL CLARIFICATION - CORRECTED CAMPAIGN TONE
Got it! Let me fix this properly:
 
CAMPAIGN TONE & THEMES (FINAL CORRECT 
VERSION)
*	High stakes welcome - World-threatening dangers, cosmic 
consequences, epic scope
*	Tactical complexity valued - Combat, strategic problem-solving, 
dungeon delving
*	Moral weight is fine - Consequences matter, difficult choices 
appreciated
*	RP is valued when purposeful - Dargaard Keep (Soth/Korinthe 
dialogue) worked great
*	"Malicious compliance" as recurring theme - Patron 
management, working within constraints
*	Divine intervention earned through action - Not handed freely 
but achievable
What Actually Needed Break:
*	After Flotsam's heavy moral weight (547 deaths), the very next 
mission being another morally heavy situation would have been too 
much
*	But now (several missions later), moral complexity is back on the table
Player Preferences - ACTUAL:
*	Enjoys: Tactical combat, exploration, meaningful RP (Soth 
conversation), moral complexity, strategic operations
*	Dislikes: Extended political intrigue specifically (not RP in general), 
missions that are purely social manipulation without clear objectives
Good Examples:
*	Dargaard Keep (RP with Soth/Korinthe to break curse - clear goal, 
meaningful dialogue)
*	Xak Tsaroth (tactical sabotage with consequences)
*	Flotsam (heavy moral weight of fleet destruction)
Less Good:
*	Palanthas political intrigue subplot (avoided because "not into 
political/RP-heavy stuff" specifically meant politics, not RP generally)
 
THIS is the accurate understanding. Ready for the new thread
