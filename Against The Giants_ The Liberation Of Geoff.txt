The Steading Of The Hill Giant Chief 


Background: Giants have been raiding the lands of men in large 
bands, with giants of different sorts in these marauding groups. 
Death and destruction have been laid heavily upon every place 
these monsters have visited. This has caused great anger in high 
places, for life and property loss means failure of the vows of 
noble rulers to protect the life and goods of each and every 
subject - and possible lean times for the rulers as well as the 
ruled. Therefore, a party of the bravest and most powerful 
adventurers has been assembled and given the charge to punish 
the miscreant giants. These adventurers must deliver a sharp 
check, deal a lesson to the clan of hill giants nearby, or else return 
and put their heads upon the block for the headsman's axe! Yet 
this charge is not as harsh as it may seem, for all have been fully 
equipped with all standard items needed for both wilderness an 
dungeon exploration; and each member of the party has likewise 
been given the finest horse available. Guides are available to help, 
and the leader has a splendid map showing exactly where the 
great timber fortress of the chief of the hill giants in the area is. 
This chief, one Nosnra, is a grossly fat and thoroughly despicable 
creature, sly and vicious, loving ambush and backstabbing. 
Furthermore, the party has been cautioned to expect a secret 
force, some motivational power behind this unusual banding of 
different races of giants. More surprises might be in store . . . 
Finally, the party has been instructed to keep any and all loot they 
chance upon, this to be their reward for the perils they are to face. 
They are to follow any clues discovered if such point towards the 
sinister hand suspected of guiding the rising, butto return at once 
if they should determine exactly the reason or force behind the 
unholy alliance. Some relic of great evil might be at hand. 

CAUTION: Only strong and experienced characters should 
adventure into these areas if the party is but 3 or 4 characters 
strong. The optimum mix for a group is 9 characters of various 
classes, with an average experience level of at least 9th, and 
armed with 2 or 3 magical items each. For a small party the most 
important thing is experience, and even a party of 3 or 4 highly 
experienced 9th level characters can expect a reasonable chance 
of survival if they use their knowledge and cunning to best 
advantage. 

Start: It is assumed that the party has safely arrived at a spot near 
the giants' stronghold-a small cave, well hidden, where they can 
be assured of being undetected. They come to the place of the 
giants just at dusk. There are no windows visible, but no giants- 
or any other creatures-can be seen about the place, although 
occasional bursts of shouting and laughter can be heard faintly 
from within. Their map warns of two giant guards at the great 
doors to the Steading, but none are there. (If the party comes a 
second time after once entering, there will be guards.) The time 
has come to see what is afoot! 

If the party decides to retire between forays against the Steading, 
they may be assured of relative safety at the hidden cave base 
camp-provided they take moderate precautions not to leave a 
plain trail or be followed to this sanctuary. There are sufficient 
supplies there for several weeks' stay. Each time they return to 
this base camp they may receive experience points benefits, if 
any, accruing to them because of the previous adventure. It may 
likewise be assumed that magic-users have their spell books 
hidden there. 


Notes For The Dungeon Master 

There is considerable information contained herein which is 
descriptive and informative with respect to what the players see 
and do. Note that this does not mean that you, as Dungeon 
Master, must surrender your creativity and become a mere script 
reader. You must supply considerable amounts of additional 
material. You will have to make up certain details of areas. There 
will be actions which are not allowed for here, and you will have to 
judge whetheror notyou will permit them. Finally, you can amend 


and alter monsters and treasures as you see fit, hopefully within 
the parameters of this module, and with an eye towards the whole, 
but to suit your particular players. Morale should not be a factor in 
most giant actions. 

If time permits, the giants will organize traps, ambushes, and last 
ditch defenses against continuing forays into their stronghold. 
You must work up such cases and plans according to existing 
circumstances, but assuming clever advice to the giants. 

If you plan to continue this campaign by using the other modules 
in the series, be certain to keep track of the fate of important 
giants and their allies or captives. The former will generally flee to 
the next higher ranking stronghold, and the latter will be available 
for assistance to some parties. This assumes survival, of course, 
as well as opportunity. Some provision for movement of surviving 
giants is given in the latter scenarios, but you will have to modify 
or augment these groups according to the outcome of previous 
adventuring by your party. This principle will also hold true with 
regard to any additional scenarios which you use if they concern 
any of the creatures connected with this series. Such continuity of 
encounters will certainly tend to make the adventures of the party 
more meaningful and exciting. 


Upper Works: The map shows the huge timber stronghold of the 
local clan of hill giants. All outer walls are of logs of at least 3' 
diameter. Inner walls dividing rooms and the like are about 2' 
thick, and doors are great iron-bound log affairs of 1' 
thickness-single doors being approximately 7' wide and 6' high. 
All inside floors are of stone. Ceiling height varies from about 1 6' 
at the edges to 32' at the center, and there are great blackened 
rafters above which hold up the roof. The Steading is in a nasty 
damp area, where hard rain is a daily occurrence and wet fogs a 
nightly event. All wood in the place is very damp. (Normal fire will 
have only a 2% chance per round of burning or setting the place 
afire, and even magical fires will have only an 8% chance per 
round of the same.) If the party should manage to set the upper 
works of the Steading aflame, they will be forced to wait a week 
before trying to discover a way into the lower (dungeon) level, for 
hot embers will prevent entry before this period of time. Note also 
that ALL loot from the upper works will be lost in such a fire, but 
that all giants from location 1 1 of the upper level will escape to 
safety in the lower level, going to location 26. 

A normal die score is required to open all doors due to their great 
size and weight. Doors will stay open if left that way. Fireplaces 
are indicated, but the locations of cressets and braziers are not. 
Location 22. is an open stockaded yard, while rooms 23 - 25 . are 
an outbuilding which is connected to the main lodge by a huge 
palisade of tree trunks 3' in diameter and 30' tall. 

Giant's Bag Contents: There will be numerous occasions when 
bags and chests will be searched by the party. The contents of 
these containers may be determined randomly by using the table 
hereafter. The number of items in the bag or other container is 
simply determined by rolling five four-sided dice (5 d4) to obtain a 
random number of items between 5 and 20. A roll for each item is 
then made on the CONTENTS TABLE.

Rooms and Areas 

1. ENTRY AND CLOAK ROOM: The place is bare, but there are 
many pegs along the walls, and various items of giant 
outerwear (capes, cloaks, etc.) and bags hang from them. Use 
random bag contents for any opened. Noise could alert A. orB. 
below: 

A. 2 snoring hill giants, supposedly guarding the entrance 
(H.P.: 40, 34). There is a nearly empty keg of ale between 
them. Unless attacked and slain immediately, any molesta 
tion will enable one to alert the other guard at B. There is 1 
chance in 20 that any well-planned scheme to kill them will 
fail, otherwise they can be slain simultaneously and quiet 
maintained. 

B. Steps leading upto the watch tower where another hill giant 
guard (H.P.: 27) is dozing. A flagon which contained mead 
is at his hand. An iron hoop and straight bar hanging on 
ropes from a rafter above will alert the place if struck 
together. The giant wears a belt with a gem-set gold buckle. 
The 6 gems are worth 100 g.p. each. The gold in the buckle 
is worth 100 g.p., but as a piece of jewelry the item has a 
value of 1,400 g.p. 

2. SUB-CHIEF'S ROOM: This place contains a scattering of 
furnishing (hides on the floors, a bear skin on the wall, a chair, 
a stool, a huge chest, and a vast bed mounted with furs). On a 
shelf 9' above the floor are a beaten silver comb set with four 50 
g.p. gems (value 300 g.p.), a copper mirror (200 g.p.), and a 
large gold hair pin with a 500 g.p. pearl (800 g.p. value). Under 
the furs on the bed is a sleeping giantess (HP. 29) who will 
awaken on a 1 in 4 or if a loud noise occurs in the room. The 
chest contains 980 c.p., 320 sp., and 1,500 g.p. 

3. DORMITORY: Here 1 2young giants (H.P.: 26,24,3x21,1 8x 
17, 2 x 16, 14, 13) are rollicking, and beefy smacks, shouts, 
laughter, etc. are easily heard. All these creatures have 
weapons and will fight as ogres. (Note that noise from here will 
be regarded as the "kids" having fun ...) There is no treasure, 
but by wearing the young giants garb, with suitable padding, 
the party could pass as the youngsters if not seen closer than 
20 '. 

4. BARRACKS: 2 soundly sleeping giants (H.P.: 39, 38) can be 
heard snoring among the 10 beds and 10 chests in this room. 
There are items of clothing hanging from walls and a couple of 
torches are smouldering in wall cressets. No treasure is in the 
room, save a small pouch in the first chest searched, which will 
contain 1 1 Op.p. 

5. MAIDS' CHAMBER: 4 giantesses are in this room (H.P.: 34,27, 
24, 23), and there are the usual furnishings about the place. 
Only the nasty old matron (the strongest of the 4) is inclined to 
fight, but she dominates the others. If the matron is slain the 3 


3 



others will not fight, and will even co-operate with the party by 
describing rooms 8., 9., and 10. (the chief's sanctums) and 
telling how to get there safely if they are allowed to have the 
matron's hoard of treasure. In an iron chest under the maton's 
bed are 3 bracelets worth 2,000-8,000 g.p. each, 3,000 g.p. and 
4 potions (extra-healing, hill giant control, healing, poison). 
Note that the maids do not particularly want the potions. 


6. HALL OF THE CHIEF: Numerous interesting things fill this 
place. There are 2 tables, 5 chairs, 2 stools, and rugs, hides, 
and skins on the floors and walls. The tables have pottery 
flagons and platters on them, and pots and kegs are all about 
the place. There are trophies on the walls: heads (dwarven, 
human, and various animals and monsters), skulls, skins, and 
some arms and armor. Directly across from the fireplace are 8 
shields, oneofwhich is+3 magical (butonly adetect magic spell 
will reveal it as such). There is a brass jar on the mantle of the 
fireplace, but it has no value. A skull there is also valueless, but 
inside is a large gem worth 2,000 g.p. - one of the kids was 
playing with it and stuffed it inside the skull and it has been 
forgotten. 

7. CHAMBER OF THECHIEF'S WIFE: She is at 1 1 ,,buttheroom 
has her pet cave bear (H.P.: 35) which acts as a guard and will 
immediately attack any intruder, for it can smell the person at 
the door. The bear makes no noise. There is a bed, small table, 
chair, stool, 2 chests, a coffer, and rugs, hides and the like in 
the chamber. The chests contain only clothing, as she wears 
her jewelry, but hidden in the straw mattress is a leather pouch 
with29gemsin it: 1 5,000 g.p., 3 1,000 g.p., 4 500 g.p., 8100 g.p., 
5 50 g.p., and 8 1 0 g.p. value. 

8. CHIEF'S CHAMBER: This room is hung with rugs and skins 
and there are hides on the floor. There is a bed, 2 chairs, a small 
table with a tun of cheap wine on it, an old shield and some of 
the chief's weapons (in the corner), a chest with his clothing, 
and other clothing hanging on pegs. A thick chain (for his cave 
bear) is set into one wall. Nothing of value is in the place. 

9. ARMS ROOM: This is the location of the better trophies and 
personal armor, shields, and arms of the chief. There are also 4 
huge fur capes. Although there is no real value to most of the 
items herein, there are 5 javelins of lightning wrapped in an old 
rag which is stuffed under a cloak thrown into a far corner and 
shielded from sight by 3 spears and a club leaned against the 
wall in front of it. Of the other dozen or two items in the place, 
only one of the capes, a giant otter fur (2,000 g.p. value), has 
any worth to the party. 


10. SMALL DINING ROOM: This room is also used for the 
council meetings of the chief. It contains a long table, a great 
chair, a lesser chair, and 6 stools. There are several shelves, a 
smaller table and chair, and some miscellaneous items (a mug, 
some paper scraps, and old knife, a rock paperweight, etc.). 
There are hides on the walls and floor. The secret door to 10A. 
is merely a hidden door concealed behind a manticore hide 
hung on the wall. A rough skin map of the area, showing past 
and planned raids, hangs on the wall opposite the fireplace. 

10A. Several scroll tubes are concealed in this room, undera 
stack of logs in the alcove to the northwest. Only one 
tube has anything in it, this one being sealed and 
marked with a triangle containing a Y. Inside is a set of 
instructions on the next raid, written in giantish, and 
signed "Eclavdra". Also in the tube are the plans for the 
Steading, but this plan does not show the lower level. 
Note that the steps lead to the secret area of the 
dungeon level. 

1 1 . LONG HALL: This 80'long passageway is dim, shadowy, and 
generally deserted and ignored, forall ofthefeasting and fun is 
beyond in the Great Hall. A few torches burn smokily along 
either wall. 


GREAT HALL: This place contains trestle tables, benches, 
stools, etc. To the north of the fire pit (where a whole ox, 2 
sheep, and 4 pigs roast) is a higher table where the chief, his 
wife, the cloud giant, the sub-chief and the 3 stone giants are 
seated. On the wall directly behind the chief is a small ballista 
which he uses as a crossbow (30" range, fires 1/round, 2-18 
vs. man-sized, 4-24 vs. larger creatures). It fires spears, and 
there are 6 there. Barrels and kegs of ale, beer, and mead 
stand here and there. All of the tables are full of various sorts 
of meat, cheese, bread, and drinking containers (horns, 
mugs, cups, etc.). There is singing, talking, laughing, 
shouting, arguing, wrestling, joking, and the like going on, so 
the place is a veritable din of noise. The following creatures 
are in the hall: 


Chief Nosnra & wife: 

Sub-chief: 
Cloud giant: 
3 Stone giants: 
22 Hill giants: 

8 Ogres: 
Cave bear: 


H.P.: 65, 41 (he fights as a frost 

giant, she as a male hill giant) 

H.P.: 49 

H.P.: 63 

H.P.: 51,48, 43 

H.P.: 44, 3 x 40, 39, 5 x 38, 5 x 37, 
3 x 36, 33, 30, 2 x 27 
H.P.: 31,29, 3 x 28, 27, 26, 20 
(beneath chief's table) H.P.: 43 


Each giant wears 1 to 4 pieces of jewelry worth 200-1,200 
g.p. each. Ogres wear but half that amount worth 200-800 g.p. 
each. The sub-chief will have 4 pieces. The chief and his wife 
also wear 4 pieces of jewelry, each worth 1,000-8,000 g.p. The 
chief's pet bear has a jewel studded collar with 6 rubies worth 
1,000 g.p. 

Note that various servants and ore slaves will be entering the 
Great Hall from the west. 

12. ARSENAL ROOM: There are 30 helmets, 26 shields, 22 
spears, 9 clubs, and 3 great axes around the place. None of 
these are of use to the party. 

13. WEAPONS ROOM: Spears, shields, clubs, and axes are 
abundant here - no fewer than 1 2 of each, all sized for giants, 
of course. There are 4 great swords (two-handed with respect 
to man-sized creatures), 2 huge iron maces, and a sheaf of 6' 
long spears the giants use for javelins. All shields are against 
the walls, and behind the 7th one checked will be found a 
magic war hammer +2. One other hammer is out of sight in a 
corner, and it is seen by close inspection. This weapon has a 
magic mouth spell placed on it to speak to a dwarf: "Here's a 
kiss for you, runt!" so until it has spoken it will radiate magic 
very strongly. 

14. MAIN GUEST CHAMBER: The cloud giant and the 3 stone 
giants (now at 11.) are lodged here. There are 6 beds, 4 chairs, 

4 stools, 7 chests, and two tables in the room. Various skins 
and hides cover the floors, several hang on the walls, and 
there are giant garments on several pegs. All found are 
worthless, as are the contents of all chests and the 4 bags 
tucked under the beds. One torch burns smokily at the west 
end of the room in a wall sconce; at the other end is what 
appears to be an unlit torch, but it is actually a giant slaying 
sword belonging to the cloud giant, and if it is touched the 
special illusion is dispelled. Note that the sword is unique, 
with 1 4 intelligence, 8 ego, and speaking hill, stone, and frost 
giant languages in addition to the common tongue and the 
language of Neutral Good (which alignmentthe weapon is). It 
detects enemies, but the sword has no other powers. It is +2 in 
general and +4 versus any sort of giant (scoring that plus in 
damage, of course). 

15. COMMON ROOM: The place has 10cots, 10 boxes, 4stools, 1 
table, 2 benches, and various odds and ends-all of which are 
of absolutely no value. 


4 




16. COMMON ROOM: This place is almost identical to 1 5. above, 
with a few cloaks, some hides on the floors and walls, etc. A 
small chest on a stool in the northeast corner of the room 
contains some dwarven and elven ears, and one of them has 
an earring in it with a 100 g.p. gem. 


which will spare their lives and set them free. These ores know 
about the rebellion in the dungeons, and they will tell the 
party that any ores they see there should be hailed as friends. 
Otherwise, they know only the kitchen area and the Great 
Hall. 


17. KITCHEN: This is a typical giant kitchen with counters along 
the walls, several tables, benches, a stool or two, and various 
items for cooking and baking (pots, kettles, bowls, knives, 
forks, spoons, ladles, spits, and so forth). There are 29 ore 
slaves about the place who will run away from any strong 
looking party. The 5 giantess serving maids and 1 1 young 
ogre servants will also run, but they will call for help. (Assume 
all creatures herein have absolutely average hit points, the 
ogres having but 1 2 due to their age.) There is nothing of 
value. (See 18. below for further details of the items about the 
place.) 

1 8. KITCHEN WORKROOM: This is also a ready storage area 
and eating place for servants. There are 3 tables, a long 
counter, stools, benches, and kitchen gear about. There are 
numerous sacks, boxes, and barrels containing flour, dried 
meat, dried fruit, honey, etc. Various cheeses, smoked meats, 
and sausages hang from the rafters. There are several casks 
and tuns of ale, beer, mead, and wine. Loaves of bread are 
stacked on one table. 


21. OGRE QUARTERS: The hill giants employ ogres for scouts, 
messengers, servants, and the like, for the ogres are trusty 
flunkies as well as hard workers and fighters. In addition to 
those in the Great Hall and the young at work in the kitchen 
area, there are 5 of them here (H.P.: 26,23,18,16,15) playing 
at knucklebones and drinking small beer. Amidstthe heaps of 
skins on which they sleep (there are 22 such heaps) is hidden 
a leather sack (heap 1 5) containing a potion of storm giant 
strength and a delusion potion. Locked in a great iron chest 
with the key held by the strongest ogre (now at 11.) are 955 
s.p., 705 g.p., and 79 p.p. The strongest ogre in the room 
wears a 1,000 g.p. gem on a thong around his neck. The 
creatures have 381 c.p. as stakes for which they are playing. 
Noise from this place will attract no attention whatsoever. 

22. OPEN COMPOUND: 1 4 dire wolves run free here (H.P.: 25,23 
22, 2 x 10, 19, 3 x 18, 2 x 17, 15, 13, 12), and they will 
immediately attack any non-giant or non-ogre entering their 
area. Note that if they see the whip (room 19.), however, they 
cower and make no sound, but otherwise they howl and bite! 


1 8 A. This is a storage room with more provisions as above, as 
well as the stairs leading to the lower level. 

19. SERVANTS' QUARTERS: This large common room has 
various sizes of cots, tables, chairs, stools, and the like. It is 
cluttered with old clothing and junk. In it are 6 giantess maids 
(non-combatants) and a "handsome" giant warrior (H.P.: 43) 
who will immediately do battle in order to show off for his 
admirers. He will not raise a cry for help unless brought to 
50% or less of his hit point strength. On the round this 
happens, he will raise help by shouting with a 60% chance 
each round of being heard. (This giant is the dire wolf 
keeper-see 22-and he has a whip hanging beside the door 
to the east. The whip need only be shown to the wolves to 
make them cower and fall back.) 

20. ORC SLAVE QUARTERS: This hall is a messy and smelly 
place filled with pallets and junk. All but 2 of the slaves are 
working elsewhere, the 2 in this place being too injured (since 
giant kicks break bones) to labor. They will happily aid a party 


23. GUARD ROOM: There is a huge horn to wind to call the dire 
wolves. It rests upon the small table in the center of the room. 
There are 8 stools and 2 benches along the walls. A sheaf of 1 8 
spears is by the door. A line of 7 giant-sized shields and 4 
clubs stands along the south wall. No creatures are in the 
room. 

24. BARRACKS ROOM: This room contains 1 0 beds, 1 0 chests, 

1 0 stools, 2 tables, 1 bench, and miscellaneous junk. There 
are a few hides on floors and walls. Several broken weapons 
and dented helmets are strewn about. The place is deserted. 

25. BARRACKS ROOM: Identical in contents to 24 above. 

A. This alcove off the barracks belongs to the sergeant of the 
guards who is now away feasting. There are 3 chests in his 
area, all filled with clothing and equipment for the troops 
and himself. A sack on the wall holds giant-sized boots, 
and one at the bottom holds 1,300 g.p. and 8 100 g.p. value 
gems. Another sack under his cot has nothing but old 
helmets in it.

KEY TO THE DUNGEON LEVEL 

Note Regarding the Dungeon: It will be evident from merely 
descending the stairs and observing the walls that the masonry 
work is quite good, certainly superior to orcish work, except in a 
few places. The observant party will note that most of the 
stonework is old, even that which bears recent chisel marks or is 
patched with new mortar and shored up with newly hewn stone. 
Passageway ceilings are arched and buttressed every 10', with the 
peak of the arch about 1 7' overhead. Ceiling height in most 
smallish rooms in the dungeon is 20' or so, again arched and 
buttressed. In the large rooms and chambers the ceilings are 30' 
high. The overhead in the natural cavern area (19-21.) is of 
varying height, passages about 10', and large areas about 20' or 
more. The roof of cavern 23. is about 40' high. All natural cave 
areas have stalagmites. 

Wandering Monsters: 

All Non-Natural Areas: Encounter 1 in 1 2 

1.4 ogres (H.P.: 23, 22, 20, 27) seeking some ores 

2. The Keeper (see 2. below) and his pet out inspecting 

3. 1 2 ores (H.P.: 9, 8, 7 x 7, 6, 5, 4) with 2 heavy crossbows (2 

poisoned bolts-see "B" below) out raiding for food 

Other Areas: Encounter 1 in 20 

In 19.-20.: 1 -4 Subterranean lizards (from 21. below) 

In 21: 1 -3 carrion crawlers coming up from the sink holes 
Rooms and Areas: 

"B": Boulder wall and orcish strong point (see 19). 

"G": Posts for rebel ore guards. 

"W": Watch points for bugbear guards. 

1 . MARSHALLING AREA: This room is primarily meant as 
the place where slaves are rounded up and sent about 
their tasks under guard. It is also used for the revels of the 
other dungeon crew when off duty. There are a few 
smoky torches burning along the walls. The benches 
and tables are pushed out of the way against the walls, 
revealing a floor of blackish stone, much worn by the 
tread of countless feet. 

2. CHAMBER OF THE KEEPER: The Keeper is a ghastly hill 
giant, hunchbacked, twisted, and with but one good eye. 
He is throughly wicked and evil, strong (H.P.: 49), and 
remorseless. He is never without one of his 2 pet 
carnivorous apes (H.P.: 29, 26), and both are in his lair, 
one guarding to the north of the door, the other on a 
platform built above it! The Keeper has a chain shirt which 
makes him AC 3, and he fights with a battle axe +3 (+3 to 
hit, +3 hit points of damage). His room has many skins on 
the floor, a bed, table, chair, 2 boxes, several crates and 
barrels, 1 chest, and odds and ends of armor, weapons, 
furniture, tableware, and so forth. None has any value. A 
loose stone in the floor hides his treasure: 5,400 g.p., 5 500 
g.p. gems, 4 100 g.p. gems, and a large earthenware jug 
which holds 4 potions of water breathing. 

3. CELL BLOCK: In the outer guard room are 2 bugbear 
guards (H.P.: 17, 14) armed with morningstars. If not 
engaged immediately, they will raise an alarm by striking 
a large brass gong near the door. If they are prevented 
from doing this, and are faced by an obviously superior 
enemy, they will direct the opponents to cell iv. (see 
below), and when the party is occupied the bugbears will 
smite the alarm and flee. The room contains a table, 2 
stools, torches, and keys to cells i, ii, iii, and v. 

In the cells are: 

i. 1 human prisoner, a merchant, now quite insane. 

ii. 1 human prisoner, an engineer, kept alive to help with 
the excavation of new areas of the dungeon. He 
cannot aid his rescuers, but he will take service. 


iii. An elf fighter/magic-user (5/8 levels but no spells and 
wounded from torture-31 hit points now 14) chained 
to the wall. He has 1 7 strength, 1 7 intelligence, 1 4 
wisdom, 16 dexterity, 15 constitution, and 11 
charisma. He will serve with any character of good 
alignment for 1 year after rescue without pay in 
gratitude for his freedom. 

iv. TRAP: 3 skeletons, each wearing a brass ring with a 
glass gem. The bugbear guards will claim that they 
have been instructed to keep these skeletons safe, as 
there is something magical about them. They have no 
key to the cell to back up their tale, but the lock can be 
forced with ease. As soon as the cell door is opened, 
the 3 skeletons spring to attack with swords previous 
ly covered from view by dust and dirt. Each skeleton 
takes 8 HP. 

v. Large cell with 5 captured ore rebels. 3 others of their 
number have already been tortured to death and 
eaten, so they will be very willing to help any creature 
promising them escape from the toils of the giants. 
These ores will lead the party to 19. if they wish, and 
will see them safely past the guards behind "B" if they 
can handle the bugbear at "W" to the west of that place. 

4.-8. BUGBEAR QUARTERS COMPLEX: Each of these areas 
will have a few torches and braziers burning. There will be 
a few hides and skins on the walls and floors, straw and 
similar litter mounded for bedding, a few stools and small 
crates, boxes, and the like for (worthless) personal 
belongings, and tables with scraps of food and odds and 
ends of eating utensils upon them. 

4.12 bugbears at ready (H.P.: 20, 4 x 15, 6 x 14). Each 
has a spear and morningstar, the former for hurling. 
They have 2-8 g.p. each. 

5.1 2 bugbears asleep. These monsters are identical in all 
respects to those described in 4. above. 

6. 1 2 bugbears as in 5. above. 

7. Chamber of the bugbear captain: 5 bugbears (H.P.: 
24, 4 x 19), the captain and 4 lieutenants, are sitting 
around a crude table drinking ale and discussing a 
plan to wipe out the ores in area 19. The captain attacks 
as an ogre and is equal to AC 4, doing +2 on damage 
and having a +1 chance to hit. All these bugbears have 
bastard swords. The lieutenants have 20-80 g.p. each. 
The captain has that plus 31 10 g.p. gems, the latter 
hidden in a pouch under his armor. 

8. 6 bugbear guards: These alert fellows are readying for 
an attack. One always is at the south exit watching "B" 
to the east. They are armed with hand axes and 
morningstars (HP.: 21,3x17, 16, 13). 

9.-11. SLAVES' QUARTERS (GOOD BEHAVIOR AREA): These 
areas have a few smoky torches on the walls and moldy 
straw strewn on the floor. Some benches are built into the 
walls. Each door is barred from the outside with a heavy 
iron rod. 

9. 24 unarmed ore slaves, very poor morale. 

10. 30 unarmed ore slaves, very poor morale. 

11. 24 unarmed ore slaves, very poor morale. 

12.-14. SLAVES QUARTERS (UNRULY): Note positions ¥ have 
1 bugbear (H.P.: 16) each hand axe and morningstar 
armed, constantly alert and watching. Each area is 
secured by a barred gate through which the bugbears can 
see. Each set of bars is secured by lock and chain as well 
as bolt. The chambers are unlit, have only scanty straw, 
and are quite noisome with ore odor. 


6 



1 2. 48 unarmed ore laborers, fair morale. 

13. 24 unarmed ore laborers, fair morale. 

14. 16 unarmed ore laborers, highly anxious to attack 

their captors, good morale. 

1 5. TORTURE CHAMBER: This large area contains various 
implements fortorturing prisoners large and small. There 
are an iron maiden, 2 racks, thumbscrews, iron boots, 
chains, whips, branding irons, strappadoes, etc. A fire put in 
the center of the room gives it all a hellish light. There are 2 
dozing hill giants (HP.: 39, 36) behind the large rack to the 
north, one with a gold chain set with a fire opal (2,000 g.p. 
as jewelry, 1,300 if damaged). 

16. ARMORY AND SMITHY: Here are stacks of giant arms 
and armor, being repaired or fabricated. In the area first 
entered are 1 9 pike-sized spears, 41 6' spears, 1 6 battle 
axes, 9 two-handed swords, and other weapons and 
armor usable only by giants. A bit further on are some 
helmets balanced on shields and propped up by 6 each 
war hammers and maces, and if these are touched the 
whole will fall with aclatterto warn the Armorer and Smith 
of trouble. These two are fire giants (H.P.: 57, 50) who will 
immediately raise a shout and come to fight. They are by 
the forges and bellows in the eastern section of the area. 
There are 7 dwarves chained there, forced to labor 
making weapons. Six of the latter are useless to the party, 
being intent only on immediate escape, but one is an 8th 
level fighter (18/29 strength, 8 intelligence, 11 wisdom, 

1 0 dexterity, 1 7 constitution, 6 charisma; 70 hit points) 
who will serve with the party as long as he gets a treasure 
share equal to his level and a chance to fight giants. The 
fire giants each have a sack filled with 4,000 g.p. 

17. Passage to 17A., blocked by stones: Ores have piled 
finished and rough stones before the door to close it. The 
wooden door itself is bound with moldering bands of 
bronze, and a heavy bronze bolt secures it. The corridor is 
disused, dusty, and reeks disgustingly. 

17A. WEIRD ABANDONED TEMPLE: This room is of 
faintly glowing purplish green stone, carved with 
disturbing shapes and signs which seem to stare out 
from the walls and columns, to shift position when 
the watcher's back is turned. Touching the walls 
makes one chilled, and contact with a pillar causes 
the one touching it to become nauseous. At the far 
west end of the temple is an altar of pale, yellow- 
gray translucent stone. It feels greasy to the touch, 
but it has no effects upon those who touch it. Behind 
this altar is a flight of low, uneven steps which lead 
to an alcove with a concave back wall of purplish- 
black, glassy appearing substance. If any creature 
stands before this wall and gazes upon it for one 
round, a writhing amorphous form of sickly mauves 
and violets will be seen stretching its formless 
members towards the viewer. This sight causes the 
creature seeing it to have a 50% chance of becoming 
insane. If the creature does not go insane, a touch 
upon the curving will cause a scarab of insanity to 
appear upon the altar for the first one so doing, and 
a 5,000 g.p. gem for the next. 

18. VESTRY (?): The visible walls of this place bear faint 
traces of disgusting murals and bas-relief depictions of 
nasty things. A flight of ridged, step-like stones slants 
steeply downwards toward the south, but this way is 
completely blocked by tons of stone blocks and rubble. 

19. NATURAL CAVERN: This place is partofthe large area of 
natural caves and caverns which the ancient builders of 
the dungeon came upon. It is now inhabited by 78 
escaped ore slaves, rebels against the hill giants, for 
whom the place is a sanctuary. (See "G" above.) The ores 
are armed with clubs, axes daggers, and various cast-off 


weapons, although there are 7 crossbows amongstthem. 
There are 3 leader-types(11,10, 9 hit points, fighting as 
gnolls, and doing +1 damage), 1 2 guards with great 
strength (8 hit points each), and 63 others with 5 hit 
points. They obtain food from raids, supplemented by 
fungus found in a subterranean cave which is entered 
through the sink hole in the southwest of the cavern. They 
have an uneasy truce with the troglodytes (see 20, 
hereafter), and trade food to these creatures for water. 
The total of the ores' treasure is 45 g.p., 23 s.p., and 119 
g.p. if approached in a non-hostile manner they will 
become agreeable if fighting against bugbears and/or 
giants is mentioned. 

20. TROGLODYTE CAVERN: A small tribe of trogs' are 
forced to dwell there. There are 20 males (H.P.: 45,2x 14,2 
xl 3,1 2,6x 1 0,9,5x8,7,6), 1 3females(13,3x1 1 ,10,9,8, 
2 x 7, 6, 2 x 5, 4), and 7 young (all 2 hit points each). Being 
trapped between the ores at 1 9 and the lizards at 21 they 
are trying to make do until they can escape. The leader 
has 4 500 g.p. gems, and there are 7 1 00 g.p. and 2 50 g.p. 
gems amongst the other males. They are regarded as holy 
things by the trogs, and any creature touching the gems 
will be savagely attacked. 

21. LIZARDS' LAIR: A mated pair of exceptionally old and 
large subterranean lizards (H.P.: 47, 40) have chosen 
this spot to raise their 4 young (H.P.: 25,22,20,1 9). These 
reptiles occasionally dart forth on forays to hunt and 
devour troglodytes or ores, but their main hunting ground 
is the series of caves beneath their own, the entrance to 
which is through the sink hole at the east edge of their lair. 
(The lizards feed upon the fungus and the fungus eaters.) 
They are without treasure. 

22. PARTIALLY CLEARED PASSAGE TO CISTERN: The 
well-like chamber at the end of the broad passage is filled 
with a deep pool of water. This dark liquid is cool and 
wholesome to drink, and nothing dwells in it. It is an 
emergency water supply fed from several spouting 
springs which come through holes in the wall to the west. 
The pool is 1 4' deep, and at the bottom is a small outlet 
(large enough for a man to pass through) of finished 
stone, obviously man-made if anyone is there to see it. 
This outlet gives a slanting, upwards access to the stream 
which flows through cavern 23. Any creature going down 
the stream will come out about a mile below the Steading 
in a small pond. 



23. CAVERN OF THE CARRION CRAWLERS: All carrion 
crawlers in the whole complex of caves and caverns come 
to this area from time to time to breed. Over the years a 
litter of bones has built up from the prey these creatures 
have dragged here to devour at leisure. All sorts of bones, 
human and otherwise, are heaped and piled here and 
there. Seldom does any other sort of creature venture into 
the place, for any that do usually end up by adding their 
bones to the litter. There are 2 crawlers (H.P.: 1 9,1 6) in the 
northeast finger of the cavern. Every turn there is a 30% 
chance that 1 -3 more of these monsters will appear (dice 
for hit points) from the north or south along the stream or 
by one of the sink holes. There is treasure in the place, but 
it will take 3 persons to search a 10' x 10' square area in 1 
turn. Each area thoroughly checked might discover some 
treasure, but each such area may be searched but once. 
Use the following table to determine what is found.

24. STORAGE ROOM: (This area will house any ogres 
surviving from a burning of the upper level if applicable.) 
The chamber is filled with scattered tools for digging and 
stone masonry. There are shovels, pickaxes, hammers, 
drills, chisels, baskets, and so forth, many sized for giants, 
others for smaller creatures. The door to the north is 
locked with a huge padlock. 

25. WINE CELLAR: The door to this room is also padlocked. 
In addition to several large casks, 1 1 big barrels, and 
some various kegs, there are 13 tuns (5 gallon) of 
exceptional wine stored here. Each has a bung seal with a 
blob of black wax impressed with a death's head. If the 
wine is tasted it is 75% probable that the taster will 
continue to quaff it until in a drunken stupor. (One quart 
will make a giant reel, while a gill will make a human tipsy. 
It is the property of the creatures masterminding the 
attacks by the giants, a gift to the chief for his good 
services, but the party can at best guess at this fact. The 
wine is black, has a slightly earthy smell, and tastes like no 
other such drink.) It has a market value of from 200 to 800 
g.p. per quart. 

26. GALLERY UNDER CLEARANCE: (Note that here, and at 
27., will be the location of giants surviving a burning of the 
upper level of the Steading.) The north face of this area is 
being cleared, and a few tools are in that area. The place is 
otherwise unremarkable and empty. 

27. CHAMBER UNDER CLEARANCE: Another unlit and 
unremarkable place with a few tools left laying around. 


prisoned are thick, and close set, so the manticores 
cannot fire their tail spikes through the gaps; but those 
bars which are to the north are not so closely set. (See 32.) 

31. MINOR TREASURE ROOM: This place is the storage area 
for the excess coinage of the chief. There are 7 chests and 
some empty boxes. The chests contain: 

1. 13,000 c.p. 

2. 27,300s.p.-scything blade trap which inflicts 2-12 h.p. 
damage, chopping off a member on a score of 20. 

3. 7,140 e.p. and a poison potion. 

4. 27 copper ingots each worth 400 c.p. 

5. empty. 

6. 1 1 ivory tusks worth 1,000 g.p. each 

7. 980 gems of 1 g.p. value each-poison needle trap in 
lock, another in (empty) false bottom. 

32. SECRET ROOM: This hidey-hole is provided with spy 
holes for the chief so he can look out upon areas 1. or 29. 
(There are also spy holes at about 5' height which the hill 
giant has never noticed.) There are three levers on the 
west wall of the room; each raises and lowers one of the 
sets of bars which are described at 29. and 30. 



33. THE CHIEFS TREASURE ROOM: The hidden pit with a 
snapclosed trap door cover has 4 iron spikes set into the 
floor 10' below, and each is poisoned. There is a 50% 
chance to fall into the pit, each person passing over the 
area checking-a second line having but a 25% chance of 
falling in if persons in a leading row drop into the trap. The 
room has various items which will immediately be 
noticed: 


28. QUARTERS FOR STONE GIANT MINERS: 3 stonegiants 
(HP.: 47, 44, 39) who are subordinates of the leader in the 
Great Hall above make this their abode. There are piles of 
skins about, 5 cots, several stools, 2 tables, and several 
chests and sacks containing personal gear. These 
monsters are the master miners and engineers for all work 
in the dungeon. There are 14,230 g.p. in the third chest 
opened. 

29. EMPTY CHAMBER: At first glance the whole place will 
appear to be unused, but there will be a faint glint of light 
from the far wall (western). Was that the gleam of light 
reflected from a gem? Entering to see what the glitter was 
will reveal a pile of coffers, one tipped so as to spill its 
contents of (phony) gems and jewelry. The dotted area to 
the east shows the spot where thick iron bars will drop to 
trap intruders. (See 30. and 32.) 

30. PRISON: This area holds 4 insane manticores (H.P.: 51, 

48, 45, 40). These monsters are caged here by Nosnra to 
guard his treasure. They are fed kitchen garbage dumped 
down a chute from above, and the manticores are wild 
with rage at their captivity. They will insanely attack any 
creature if the opportunity presents itself. The dotted 
areas to the north show where bars are (the south line) 
and where others will drop (the north line) after the 
monsters enter chamber 29. The bars which hold them 

8 


Large Chest: 23,840 g.p. 

Iron Box: locked, 4,139 p.p. 

Small Coffer: 41 100 g.p. gems, 1 3 500 g.p. gems, and 
8 1,000 g.p. gems. 

Small Coffer: 1 7 pieces of 500 g.p. jewelry (no gems) 

In addition, there are 3 empty and broken boxes, and in 
the southeast corner what appears to be a broken barrel. 
The latter is an illusion, for it is actually a well-made and 
water tight cask which contains a map showing the 
GLACIAL RIFT OF THE FROST GIANT JARL and an 
obsidian box. In the latter is a chain of weird black metal 
and instructions written in hill giant on a sheet of human 
skin. The instructions show that the chain is a magical 
device which is to be looped into a figure 8. Thus shaped, 
it will transport up to 6 persons in each circle of the figure 
8 to the Glacial Rift if one of their number holds the map. It 
will appear that a large growth of YELLOW MOLD covers 
the southwest corner of the room, but this is another 
illusion hiding the following items hung upon the wall: a 
quiver of 11 magic arrows +2, a magic spear +3, and 2 
flaming swords (#1 : Chaotic alignment of either good or 
neutral, intelligence 10, ego 12, detects gems, including 
kind and number, communicates by empathy; #2: Neutral 
alignment, either good or lawful, 6 intelligence). 

THIS ENDS THE EXPEDITION TO THE STEADING 



The Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl 


Background: Some dozens of leagues to the north and west of the 
STEADING OF THE HILL GIANT CHIEF amidst the tallest 
mountain peaks, is the stronghold of Grugnur, Lord of Frost 
Giants. As frost giants have been amongst those who have been in 
the reaving bands, the party is to deal with them as the hill giants 
have been dealt with. Death and destruction are to be meted out to 
the frost giants in the same measure they gave to the peoples 
below. Those members of the party who have participated in the 
raid upon the STEADING will know that their most important 
mission, however, is to garner intelligence as to what or who is 
behind the unholy alliance of hill, stone, frost, and possibly other 
types of giants as well. Any such information gained is to be 
delivered by the fastest means to the nobles sponsoring the 
expedition, while the party is to follow up clues in order to 
prosecute offenders. Any treasure taken is to be kept by the party; 
this is their reward for the perils they must face-and they are 
bound to face many in the weird ice caves and rocky caverns of 
the Jarl. The evil root is deeply grown here, far worse than among 
the hill giants. 


Start: It is assumed that the party has either followed a map 
obtained at the Steading, or used the magical chain found there, 
to arrive in the neighborhood of the Glacial Rift. If they spend a 
few hours searching the area, they will discover a hidden cave in 
which they can safely hide themselves, their mounts, equipment, 
and even treasure if they take minimum precautions with respect 
to keeping their hiding place secret, i.e. do not lead pursuers to 
the spot, make undue noise there, etc. In any event, the same 
search will also reveal the Rift. The thick arrow indicates the 
beaten path which the giants follow to enter the place. There are 
two icy ledges along either face of the Rift. Both slope slightly 
downward, with occasional high steps which combine to make 
the paths progress from 250' above the bottom of the Rift at their 
beginnings to about 150' above at their far ends to the south. The 
two paths are indicated by slender arrows. The dark outline is the 
Rift, and the openings along it are the entrances to the caves and 
tunnels in its face. Caves and caverns will be from 25' to 45' high, 
tunnels and passages will be from 20' to 30' ceiling height. The 
party may travel on the surface of the glacier-mountain (overthe 
caves shown) to circumvent the whole Rift if they so desire. Ropes 
can be lowered to gain the ledges below-from 50' to about 150' 
depending on position. As the rim and the ledges are covered by 
ice and snow, each turn that the party is moving along them a die 
is to be rolled; 1 in 6 indicates a member of the party has slipped 
an fallen, and there is then a 3 in 6 chance that the character 
falling will continue to slip and slide overthe edge. If the party is 
roped together, when 1 member slips overthe edge, the next must 
be rolled for with a 2 in 6 chance of following. If more than half of 
the party goes overthe edge, all fall. Each member falling to the 
bottom of the Rift takes 1 six-sided die of damage for every 10' 
falling distance, 10 dice maximum due to the cushioning effects 
of snow drifts. 


The whole place is windy and very cold. Visibility atop the Rift is 
about 150'. The wind at the bottom of the Rift is worse still, and 
visibility there is only 30'. The floor of the Rift is a maze of snow 
and ice hillocks and mounds, with peaks of ice and rock thrusting 
up here and there like fangs. Movement through this howling 
maze of cold is reduced to 50% of normal. Due to wind force ana 
eddying currents, levitation orflying there will cause movement in 
a random direction equal to one-half the distance flown or 
levitated. (Use d8 to determine direction, 1=north, 2=northeast, 
3=east, etc.) 


The map the party has shows only the entrance to the Rift, and 
they have no idea as to which path they should follow or what they 
will encounter (other than the certainty of frost giants). Other 
than a few traces of giant footprints, the ice and wind-driven snow 
hide all traces of who or what use the ledges to gain access to the 
caves. The party must learn for themselves what lies in store. 


If the party decides to retire between forays into the Rift, they may 
use their hidden cave as a base if they have seen to its 
provisioning. Of course, magic-users must have their spell books 
in order to regain spells used. When the party does retire to rest 
and recuperate, experience points should be awarded for 
treasure taken out and monsters slain. 



Notes for the Dungeon Master 


There is considerable information contained herein which is 
descriptive and informative with respect to what the players see 
and do. Note that this does not mean that you, the Dungeon 
Master, must surrender your creativity and become a mere script 
reader. You must supply considerable amounts of additional 
material. You will have to make up certain details of areas. There 
will be actions which are not allowed for here, and you will have to 
judge whether or not you will permit them. Finally, you can amend 
and alter monsters and treasures as you see fit, hopefully within 
the parameters of this module, and with an eye towards the 
whole, but to suit your particular players. Morale checks for the 
giants should not normally be made. 

If time permits, the giants will organize traps, ambushes, and last 
ditch defenses against continuing forays into their stronghold. 
You must work up such cases and plans according to existing 
circumstances, but assuming clever advice to the giants. 

If you plan to continue this campaign by using the other modules 
in the series, be certain to keep track of the fate of important 
giants and their allies or captives. The former will generally flee to 
the next higher ranking stronghold, and the latter will be available 
for assistance to some parties. This assumes survival, of course, 
as well as opportunity. Some provision for movement of surviving 
giants is shown, but you will have to modify or augment these 
groups according to the outcome of previous adventuring by your 
party. This principle will also hold true with regard to any 
additional scenarios which you use if they concern any of the 
creatures connected with this series. Such continuity of en 
counters will certainly tend to make the adventures of the party 
more meaningful ana exciting. 

Upper Areas (Caves and Rift Floor): The northern section of caves 
ana caverns is basically formed from ice, with a few areas of rock 
here and there. In these areas a faint greenish light will make 
torches orsimilar lights unnecessary. Fireballs used in such areas 
will make the footing within the area of effect very slippery (slip 
and fall 2 in 6 per 10' moved). For from 2 to 5 turns after such 
magical fire is used, the area will also be filled with a thick fog 
which will reduce visibility to 5'. Boulders blocking movement 
require 3 persons of normal strength to move them, success being 
indicated by a 1 or 2, just as if a resisting door were being opened. 
Characters with 18 strength can move these boulders atone, but a 
1 or 2 on a six-sided die is required for success. If they are co 
operating with other party members to move them, then a 1 is 
added to the probability of success for each 18 strength character 
in the group attempting to move the boulder, i.e. if 2 of the 3 were 
18 strength characters, the boulder is moved 4 in 6. If the party is 
on the floor of the Rift and fleeing from pursuing monsters, any 
change in direction by the party will entitle them to a die roll to 
determine if the monsters continue to follow, with 1 or 2 on a six- 
sided die indicating that pursuit continues, 3 through 6 meaning 
that they have successfully eluded the monsters. This is allowed 
due to the blizzard-like conditions in this area.

KEY TO THE UPPER AREAS 

Wandering Monsters: 

Encounter occurs 1 in 1 2 (d 1 2), checking each turn. 

1.2-5 yeti 

2. 1 -3 frost giants 

3. 4-16 ogres 

4. 2-8 winter wolves 

Note: Wandering monsters are assumed to be creatures not 

shown on the matrices, and their appearance is simply chance, 

although they can reinforce existing monsters in an area if 

circumstances favor this action on their part. 

Encounter Areas et al.: 

b. "b" positions are large boulders. 

1 . GUARDROOM ICE CAVERN: 4frostgiants (H.P.:49,47, 
46, 44) lair in this place at all times to prevent any 
unauthorized use of the south passage. If any combat is 
going against them, one of their number will flee down this 
passage to give the warning of intruders to the guards at 9. 
and 1 0. There are 4 piles of hides, 4 giant sacks, and a pile 
of rocks and ice chunks for hurling. The guards will 
certainly hurl missiles if they are not immediately meleed. 
Their treasure is at 6. See also 2 hereafter. 

2. GUARDROOM ICE CAVE: 3frostgiants (H.P.: 50,42,41) 
on standby guard. If they hear noise from area 1 . they will 
rush there to help, or if they are attacked they will raise a 
cry to bring the guards from 1 . to aid them. There are 4 
piles of sleeping skins, and 2 bags in the cave. Under the 
third pile of skins is a silver belt worth 1,600 g.p., one giant 
wears a jeweled chain on his wrist (3,000 g.p. necklace), 
and one sack holds 4,128 g.p. There is an ample supply of 
boulders and ice blocks at hand for hurling at opponents. 

3. EMPTY ICE CAVE: If loud noise is made herein, the 
ceiling of ice and icicles will collapse, inflicting 3-30 hit 
points of damage on each creature in the cave. 

4. SMALL ICE CAVE: Den of 5 winter wolves-a male, 
female,and3half-grownyoung(H.P.:36,31,1 9,1 8,1 6).If 
the young are molested, the parents will fight at twice 
normal values. They have no treasure, although there is a 
litter of bones and the like in the place. 

5. ICE CAVERN: The giants have frozen 8 corpses of 
mutilated victims, standing them upright in blocks of 
transparent ice. Evidently these are meant to "frighten off" 
any trespassers. The bodies are obviously hacked and 
very dead, not merely frozen whole. Each of these corpses 
has some valuable item with it in the ice: 1) is dwarven with 
a battle axe +1 ,2) is elven with a long case at its feet (cold 
wand with 1 6 charges), 3) is human and wears a jeweled 
belt (worth 7,000 g.p.), 4) is human and has a tube in its 
hand (a scroll of protection from elemental), 5) is 
dwarven and has a spilled pouch of (37 10 g.p. base value) 
gems at its feet, 6) is human and wears a fire resistance 
ring, 7) is half-elven and grasps a sack with a burst seam 
showing silvery coins (471 s.p.), and 8) is a human in 
gleaming armor (magic armor of vulnerability -2 but 
appears as +2 until actually struck in combat). If a fireball 
is used to melt the ice blocks, all magic and jewelry will be 
destroyed. Lesser fires or chipping will cause melting or 
vibrations which have a 10% per block cumulative chance 
of causing the ceiling of ice and icicles to collapse and 
inflict 6-60 hit points of damage on each creature beneath. 

6. ICE PROVISION CAVE: There are various pieces of 
frozen meat, some bales of cloth, piles of hides, and a few 
odd boxes and barrels of foodstuffs here. The third barrel 
moved will reveal a hole with 3,000 g.p., 4 1,000 g.p. base 
value gems, and a cleric spell scroll with 1 cure serious 
wounds on it inside a silver tube worth 300 g.p. 

7. CAVERN: This natural rock cavern is covered with ice 
formations, so that unless the party pays particular 
attention, only the lack of the light which pervades the ice 
caves will make this place different from earlier caves and 
caverns. There are 4 (or more if ogres from the Steading 


survived forthey will also be here) big heaps of furry hides 
near the southeastern end of the place. They cover 4 
ogres (H.P.: 24, 22, 21, 19) who await audience with the 
Jarl. Any noise will awaken them, and they will give the 
alarm to 8. and attempt to give the party the slip and warn 
the giants, too. Each ogre hasfrom 100to400g.p. and 1 -4 
100 g.p. base value gems. 

8. SOUTH CAVERN: Ogre mercenaries serving Jarl 
Grugnur dwell here. There are currently 1 2 ogres (H.P.: 

30, 28, 27, 2 x 26, 24, 3 x 23, 2 x 22, 20) here. All fight 
fiercely. Also in the place are 5 chests, 1 2 sacks, and 3 
barrels, as well as many piles of the usual skins and hides 
used for beds. Chest #2 contains an ear collection, and #4 
holds 1,300c.p.,2,1 1 1 s.p., 792e.p., and 5,300g.p. Sack 
#9 contains 6 pieces of silver jewelry (100 to 600 g.p. value 
each) and 8 pieces of gold jewelry (200 to 800 g.p. value 
each). Barrel #1 contains skulls. Hidden under the 10th 
pile of skins are 2 healing potions and a gold armband 
with an inset ivory and amber bear (jewelry value 2,000 
g.p. - damaged value 700 g.p.). The latter is a pass to the 
Jarl. 

9.-10. CAVERN GUARD COMPLEX: Giants here are always 
alert. The position of each guard is shown by a circled 
number. These guards will co-operate and attempt to set 
up ambushes by the movement of those in area 9. 
eastwards to 10. via the north passage, while those at 10. 
move clockwise into area 9. to come into the rear of 
attacking forces. 

9. 4 frost giants (H.P.: 55, 52, 46, 44). Each has his 
regular weapon plus 1 boulder at hand. There are 
plenty of additional boulders piled near guard 
positions one and four. These giants have no 
treasure. 

10. 4 frost giants (H.P.: 59, 50, 45, 40). Each wears an 
armband exactly as described in 8. above. There are 8 
bags piled into the corner at guard position eight, 
each holding 200 to 1,200 g.p. There is also a rock 
ledge at about 9' height which has a stone box on it; 
inside this box are 6 more armbands and a pouch of 
21 base lOOg.p. value gems. The stone boxwill not be 
seen unless it is actively looked for by a creature within 
5' able to view something that far off the ground. 

1 1 . CAVE OF BONES: This place is the disposal area for 
unwanted bodies and similar refuse which is tossed into 
the place by the various giants in the upper area. 
Although it certainly appears that there might be some 
treasure scattered amongst all the bones, there are only a 
few coins-1 -6 each c.p., s.p., and g.p-and some broken 
weapons, pottery shards, and the like. It takes 1 turn to 
search a 10' square area, and the toads from 12. belowwill 
come into the place to look for expected food when they 
hear noise. Roll each turn, giving a 1 /6 greater chance per 
turn, with a 1 in 6 probability on the first turn. 

12. LOWER BONE CAVE: This place has many bones and 
skulls littering it, and it is the lair of 5 ice toads (H.P.: 37, 

31, 26, 22, 1 9). These creatures feed on the leavings in 
area 1 1 . They have but one treasure, a naturally shaped 
piece of reddish-purple amethyst (base value 5,000 g.p.) 
which resembles a toad. They have it on a protuberance in 
the middle of their cave, and it is worshipped by them as a 
god. The toads rest on small ledges from 8' to 1 2' above 
the cave floor, and they will hop down and savagely attack 
anything which touches it. 

1 3. ICE CAVERN: This place is the home of a band of yeti who 
are scouts for the frost giants. 6 yeti are here (H.P.: 26,25, 
2 x 24, 23, 20) but have no treasure. The leader is at 
location A: 

A. Yeti leader (H.P.: 31) with a neutral magic sword (+3 
frost longsword) with no special intelligence. The 
leader fights with this weapon. He has a hoard of 11 
ivory tusks (400 g.p. weight, 800 g.p. value each) under 
a mound of snow.

14. MISTY ICE CAVE: Escaping hot air from somewhere 
beneath filters into this place, making it full of damp, cold 
fog. The stuff cuts visibility to 3', and the floor is very 
slippery (with a 2 in 6 chance of falling). Check to see if 
the fall causes the fumbling and dropping ofwhateverthe 
party has in hand. Dropped items (which are not too 
large) have a 1 in 4 chance of falling into a crack in the 
floor and dropping somewhere into the bowels of the 
earth, to be forever lost. 

15. ICE CAVE: This is the den of 2 snow leopards (H.P.: 24, 

19) which are the "hunting dogs" and pets of the yeti in 
area 13. These creatures lair on a ledge above the floor of 
the cave, and they will always attack intruders by surprise 
(1 -3) or complete surprise (4-6). They have no treasure. 

16.-19. BARRACKS CAVERN COMPLEX: This area houses the 
band of frost giants currently readying for a raid into the 
lands of mankind and his associates. Each of the sub- 
areas have piles of hides for sleeping, a table and stools, 
and a few extra giant-sized weapons around, but there is 
no treasure except as indicated. All have club, spear, and 
4 boulders to hurl. 

1 6. 4 frost giants (H.P.: 49, 46, 43, 39). 

1 7. 4 frost giants (H.P.: 48, 47, 42, 40). 

18. 6 frost giants (H.P.: 55, 52, 50,3x45). At location "X" 
is a clear spring of water about 2%' deep, at the bottom 
of which are 278 clear rock crystals with a base value 
of 10 g.p. each. 

19. 4 frost giants (H.P.: 51,48, 44, 41). 


have delivered their message and are about to depart for 
their own land. There are 3 huge piles of furs and skins in 
the place, a rude table, a bench, 3 stools, a large brazier, 
and 3 sacks, each with 3,000 g.p. plus the usual contents. 
The strongest fire giant carries a token of the Jarl's fealty 
to King Snurre, a solid silver statue of a bear, rampant, 
with topaz eyes (500 g.p. each) and ruby fangs (8 gems 
worth 500 g.p. each) worth 6,000 g.p. (silver is worth 100 
g.p.). The statue is carried in a bag at his belt. 

27. WINTER WOLF PACK: This wild pack of 7 animals (H.P. 
39, 33, 30, 29, 28, 26, 25) is encouraged to roam the place 
by the frost giants. They have no treasure. 

28. SNOW COVERED DOME OF ICE: This formation has 
been caused by the creature which lairs inside, a 
remorhaz 30' long (H.P.: 58) which has recently moved 
into the rift. A number of skeletons are around its icy den, 
one of a human with a ring of 3 wishes on its bony finger 
and a bastard sword (+2 giant slayer, no special 
intelligence, align to suit the party if desired, otherwise it 
is Lawful Good). If the monster is destroyed by heat 
(fireball, lightning, wall of fire, fire elemental, etc., the 
treasures are lost-destroyed or sunk into the ice non- 
recoverable). 

29. WHITE PUDDING: Note that there are 2 of these 
monsters, 1 at each place 29 is shown on the map. They 
are simply white colored variants of the usual black 
pudding. 1 has 77 hit points, the other 66. 


20. ICE STORAGE CAVE: This place is full of large and small 
pieces of frozen meat, some of the chunks resembling 
parts of human and demi-human bodies. 

21. ICE CAVERN: A rune of warning carved into the ice floor 
clearly shows that this place is to be shunned. (Any party 
member able to speak the language of frost giants, or if a 
comprehend languages spell or the like is available to the 
party, will immediately understand this as a dire warning!) 
Only 10' beyond the west bend of the cavern, the walls 
appear to be covered with old, rough ivory-it is full of 
brown mold. Mounds down the corridor appear to be the 
bony remains of various creatures, but the growth covers 
them, so no positive observation can be made. There is no 
treasure. 

22. GUARD ICE CAVE: 2 frost giants (H.P.: 49, 47), 1 
watching at the cave mouth, 1 steeping on a pile of hides. 
Each is armed, and there are 8 throwing boulders in the 
cave. They each have a sack, but neither have any 
treasure. 

23. GUARD CAVE: 4 frost giants (H.P.: 48,46,44,42). 1 giant 
watches down each passage while the other 2 sleep on 
heaps of skins. Each has his weapon and 4 boulders to 
hurl. There are 4 sacks in the cave but no treasure. 

24. VISITORS' CAVE: 5 hill giants (H.P.: 40,38,37,35,34) are 
camped here awaiting a summons from the Jarl. The cave 
has 5 heaps of hides and 5 giant-sized bags. Bag #4 has a 
gold-inlayed skull with a report from the hill giant leader 
(Chief) to the Jarl inside. It is a pass to the Hall of King 
Snurre, also, and the biggest hill giant knows that they are 
bound south to the realm of the fire giants after seeing the 
Jarl so as to take a message to the fire giant King. Each hill 
giant wears a fur cloak worth 1,000 to 6,000 g.p. 

25. VISITORS' CAVE: 5 stone giants (H.P.: 55, 52, 39,46,42) 
of very large size have come here to pay their respects to 
the Jarl and to see how well the frost giants are doing in 
their war on humankind. They will report their obser 
vations to other stone giants if they get the opportunity. 
They will fight only if attacked. Each has a weapon and 3 
rocks handy. Amongst the 5 piles of skins in the cave is a 
jeweled crown worth 15,000 g.p. (9 gems worth 1,000 g.p. 
each, 2,000 g.p. worth of platinum) which they intend to 
give to the Jarl as a gift if he appears to be doing well. 

26. SPECIAL VISITORS' CAVE: This location is warmed 
somewhat by volcanic activity, and it is lit by dim reddish 
light. In it are 3 fire giant messengers (H.P. :60,58, 5^ who 


30. Ice coated sink hole around 1 2' diameter and 100' deep 
which gives access to level #2, area 2. 



12 




KEY TO THE LOWER AREAS 

Referee's Notes: This area is basically natural formations, with 
some rough-hewn connecting passages and enlargements made 
here and there. Passages are about 25' high, while the roofs of 
small caverns are 30' to 40' high, those of the large ones 45' to 60' 
tall. Light in this area comes from torches and cressets which are 
actually cages for fire beetles, the latter mostly in the part 
inhabited by the Jarl. Survivors of attacks on the level above will 
most likely make a stand in area 1. below or attempt to hide in area 
3 below if weak and hotly pursued. 

Wandering Monsters: 

Encounter occurs 1 in 10 (d 20), check each turn. 

1.4 frost giant guards making the rounds 

2. 3-12 ogres on an errand for the Jarl 

3. 3 frost giantesses and 3 ogre servants out for a walk 

4. 1 frost giant and 2-5 winter wolves searching for possible 
intruders (ONLY IF PARTY IS KNOWN TO BE AROUND) 

Encounter Areas et al.: 

b. "b" positions are large boulders. 

1. GRAND ENTRY CAVERN: This place is obviously meant 
to be impressive, as its walls bear carvings of battle and 
hunting scenes in bas-relief. These carved scenes show 
giants slaying enemies, hunting dragons and other 
fearsome monsters, and so on. Torches burn at intervals 
along its length. Note: the boulder closing the passage to 
the west is well concealed and looks much like the normal 
cavern walls, so treat it as a hidden door. 

2. VAULTED CAVERN: The noise of moving the boulder 
which closes the place off from the rest of the complex 
will awaken the 2 white dragons kept herein. A large 
ancient male (56 hit points) rests atop a heap of treasure: 
72,000 s.p.., 17,320 e.p., 2,966 p.p., 8 silver boxes filled 
with ivory (weight 3,000 g.p. each, value 4,500 g.p. ivory, 

1,500 g.p. each per box), 1 alabaster statue (4,000 g.p. 
value), 7 white marble statues of no great worth, a 
scattering of 1,900 1 g.p. base value gems, 11 pewter 
serving pieces of small worth, 24 various weapons (a 
dagger +2 amongst them), 9 shields, 8 suits of armor 
(including a silvered set of black chainmail +3, 27 urns of 
small value, and 61 bottles and flasks which have no value 
exceptforl which holds poison, 1 which is a potion of fire 
resistance, and another 2 which hold potions of diminu 
tion and polymorph (self). He is directly against the 
portion of rock which splits the entry to the lair into a 
north passage and an east passage, and he will surprise 
intruders on a 3 in 6 basis. His mate (H.P.: 42) is at A. 

A. This location is a ledge with a cave-like recess, the 
whole being about 30' above the floor of the cavern. 
On the ledge a medium-sized, very old female dragon, 
the mate of the ancient male, hides and watches to see 
who enters the place. Frost giants bearing treasure to 
dump on the pile are the only acceptable intruders, for 
all feeding is done personally by the Jarl and his wife 
who bring tender morsels to their pets. The female 
dragon will fly silently to the aid of the male, surprising 
opponents 4 in 6. She hides 1 2 1,000 g.p. base value 
gems (8 opals and 4 diamonds). 

3. STORAGE CAVE: The place contains some remnants of 
carcasses, a few broken boxes with provisions which are 
spoiled, some split sacks containing moldering grain, 
casks of wine turned to vinegar, and stove-in ale barrels. 

4. DESERTED CAVERN: There are broken items of giant 
furniture here and there-tables, benches, stools, chairs. 
Burned out torches are in wall cressets. There are 3 
skeletons of frost giants plainly visible near the center of 
the cavern. 4,000 g.p. are scattered around these bones, 
and a man-sized shield +1 also lies nearby. The monsters 
at B location will attack any creatures. 


A. Frost giant skeleton half buried under stone rubble: 
The clear indication here is that the giant was 
attempting to flee north for escape from the cave-in of 
a passage south (behind the rubble) but he failed to 
make it and was killed by falling rock. One of the giant 
skeletal hands clutches an iron tube with a map which 
shows the GRAND ENTRY CAVERN, area 2, as a 
storage place, area 3., area 4. as the "GREAT HALL OF 
THE JARL", and a passage south (where the rubble is) 
which supposedly leads to various barracks room, the 
Jarl's private chamber, and a treasure room, the 
passage going 60' south and then leading to a complex 
of 10 caves and caverns. Of course, this is a ruse, 
cleverly laid by those who motivate the giants . . . 

B. 6 ice toads (H.P.: 35,31,25, 22,17,16). They are very 
hungry, and if any creatures come near they will seek 
to kill and devour them. 

5. ENTRANCE CAVERN: This is the actual entrance to the 
Jarl's complex. It is always guarded by 2 large frost giants 
(H.P.:62,60)withweaponsand boulders. 1 will fight while 
the other sounds a great iron horn hung on iron chains 
from above. The horn requires 1 full round to reach, and 
another round to wind. No treasure here. 

6. EMISSARIES' CAVERN: 5 ogre-magi (H.P.: 34, 2 x 29, 27, 
26) recently arrived from the Lord of their kind. They have 
had audience with the Jarl, and after a special wassail to 
be held on the morrow they will depart for home with a 
treaty scroll. This scroll is signed (a special mark) by the 
Jarl and offers the Lord of Ogre-Magi 100,000 g.p. value in 
gems, plus whatever loot his minions garner, if they will 
join the war upon mankind in this territory. Each monster 
bears a pouch with 10 500 g.p. gems (tokens from the 
Jarl). A small iron casket holds a gift to the Lord of Ogre- 
Magi-a trick box with 18 plates of platinum (100 g.p. 
value each), 1 Splatesofelectrum (10 g.p. value each), and 
18 plates of silver (2 g.p. value each). They slide in secret 
combination to open a small magical box of holding. 
(Although the container is but ten inches long, by six 
inches wide, by four inches deep, it will hold 3 cubic feet of 
material or 3,000 g.p. weight, whichever is the lesser). The 
box opens by sliding plates on the left, then the top, then 
the right end in platinum, electrum, silver order on each 
end, the reverse on the top. If any plate which slides is 
moved out of order, a tiny poisoned pin will punch 
through the member holding the box (hits any armor class 
on 1 2 or better, -4 on poison saving throw). The box 
contains 2,000 g.p. and 2 potions (frost giant control and 
cloud giant strength). The leader of the group wears a 
necklace of fireball missiles (5 missiles of 7, 2 x 5, and 2 x 
3, hit dice respectively) and he will not hesitate to use it. 
The positions of the ogre-magi are indicated by circled 
numbers. 

7. GUEST CAVERN: A torch lit, tapestried place, with skins 
and hides covering the floor, and a bed heaped with pelts. 
There is a chest, a bag, a table, 2 chairs, and a small 
cabinet here. The cloud giant (H.P.: 70) who is the current 
guest has just agreed to join the Jarl as his chief 
henchman. The chest holds 11,000 g.p., and the giant 
wears a silver belt set with ivory and gems (1 1,000, 2 500, 
4 100, and 1 2 50 g.p. base value gems). 

8. PRISON CAVERN: Several torches light the place dimly. 
A storm giantess (H.P.: 94) who is comely to those of her 
ilk (and is strong and fights as if she were a male) is 
chained on the north wall with huge manacles at wrists 
and ankles. A fur rug in the middle of the place bears a 
table and 2 chairs. Upon the table are heaps of food on 
golden platters (500 p.p. each x 6), insilverbowls(100g.p. 
each x3), and 2 huge flagons of ivory set with gems (6 
gems each, base value 100 g.p.) set to tantalize her into 
submitting to the Jarl's will and becoming his leman.This 
durance vile makes her a friend to any who rescue her, 
although evil characters will cause this aid to be of brief 
duration. 

9. SERVANTS' QUARTERS CAVERN: 1 6 ogres (H.P.: 30,28, 


13 



27,2x25,24,2x21 ,3x19,18,2X17,16,1 4) dwell hereat 
the present time. They each have their own pile of hides 
and rags for sleeping, awooden box for their goods, apeg 
for their outer garments, and a sack. Each ogre has from 1 
to 100 each s.p., e.p. and g.p. in his box or bag. They serve 
the Jarl willingly and fight fiercely. 

10. ANTECAVERN: 4 frost giant guards (HP.: 51,48,44,43) 
are alert here at all times. Each has a club, spear, and 
throwing boulder at hand. They will shout to alert the 
guards to the south if intruders enter their area. They have 
no treasure. 

1 1 . GREAT CAVERN OF THE JARL: This is where all the 
special functions and feasts take place. Various tables 
and benches now line the east and west walls-pushed out 
of the way until a time of need. Caged fire beetles dimly 
illuminate the place, and it appears completely deserted, 
for guard posts A. and B. are more than 30' above the floor 
and hidden in dark shadow. 

A. & B. Each of these ledges holds a watchful frost giant 
(H.P.: 53) armed with a ballista (hits as a frost 
giant, 3-18 h.p. damage vs. man-sized targets 
5-30 vs. larger) which he can fire once per round. 
Each has 4 spear-missiles for his ballista, 2 
boulders, and his club. Neither has any treasure. 

12. AUDIENCE ALCOVE AND THRONE DAIS: A huge ivory 
and bone throne, decorated with skulls, silver, and gems 
rests at the back of the place (6,000 s.p. weight of silver, 40 
10 g.p., 20 50 g.p., 10100 g.p., 5 500 g.p., 31000 g.p. and 1 
5,000 g.p. gems). Behind it is a white dragon hide, and 
before it is the skin of a huge polar bear. An alabaster 
table and 3 ivory stools are to the forefront of the throne, 
the seats of the Jarl's lieutenants. It is unlit and empty 
now. 

13. GUARD AREA: 2 frost giants (H.P.: 56, 52) look east and 
west at all times. They have clubs and 2 boulders each. If 
an intruder is seen, they will sound a large gong on the 
north wall. They have no treasure. 

14. KITCHEN CAVE COMPLEX: 3 fire giantesses (H.P.: 46, 
42, 40) and 4 ogres (H.P.: 25, 22, 20, 1 7) are in the west 
spur roasting a horse over the natural fire pit there and 
otherwise readying the Jarl's food. Various food and 
furniture and utensils are about the main room and the 
east arm. Amidst heaped foodstuffs to the north are 4 
human captives in a cage, being saved for a feast. They 
are not fighters or otherwise useful, nor will they bring 
any ransom, but they can warn the party of what lies in the 
areas 15,16, and 17. 

15. WEAPONS CAVE: Here are stored 62throwing rocks, 1 6 
shields, 29 spears, 1 0 clubs, and 9 helmets, all of frost 
giant size. There are also 9 battle axes which the giants 
can hurl, and a chainmail shirt of giant size. 

1 6. COMMON QUARTERS CAVERN: There are 1 male (H.P.: 
49), 1 2 giantesses (H.P.: 40,39,4 x 38,4 x 35,34,32) and 9 
young (H.P.: 24,21,20,3x19,18,16,14) abouttheplace. 
There are bed pilesofskinsan hides, afewstools, 1 1 large 
boxes, 5 chests, and many pegs with 1 4 capes and 9 bags 
hanging from them. Under the 9th box is a hole with 
19,560 g.p. in it. If the male is killed, the others will not 
fight unless they are also attacked. 

1 7. KENNEL CAVE: The Jarl's hunting pack of 4 huge polar 
bears are kept here. There are 2 males (H.P.:41,39) and 2 
females (H.P.: 36, 33), the males with jeweled collars with 
8 100 g.p. base value gems, the females' collars having 6 
such gems each. Treat these huge animals as cave bears 
for attack purposes. They are very quiet, surprising 4 in 6, 
and will attack immediately. 

18.-19. CAVERNS OF THE CARLS: These large caverns provide 
quarters for the frost giant gentry. There is a cot, chest, 
chair or stool, and several hides and skins for each 
inhabitant. They are lit by torches and a few fire beetles. 


There are many pegs holding cloaks, capes and bags 
along the walls. 4 huge lockers, 3 hampers, and 6 
wardrobes are in various places. Each male giant in the 
place has 2,000 to 8,000 g.p. plus his armband (as 
described in 8. of the upper level). Each female has 1,000 
to 4,000 g.p. The young have no treasure: 

18.9 males (H.P.: 58, 2 x 55, 53, 50, 2x49,48,46) and 1 1 
females (H.P.: 43, 2 x 40, 39, 5 x 38, 36, 33) with 8 
young (H.P.: 24, 2x21 , 3x20,1 8,1 5). 

19.3 males (H.P.: 61,57,52) and 4females (H.P.: 40,37, 
34,32) with 5young (H.P.: 25,22,1 8,1 7,1 4). 

20. JARL'S ANTECAVERN AND TROPHY HALL: The 
western spur of the cavern is a private audience hall, with 
pelts and skins on the walls and floors, a table, and 4 
chairs. On the end wall hang 2 normal shields, a heavy 
crossbow of speed, 2 normal two-handed swords, and a 
pair of huge ivory tusks of no value. Some worthless 
scrolls are on the table. There are 3 chairs and 2 tables in 
the western area, the trophy hall, which has actual rugs 
upon its floor. On the south wall areacave bear pelt, asu- 
monster hide, a wyvern skin, a rack from a giant stag, the 
teeth and claws of an umber hulk, giant scorpion claws, 
the horn of a woolly rhino, a pair of mammoth tusks, a pair 
of mastodon tusks, a normal bow and a quiver with 1 6 
normal arrows, a giant boar head, a griffon skin 2 shields 
(#2 is +2), adwarven skull with an iron crown (no value), 
2 crossed spears and a flail (all normal), a tapestry (worth 
1,875 g.p.), a case of crossbow bolts (11 bolts +2 and 1 4 
normaf bolts), the wings of a giant eagle, a great axe 
(normal), a suit of plate mail (normal) of human size, 2 
walrus tusks (1 is actually an ivory covered iron horn of 
valhalla), a normal shield, a suit of dwarven splint mail 
(normal), a tapestry (worthless), a shedu head, a huge 
iron mace (normal), a giant lynx pelt, the jaws from a 
subterranean lizard, a suit of elven plate mail (+2), a 
normal shield, a light crossbow, and a tapestry (500 g.p. 
value). Note: If the magic shield is taken down itreleasesa 
spear trap which fires straight ahead, hitting on 5 or 
better, and causing 3-18 h.p. of damage; if the walrus 
tusks are touched, the shedu skull will scream "ALARUM! 
ROBBERS!" in frost giant until it is smashed to pieces. 
Some worthless furs and tapestries hang on the short 
north walls. There are several illuminated by caged fire 
beetles There are well-worn steps, each about 3' rise, at 
the eastern end of the place. Thick leathery hides screen 
the cavern from area 21. 

21. JARL'S PRIVATE CAVERN: The forepart of this area is 
filled with a huge table, 4 chairs, 3 wardrobes, 5 chests, 5 
trunks, and 7 coffers. The walls are hung with heavy 
tapestries and various pelts and skins, all of no particular 
worth. The Jarl (H.P.: 80) sits atthe table in his chain jack, 
with a huge shield (+1, +4 vs. missiles) nearby (AC 1 with 
his shield, 2 without), his sword (+4 two-handed) at his 
hip, and a platinum drinking horn set with 8 gems (1,000 
g.p. value each, jewelry value 9,000 g.p.) in his hand. 
Across the table is his "Lady" (H.P.:70), with a cloak of 
sabertooth tiger hide about her, an iron mace at her hip, 
and a gold flagon set with 8 gems (500 g.p. value each, 
jewelry value 6,000 g.p.) in her hand. Grugnur fights as a 
cloud giant with respect to damage (6-36, +4 for the 
sword), she fights as a fire giant in all respects (5-30 hit 
points of damage per successful hit, AC 4). There are 2 
huge winter wolves (H.P.: 40, 37) crouching under the 
table, and these pets will note even invisible intruders due 
to their keen sight, hearing, and sense of smell. All the 
various containers in the room contain clothing and 
useless items except as follows: chest#2 holds3,800 p.p.; 
chest #5 has 15,570 g.p.; box #4 has a covering of old 
socks but underneath them are 8 potions (speed, extra- 
healing, delusion, storm giant strength, poison, oil of 
slipperiness, healing, human control); coffer #2 has 9 
pieces of jewelry (1,000 to 10,000 g.p. value each); coffer 
#6 has a contact poison on it and holds 198 gems (104 50 
g.p., 51 100 g.p., 36 500 g.p., 6 1,000 g.p., and 1 5,000g.p. 
base value). 


14 



The eastern portion of the cavern is partially screened off 
by hangings. There is a huge bed, a small table, a chair, 2 
stools, a chest, a trunk, and various odds and ends of 
clothing, armor, and weapons here and there. The walls 
are hung with pelts and rugs of no worth. The lid of the 
trunk has a secret drawer in it which contains 6 
parchment scrolls in tubes: #1 is worthless, #2 is a curse 
scroll, #3 is a map to the HALL OF THE FIRE GIANT 
KING, #4 is a protection from magic scroll, #5 is a scroll 
of gibberish with explosive runes on it, and #6 is a scroll 
with two spells-9th level spells crystal brittle, which will 
turn any one metal item touched by the magic-user to 
brittle crystalline substance (even something as large as 
and iron golem!); and energy drain, a spell which enables 
the magic user to touch an enemy and drain two life 
energy levels (just as a vampire does). These tubes will be 
taken by the Jarl if he is forced to flee and has time to get 
them. 

A. Behind the wall hangings on the eastern portion of the 
north wall is a hidden escape tunnel. It is a natural 
passage about 1 mile long which turns south and exits 
at the base of the mountain/glacier area, out of sight 
of any near the rift. The alcove to the northwest 
appears empty, but if it is examined with care there is a 


1 in 6 chance per person examining the area that they 
will note a thick iron bar protruding from the wall at 
about 10' above the floor. The bar moves downward 
and transports whatever or whoever is standing on the 
floor of the alcove to a spot some 50' distant from the 
entrance to Snurre's Hall (the Hall of the Fire Giant 
King). An apparently empty ledge along the southwest 
wall is the resting place of an iron box, totally invisible, 
and strongly locked. Unless a special magic (true 
seeing/sight spell, gem of seeing, etc.) is available to 
the party, it is detectable only 1 in 6, with but 1 chance 
for any party, for the magic on the chest is strong and it 
does not radiate any magic or clue. The box contains 
poison gas which will form a cloud 30' per side, and 
any within it must save versus poison at -3 (the 
contents are to be taken to the fire giant's stronghold 
and given as gifts to the powers behind the uprising). 
In the iron box are: a hammer of thunderbolts, a pearl 
of wisdom, a set of 8 small jars of pigments (Nolzur's 
Marvelous Pigments), a ring of Invisibility, and a wand 
of paralyzation. 


THIS ENDS THE EXPEDITION TO THE GLACIAL RIFT OF THE 

JARL. 





Hall of The Fire Giant King 

Background: Just as the trail led from the STEADING OF THE 
HILL GIANT CHIEF to the frozen wastes where was found the 
GLACIAL RIFT OF THE FROST GIANT JARL, so the adventure in 
the latter place has led (or transported) the intrepid party to what 
they hope will be their last challenge. They are about to venture 
into the hot and smoking barrens which are in effect Muspelheim, 
the home of fire giants. In the vast rocky halls of the fire giants' 
doughty liege lord, the dread King Snurre Iron Belly, they hope to 
find both the answer to the riddle of what or who is behind the 
strange alliance of many different types of giants as well as great 
treasure. Surely here in the stronghold of the fire giants will be 
encountered the evil genius-or genii-controlling the uprising 
and planning the well-executed attacks, for Snurre is said to be far 
stronger than smart. It is a sad factthatall encounters here will be 
worse than those the party has faced elsewhere, for fire giants are 
ferocious opponents, and their associates and helpers will 
undoubtedly be proportionately stronger and more fearsome 
than those of the lesser hill and frost giants. Sobering thought 
indeed! However, the rewards for success cannot fail to be 
greater, forthe fire giants-and their masters perhaps?-will have 
more loot to take. If the party has actually been to the other two 
places-or if at least one or more of the characters have-they will 
know that there is a charge upon them to report definite 
information to the rulers who have sent them forth to inflict 
punishment on the rapacious giant raiders. They are to slay fire 
giants and all who associate with them. Failure means death, no 
longer from the nobles, but from the monsters the party must 
face. Success means the right to keep all the loot taken, plus the 
possibility of reward from the rulers of the lands which the giant 
bands warred upon. And now the brave adventurers stand before 
the black and smoking slag hill which holds the Hall of the Fire 
Giant King. They have penetrated near the heart of the matter into 
a fell realm where even the strongest need beware! 



Start: The party might have arrived before the huge obsidian 
valves which bar entrance to the Hall by means of the transporter 
found in the lair of the frost Giant Jarl, and in this case they will 
have to search to find a place of safety to rest and recover their 
strength between forays into the Hall. If the group journeyed 
hence by some other form-horseback, mounted on hippogriffs, 
etc-they will have noted such a place about 2 miles distant from 
Snurre's sooty palace. This hidden refuge will prove to be safe 
from detection as long as the party leaves no plain trail to it, and as 
long as they are notfollowed to it. (Ifthey thrice venture forth from 
the cave to raid the Fire Giant Hall there will be a 10%cumulative 
chance per additional raid that the hideyhole will be found by the 
giants, i.e. a 10% chance the fourth raid, 20% the fifth, etc.). The 
ravine which is near the safe cave leads directly to the spiney, 
broken heap of slag which is indicated as the site of the Hall by 
their map-or obvious to them otherwise, for it has a wide, well- 
trod path leading up to two great slabs of black stone, obsidian 


portals which give access to Snurre's Hall. But these gates will 
open to the party if one of their members has fire giant strength 
(or greater) and mass, or a chime of opening to employ, or one of 
them can cast a knock spell. Each valve is 29' tall, 10' wide, and no 
less than 3' thick. 


The plain about is most evil and drab appearing. The sky is gray 
and filled with sooty clouds. A distant volcano can be seen, and far 
to the south a glowing river of molten lava moves sluggishly down 
a slope and out of sight. It is hot, and the air smells of heated rock 
and metal. The ground is full of cinders and sharp rocks. The 
place is lit by night with dim red light from flaming gases shooting 
forth from the earth and from molten rock. On the second and any 
successive raids upon the place, there is a 50% likelihood thatthe 
gates will be ajar, and some guard will be watching for the 
attackers in order to alert the Hall. 


Notes For The Dungeon Master 

The pile of lava, slag, and jutting black rock which houses the Hall 
of Snurre is a steeply rising hill about 300' high at its summit. It is 
difficult to scale, but the party may do so if they desire. 
Everywhere are vents which smoke, and some of these holes 
spurt out jets of flame from time to time. The party will never 
locate any other entrance into the place, and there is a 2 in 6 
chance that any member investigating a vent hole will be struck 
by flaming gases for 2 hit dice of damage (2d6). 

The upper two levels of Snurre's Hall are lit by torches, braziers, 
natural gas jets, and even molten lava. Most of these lights will be 
extinguished if the place is heavily attacked. The lower level is 
unlighted except where the matrix indicates otherwise. 
Passageways in the Hall are vaulted and some 30' high. Halls, 
chambers and rooms are 40' to 60' high. The floors, walls, and 
ceilings in the place are of black, reddish-black, dark gray, and 
dull brown rock. In some places it has been hewn, but in others it 
appears to have been fused by heat. All doors are made of iron 
plates. Opening them requires giant strength, so normal 
probabilities of opening resisting doors are cut in half. Pillars in 
passageways ana other places are of black stone. 

The lower level is mostly natural, and the details of the place will 
be given hereafter. When the party gains this level, do not be too 
precise in calling direction or distance. As with any such map, the 
twists, turns, and irregularities are very difficult to map anyway, 
and general directions and descriptions will suffice for the 
mapper and make the whole more realistic in any case, for such 
an area would be nearly impossible to accurately map under 
existing conditions. 

As has been said in the previous adventures in this series, while 
considerable detail has been given, it is up to you to fill in any 
needed information and to color the whole and bring itto life. You, 
as Dungeon Master, must continue to improvise and create, for 
your players will certainly desire more descriptions, seek to do 
things not provided for here, and generally do things which are 
not anticipated. The script is here, but you will direct the whole, 
rewrite parts, and sit in final judgement on character's actions. If 
you have already taken your players through the first two 
adventures, you will wish to be particularly mindful of how their 
behavior there will have altered what is shown here on each level 
matrix. Use the parameters given to design your own epic. Be 
disinterested, and be just. This is a very difficult scenario, and the 
players might rue thoughtless actions, but do not allow this to 
temper what you have before you. Likewise, do not set about to 
entrap the party in a hopeless situation-allow their actions to 
dictate their fate. In any event, never reveal too much information 
to players. For example, if they learn about the Drow, give only 
scraps of details from your information sheet; determine a 
percentage probability of the particular bit of knowledge being 
known by whatever means is being employed (sage, commune, 
legend lore, contact other plane, or whatever), and roll the 
percentile dice for each scrap. Base your communication to the 
party upon this, but always judge for yourself if the information 
thus imparted is too much or too little.

KEY TO LEVEL #1 



Remember also that these giants are both the toughest so far 
encountered and that they have the best advice immediately 
available to them. As soon as the party strikes and then retires, the 
attack will be assessed and counter-measures taken. Some notes 
to this effect will be found in the matrices for each level, but you 
will have to design some reactions personally. Even when the 
party first enters the Hall you will have to gauge the reaction of the 
giants if and when they learn that intruders are within. How will 
they react? From whence will they call in guards? Where will 
Snurre go? Most assuredly, he will not remain seated upon his 
throne when an attack is in progress! You have not ceased being a 
Dungeon Master by using this prepared scenario, you have 
simply had some details handled for you so that you can better 
script the more important material. 

When the party retires from the Hall, the fire giants will lay 
whatever traps and ambushes they are able to under the 
circumstances. Lights will be put out, sentries will be posted, and 
so forth. In the play-test version, I had the giants who survived the 
first foray by the (exceptionally strong and well-played) party set 
several ambushes, each surprise being set to allow them to retire 
quickly behind a turn in a passage or through doors, gradually 
falling back on the corridor to the 2nd level. However, even the 
females and young fought, as the King had so ordered, and I 
assumed that their fear of him (and the Drow) was greater than 
their fear of the party-or at least equal. As the characters offered 
no quarter and slew every giant or other creature encountered 
with absolute ruthlessness, their opponents fought with hopeless 
abandon and sacrifice. How you will manage must be based upon 
knowledge only you, as judge and referee, can have. Regardless 
of what your players do, morale checks for the giants and their 
associates should seldom, if ever, be made. What hope have they? 
The rationale of this whole series of adventures is a fight to the 
finish. Only the leaders and those they take with them will 
normally seek to move to a place of safety, the rest will stand fast 
and battle to the end. 

Finally, note that Drow weapons and armor do not radiate magic. 


Wandering Monsters: 

Encounter occurs 1 in 1 2 (dl 2), check each turn. 

1 . 2 fire giant guards 

2. 2 fire giantesses with 1 2 gnoll workers 

3. 4 young fire giants with 1 -4 young hell hounds 

4. 1 cloud, 1 frost, and 1 stone giant visitor looking around 

Note: All wandering monsters are assumed to be creatures not 

accounted for on the matrices. Their appearance is mere chance, 

although they can actually reinforce existing monsters in the area 

if circumstances favor this action on their part. 

Encounter Areas: 

1 . ENTRY PASSAGE: The floor here is polished obsidian, and 
greatwallhangingscanbeseenbythepartyassoonasthey 
enter. The tapestries between the torches are done in bloody 
colors and show victorious fire giants. The door guard is in 
alcove A: 

A. The tapestry hanging before this post is loosely woven so 
as to allow the fire giant (H.P.: 56) in the dark recess to 
clearly see whoever enters. If intruders are spotted, he 
will wind his great bronze horn to warn the Hall. (See 2. 
hereafter.) The fire giant guard has a club as well as 4 
boulders. 

If the party severely defeats the giants in the Hall, a ballista 
(from 10A) will be set up at the far end of the hallway in 
anticipation of a second raid. This weapon will have a trip at 
30' into the passage, and the trip will be nearly invisible 
(notice only 1 in 6, if the party is using lights, and check only 
once for all). The ballista will fire 6 spear missiles, with a 2 
required to nit AC 10, and no adjustments for dexterity are to 
be given. Each missile causes 2 to 1 6 (2d8) hit points of 
damage when it hits. 

2. GRAND HALL: 2 ettins (H.P.: 49, 44) are always here, using 
their four heads to watch all directions. Each is armed with a 
huge morning star of black metal (treat as +1 for both hit 
probability and damage) and a spear. If they throw the latter 
weapon, they will then arm their right hand with the 
morningstar and the left with a mace. If the guard at the gate 
sounds the alarm, these monsters will move to hold the mouth 
of the entryway until help arrives from 3., 18., and/or 21 .-25. 
The floor of the Grand Hall is of reddish black, highly polished 
stone, the pillars are carved into the shapes of dwarves 
straining to hold up the figure atop them, and the light flickers 
weirdly from burning gases spurting from the walls. The 
tapestry on the south wall screens the entrance to the Royal 
Apartment. 

3. THRONE ROOM AND AUDIENCE CHAMBER: 2 steps of white 
veined black marble lead up to this area. The floor is a deep 
red polished stone, the huge stone pillars of polished 
obsidian, between them a massive throne of jet and black and 
white banded onyx, the whole inlaid with sard (1 2 pieces of 
1,000 g.p. value each) and set with 1 2 fire opals (1,000 g.p. 
each) and 1 2 rubies (5,000 g.p. each). The walls are inlaid witn 
colored stone to show various scenes of victory by King 
Snurre over opponents. Behind the throne the wall shows the 
flaming skull which is Snurre's own device, flanked by fire 
giants with clubs over their shoulders. Huge torches burn in 
bronze cressets. (The secret door is actually one of the 
flanking giants inlaid on the wall. A cresset to the left of it is 
pulled down to cause it to swing inward). 4 fire giants (H.P.: 
63,61,59,58) in chain shirts (AC 2) guard the King at all times, 
and their positions are shown by the circled numbers. Each 
has a huge throwing hammer (5-20 hit points damage) and an 
axe. Crouching beside either arm of the throne are 2 large hell 
hounds (7 dice, H.P.: 49, 46) which are the King's constant 
companions. King Snurre (H.P.: 92) himself is seated upon 
the black seat of the throne. He is over 13'tall. Snurre is clad in 
his black iron armor (AC 0), and holds a huge two-handed 


17 


sword which has flames along its blade when it is swung (+4 
to hit, +6 damage). The King fights as a storm giant (hit 
probability and 7-42 h.p. damage) when he is armed with his 
sword, otherwise he fights as a cloud giant. Snurre wears a 
necklace of coral skulls (15,000 g.p. value as jewelry) and has 
a broad girdle set with 66 (100 g.p.) garnets. He is hugely 
muscled and extraordinarily ugly, very broad, with bandy 
legs. His teeth are tusk-like and protruding, almost orange in 
color. Snurre's head beneath his iron helmet is bald, but his 
side whiskers and beard are bright orange and full. Note that he 
is clad in a cloak of white dragon hide which gives him +3 on 
saving throws against cold-based attacks and reduces cold 
damage sustained by 50%. He wears his crown of iron, set 
with 6 base 1,000 g.p. rubies, 6 base 1,000 g.p. diamonds, and a 
huge jacinth (base 10,000 g.p.) only when he is on his throne. 
Otherwise it is in his bag. 


4. CHAMBER OF THE QUEEN'S SERVING MAIDS: The length 
of the hall and chamber proper are covered with hide rugs and 
wall hangings. Note the one which screens the entrance to 
the Queen's private chamber. There are torches on the walls, 
and 6 chairs and 3 small tables along the hallway. At the end 
there are 4 beds, 8 chests, 2 wardrobes, and 4 stools. There 
are always 4 fire giantesses (H.P.: 44,42,40,39) waiting in the 
hallway outside the Queen's chamber, and 4 giantesses (H.P.: 
45, 40, 38, 35) in the end chamber. Each fights fiercely to 
protect the Queen, and those at the end chamber will rush to 
aid the others. They have swords and fight as frost giants with 
respect to hit probability and damage. Each wears 2 to 5 
pieces of jewelry worth 500 to 2,000 g.p. each. Amidst the 81 
hides, pelts, skins, and furs in the end chamber are several of 
value-numbers 1 7,24,40,59 and 77 are worth 1,000to4,000 
g.p. each. There is no other treasure. 

5. QUEEN FRUPY'S CHAMBER: The floors and walls here are 
covered with rich rugs and tapestries (of no great value). The 
place is well lit by torches and a large brazier, and this makes 
it very hot indeed. The Queen (H.P.: 74) is a veritable haradin, 
a sly and cunning horror. She is, if anything, uglier than 
Snurre. Topped by a huge mass of yellow orange hair which 
looks like a fright wig, Queen Frupy's face is a mass of jowls 
and wrinkles, set in the middle of a very large head which sits 
squarely upon her shoulders. Her body is lumpy and gross, 
and her skin is covered with bristles the color of her hair. Her 
little pig eyes, however, are brightwith intelligence unusual in 
a giant. She wears garments of black dragon hide, set with 
iron studs, and this gives her an effective armor class of 2. She 
fights as a normal fire giant male, but she has a bonus of +2 to 
score a hit and a +4 on points of damage she scores. She 
wears 8 pieces of gem set jewelry (2,000 to 5,000 g.p. value 
each). She wields an iron sceptre as a weapon. Out of sight 
are hert/vo pets, a pair of giant weasels (H.P.: 24,1 9) which she 
dotes upon and which obey her every command. 

Any intruders entering the place will be commanded by 
Queen Frupy to kneel in her August Presence and state their 
business, so that she may fairly dispose of their humble 
requests. Any so foolish as to do so will be sorry, as Frupy will 
call forth her pets and herself strike at the most powerful 
appearing of the intruders. She will strike at +4 due to the 
position, do +8 h.p. of damage (5-30 +4 +8, or 17-42!), and a 
score of a natural 20 on the die indicates she has decapitated 
the victim of her attack. She will then bellow for her serving 
maids to come to her aid. 

Her chamber contains a huge bed covered with furs (of only 
100 to 600 g.p. value each, 1 2 total), a small table and 2 chairs, 
a stool and dressing table with a huge silver mirror (value 
1,000 g.p., and it shows invisible or magically changed 
creatures in their real form), an ebony and mother of pearl 
wardrobe (filled with her clothing), an iron chest, 2 bronze 
caskets, a huge chest of 1 2 drawers, and 2 small coffers of 
copper on each table. Each bronze casket has an asp inside; 
#1 holds 4,000 c.p., and #2 has a number of platinum pieces 


covered by a spell so that they will appear as coppers until 
they are taken out of her chamber. The iron chest has a trick 
opening to the side which allows the person to get its 
contents (a jade box worth 5,000 g.p. with a hidden 
compartment which can only be detected by means of X-ray 
vision or true seeing/sight spell-the compartment having a 
scroll with 2 random 7th level spells: cleric, druid, or magic- 
user according to which character first examines it). If the lid 
of the chest is opened, a cloud of fire will englobe all within 10' 
of the chest, doing 6 dice of damage, with no saving throw. All 
but one of the copper coffers contain unguents and the like: 
coffer #3 contains 6 pieces of very fine, gem set gold jewelry 
worth 7,000 to 10,000 g .p. each, and a jeweled pendant with a 
stone which has flashes of color appearing from its inky 
depths (it is a wizard eye device fashioned by the Drow, and 
allows them to see through it). The drawers in the chest 
contain worthless personal articles, except the fifth drawer 
from the bottom there under some underthings Queen Frupy 
has concealed 3 potions- fire giant control (to be used by her 
on the King of course), a delusion potion, and a mammal 
control potion. 

6. CHAMBER OF THE KING'S GUARDS: 4 fire giants (HP.: 63, 
61,59, 58) resting before assuming active duty with Snurre- 
but all sleep lightly. They wear chain shirts (AC 2). There are 4 
cots and four stools in the chamber. Under each cot are 2 
lockers, each containing clothing and 1,000 to 3,000 g.p. Each 
guard carries 1 2 base 100 g.p. gems in a belt pouch, and each 
is armed with throwing hammer (cf. 3.) and sword. A table in 
the center of the room has several platters and flagons on it- 
all worthless-along with a small tun of win and a cheese 
covered with mold (inside the cheese there are 48 100 g.p. 
gems, for it is the repository for the wealth of "on duty" 
guards). There are 1 2 boulders in the entry hall, 6 along either 
wall. 

7. KING SNURRE'S PRIVATE QUARTERS: The great iron 
doors to this place bear the blazon of the flaming skull. 6 hell 
hounds (2 of 6 hit dice, 2 of 5, and 2 of 4; H.P.: 33,30,25,22,1 8, 

1 7) roam the outer hall. The walls here are set with torched 
cressets and draped with crude tapestries. There are 6 chairs 
and 2 benches along the walls, and 3 tables are interspersed, 
each with a keg of ale, beer, or mead and leather or horn 
drinking vessels at hand. 8 normal shields and 8 normal 
swords decorate bare patches on the walls. There is a step up 
just at the pillar of reddish stone which ends the forehall and 
marks the entry to the chamber proper. 

The bedchamber of the King contains a huge bed, a table, a 
small throne of ebony and 3 lesser chairs, a tall cabinet, 4 
trunks, an iron chest at the foot of the bed, and a bench near 
the entry. The floor is covered with pelts, and the walls are 
hung with tapestries (worthless) and trophies: 2 shields, an 
axe, 4 swords, a flail (used to subdue the pyrohydra at 8.) and 
a hammer-all sized for giants and otherwise normal. A ledge 
on the south wall at 9' above the floor holds 39 skulls (human, 
dwarven, elven, giant, and other various and sundry monsters 
and creatures), 8 helmets and helms, and 5 sets of armor (2 
human, 1 dwarven, 2 elven, of chain, splint, or plate as 
desired) of no particular worth. The 8 fur pelts on the bed are 
worth from 1,000 to 4,000 g.p. each. The containers in the 
room hold nothing but the personal gear (clothing, footwear, 
and bits of armor) of King Snurre. On the table are bits of 
carved ivory, some teeth of animals, bits of wood, and some 
stones (1 is 1,000 g.p. base value block of carnelian). 
Together these items serve the king as a divination device- 
quite worthlessly, of course. Flaming jets of gas and a huge 
iron brazier full of glowing coals light the whole place in an 
eerie manner. The secret door to the north is very well 
concealed, and it can be located only 1 in 1 0 by magical 
means, never by such normal means as possessed by an elf, 
for example. (The same is true of the door to 8., but magical 
means locates it 1 in 4, as it is not as well concealed and is only 
1' thick.) A projecting stone to the left of the secret door, 1 2' 
above the floor, is pushed in to cause the 4' thick portal to 
pivot to form an opening 4' wide on either side, and 10' high.

8. CAVE: A 10-headed pyrohydra lurks to either the north (1-3) 
or south (4-6) if it hears any creature coming up the steps to 
its lair. It attacks by surprise 3 in 6 normally. It is very vicious, 
as the King beats it and torments it forfun, and it hopes to take 
revenge on virtually any other living thing. It attacks by biting 
(1-10 h.p./head) on the first attack. It breathes fire for 1 to 10 
hit points of damage/head also. 

9. KING SNURRE'S TREASURE CAVE: (Note that there is a 
chimney up in the southeastern wall.) The cave is filled with 
stuff-a pile of 28,000 c.p., 3 mounds of 4-16 worthless 
tapestries and furs, several dozen bales of valueless cloth, 
scores of various vessels and containers, and urns and vases 
of pewter and brass and bronze (plus 12 of silver and 6 of gold 
worth 200 to 1,200 g.p. each). There are 8 iron trunks, 6 
chests, and 5 large coffers also: 

Trunks are about 7 X 5' X 4' 

Chests are about 5' X 3' X 2'

10. ARSENAL COMPLEX: 2 fire giant guards (H.P.: 60, 57) are 
always at the ready here. If summoned or attacked, they bring 
the chimera at 1 1 ., if they can. Each has a spear, sword, and 3 
throwing rocks at hand. There are torches to provide light and 
a bench in the place. 

A. This wing contains 30 huge swords, 2 ballistae, 44 spears, 

18 throwing hammers, 6 maces, 9 great axes, and a 
quantity of giant-sized throwing boulders. Hidden in the 
far southwestern corner under the spears is a longbow +1 
and a quiver of 20 arrows +1. 

B. This wing contains another supply of stones for use as 
missiles, 11 massive clubs, 17 fire giant helmets, 3 chain 
shirts, and 1 7 studded leather jacks- all armor for giants, 
of course. There are also 1 7 giant-sized shields here; one 
is a shield of missile attraction -2. 8 big barrels of oil are 
stored at the southern end of the place. 

1 1 . CHIMERA PEN: The fire giants keep a large (H.P.: 55) 
chimera here. This creature will attack on sight, as it hates 
everyone except fire giants. It has no treasure. 

12. ADVISORS' CHAMBER: 8 gnoll servants/bodyguards (H.P.: 

15,14,13,2x12,2x11,10) are lounging here, forthey obey 
only the commands of the Advisor or the King or Queen. The 
chamber contains a mixture of small, medium, and large 
furniture. There is a small table, a plush chairwith a footstool, 
and a couch in small size. There is a long table, 2 benches, 2 
chairs, and 1 2 chests sized for man-like creatures. There are 4 
huge chairs, atable, and afootstool sized forgiants. There are 
rugs on the floor, tapestries on the walls, and bronze cressets 
with flaming torches. The chests contain the bedrolls, 
personal gear, and 200 to 800 g.p. treasure of each gnoll - 
chests #3, #8, # 10, and # 1 2 contain bottles of wine and spirits 
and are locked. The Advisor is a grossly fat but very strong 
and quite fast renegade mountain dwarf, one Obmi. He is in 
his spartan study, room A: 

A: Obmi (H.P.: 79; Strength 18/94, Intelligence 18, Wisdom 
18, Dexterity 16, Constitution 17, Charisma 16 (18); 
fighter/thief of level 9/11) is herein at work on the 
problems besetting his King. He has been Snurre's advisor 
for 25 years, spending 5 years as a slave before that. He is 
armed only with a dagger hidden in his boot, hard at work 
on several scrolls on the plain wooden desk in the room. 
There is a case against the north wall which contains 
various maps, scrolls, etc., all written in fire giant or 
dwarvish. He uses a plain wooden box as afootstool, and it 
seemingly holds old clothes of his, but in a false bottom 
are hidden gems whose base values are: 2 5,000 g.p., 8 
1,000 g.p., 23 500 g.p., 41 100 g.p., and 18 50 g.p. Also in the 
cell is a rude wooden pallet he uses to rest on. Note: The 
door to this study appears to be locked from the outside. 
(Obmi is very clever...) He has a peep hole, and if he sees 
intruders who are winning he will yell forthem to help him. 
The dwarf will claim the giants have held him - a prince - 
captive for 10 years, trying to trick information out of him, 
or to subvert his loyalty to dwarfdom, when torture failed. 
He will further claim that several humans in black robes 
aid the giants in their questioning. Finally, he will ask to be 
allowed his armor and weapons in order to gain sweet 
revenge upon Snurre, for he knows exactly where the King 
will be! If worst comes to worst, Obmi will bolt for room B. 
and bar the door. 


B: Obmi's Chamber: Here he has a soft bed, a small stand, a 
table and chair, a cabinet, 2 iron chests, an arming rack, 
and stores of food and ale. His armor+2 and shield +2 are 
laid out on a rack near the door, and his axe +1 and 
hammer +3 are on the wall above. Underneath the armor 
are his gauntlets of ogre power (+6 on h.p. of damage he 
inflicts, +2 on his striking ability). His ring of invisibility is 
on the small stand near his bed. Chest #1 contains 8,493 
.p. Chest #2 holds 904 p.p. and a silver ewer and silver 
owl, each set with 9 base 100 g.p. and 3 base 500 g.p. 
gems (value 3,000 g.p. each as jewelry). Upon entering the 


room he will palm the ring, don the armor, put on the 
auntlets, thong the axe to his belt, heft the hammer, and 
old the shield. At first opportunity he will attack the party 
and raise a hue and cry for help, but he will do so only 
when he knows help will be able to come. He knows a bit 
about the Drow, and he will bargain that, or anything else, 
to save his life. If faced with no quarter to be given, he will 
fight to the very end. 

13. COUNCIL ROOM: The King and his council meet here, but 
the place is now empty. There is a long table and 5 great 
chairs around it. Against one wall is a stepped platform with a 
small chair beside it. There are hides covering parts of the 
polished black floor, and rude tapestries adorn the walls. 
There are several torches in the room, but none are lit. 

A. Alcove: Within is a table with a flat chest upon it. If the 
chest is lifted or moved, 6 poisoned arrows shoot from the 
north wall, striking at the same hit probability as fire giants 
have, and inflicting 2-8 h.p. of damage. The arrows strike 
the south wall and shatter if they miss interposing 
creatures. The chest is locked and full of stones. There is a 
map of the area hanging on the wall. There are large 
chests against both the north and south walls, the 
northern one filled with 8,438 s.p., the southern one with 
4,188 g.p. and 6 bone batons with runes of fire giant upon 
them. Each is a pass saying: "OFFICIAL BUSINESS ON 
BEHALF OF KING SNURRE THE FEARSOME". Both 
chests are locked, of course. 

B. Alcove: 4 extra chairs are stored here, and a huge cabinet 
holds 83 scrolls and 367 pieces of paper or parchment. 
Most are worthless, but the 68th scroll tube contains a set 
of instructions for the King, telling him to gather forces of 
hill, stone, frost, and fire giants, along with whatever 
strength he can raise in ogres, ogre-magi, cloud giants, 
and any other creatures for an all-out attack on the 
provinces to the east and northeast. The scroll promises 
powerful help from "Drow". It is signed "Eclavdra". The 
papers are message copies to and replies from various 
types of giants and others already mentioned above. One 
says: "The fire giant of stone left and left elbow," in 
dwarvish. 

14. DOOR GUARD: 2 fire giants with swords stand guard here at 
all times. Each has 58 hit points. 

15. KITCHEN: The place is typically filled with busy workers: 1 
fire giant matron (H.P.: 60, fights as a male) who is huge and 
fat, 4 fire giantess servants (H.P.: 44, 40, 39, 37) and 1 2 gnoll 
thralls (H.P.: 14,12,3x11,2x10,4x9,8). There are benches, 
counters, a table, several stools, 3 cupboards, various bins 
and barrels, and miscellaneous kitchen gear around the 
place. The area to the east is a natural fire pit, where flaming 
gases are used to roast whole creatures. The circle to the 
northwest indicates where a 6' diameter chute goes down to 
the lava pool on level #2. It is slippery and greasy from 
garbage, and it empties 2' above the lava. The servants and 
gnolls will fight only under the direction of the matron. 

16. STORAGE CHAMBER: This place is jammed full of barrels of 
ale and mead, boxes, sacks, hampers, smoked sides of meat, 
smoked fish, cheeses, sausages, etc. There are smaller boxes 
of salt, and spices (worthless hot peppers) in a copper 
container. There are tuns of wine and casks of beer near the 
door. Heaps of hard bread are everywhere. 

17. GUEST CHAMBER: The doors to this room are closed on the 
outside by agreat bar, as King Snurre does not fully trust the 3 
rakshasas (H.P.: 40, 39, 36) who are the "guests" therein. 
Naturally, the party entering will see the three creatures as 
trusted friends and associates. There are 4 beds, 2 tables, 2 
chairs, 2 stools, 2 wardrobes, 3 chests, and 1 foot stool (in 
reality a chest with an illusion cast upon it), rugs, tapestries, 
and flaming torches in the place. There is no apparent 
treasure in the place, but each rakshasa carries 100to400g.p. 
and 2 to 12 100 g.p. base value gems. The disguised chest 


20 



holds a jeweled sceptre worth 10,000 g.p., 4 potions (extra 
healing, undead control, ESP, and invulnerability), and a 
scroll of 5 cleric spells (detect lie, true seeing, continual 
darkness, cure critical wounds, and symbol of persuasion). 

18. BARRACKS: Currently only 6 fire giants (H.P.: 62,59,57,54, 
53, 50) are housed here. They typically lounge around 
sharpening weapons and telling lies about their amatory 
prowess. There are 8 cots, 8 stools, and 8 hampers in the 
place. Each cot is heaped with skins. The hampers contain 
the giants' personal gear. Pegs on the walls hold their bags 
and cloaks. There are 5 clubs, 3 axes, 6 spears, and 8 shields 
scattered about. The place is lit by flaming gas jets. There is 
no treasure around, but one of the clubs is hollowed out to 
hold the "boys" party fund: 149 p.p., 271 g.p., 160 e.p., 233 
s.p., 184c.p., and 31 100 g.p. gems. 

19. GIANTESS'QUARTERS: 8 fire giantesses (H.P.:45,43,3x41, 
2x40,38). This torchlit chamber has 1 2 cots, 8 stools, 8 boxes, 
a table, a bench, and pegs with various garments and the like. 
Each giantess wears 1 to 3 pieces of silver jewelry worth 100 
to 400 g.p. each, but worth only 1 / 10th value if harmed. 

20. COMMUNAL QUARTERS: 5 giantesses (H.P.: 50, 47, 43,41, 
39) care for 1 5 young giants and giantesses (H.P.: 33, 31, 
2x30,28,27, 2x26,2x25,22,21,19,17,16). All have weapons 
(kids' toys for the youngsters) and will fight. There are 6 cots 
and 1 2 bunks along the walls. In each wing is a bench, 3 
chairs, 6 stools, 1 long table, and various boxes, hampers, and 
cupboards. The only treasure in the place is the giantesses' 
gold jewelry: each wears 1 -3 pieces worth 200-800 g.p. each, 

1 / 10th value if harmed. 

21. ENTRY HALL TO THE KENNELS: 6 young hell hounds (5 
dice; H.P.: 30, 27, 26, 24, 22,21) scuffle and play hereabouts. 
They are part of the pack at 22, and will flee to there by the 
safest route if threatened. 

22. KENNEL CHAMBER: 4 large (7 dice; H.P.: 47,45,42,40), and 

2 medium (6 dice; H.P.: 37, 34) hell hounds are here. If the 
young at 21, are attacked and yelp, the six beasts will split into 
two groups, half circling southwest, the other half circling 


south and then west. They love their handler at 23. No 
treasure. 

23. KENNEL KEEPER'S QUARTERS: Here dwells the Keeper 
and his wife (H.P.: 68, 59). These fire giants will rush to the aid 
of their charges if they hear a commotion outside. Each has a 
sword and club. (The Keeper's wife fights as a male due to her 
size and strength, the Keeper fights at +1 to hit and +3 
damage). Their chamber contains a large bed, a table, 2 
chairs, a bench, a chest, a cabinet, 3 barrels (beer and ale), 2 
buckets, and a crate (dried meat for the hounds). There are 
torches burning. Pegs hold wearing apparel and 2 bags. The 
second bucket has a false bottom which holds 199 p.p. and 68 
50 g.p. base value gems. There is a shield, axe, and 4 javelins 
of lightning on the wall to the north. There are hides and pelts 
on the floor and walls. A number of skins and furs are heaped 
on the bed and bench. One of the 6 on the bench is a hell 
hound hide which allows the wearertoappearto all observers 
as a hell hound and if it is worn for 3 full turns the wearer gains 
the abilities of a 7 dice hell hound. If it is worn for 8 
consecutive hours, the wearer becomes a true hell hound, 
and remains such forever. This magical pelt is used to wrap a 
cursed sword -2. There are 3 other hell hound hides in the 
chamber, all quite normal. 

24. GUARD POST: 2 fire giants are on duty here at all times. Each 
has 59 hit points, is armed with sword and spear, and has 4 
boulders nearby. An iron cylinder near the north wall is struck 
to sound the alarm if intruders are seen. 

25. BARRACKS: 8 fire giants (H.P.: 73, 65, 58, 56, 2x55, 54, 51) 
loafing and gaming. There are 10 cots, 10 chests, a table, 2 
benches, 4 stools, and a large wardrobe about the place. 
There are several pegs here and there, and they hold cloaks, 
capes, shields, and 5 bags. There are only worthless giant 
items in the chests and other containers. The guards here 
have swords and spears. The largest fights with a battle axe +3 
(man-sized) after throwing his spear. There are also 21 
boulders in the place. The easternmost of the three pillars has 
a secret door and contains 7,842 g.p. and 3 pieces of gem- 
studded jewelry worth 1,000 to 8,000 g.p. each.

KEY TO LEVEL #2 

Wandering Monsters: 

Encounter occurs 1 in 1 0 (dl 0), check each turn. 

1 . 2 fire giants and 2 fire giantesses 

2. 2 trolls escorting 3 hill, 2 stone, or 2 frost giants 

3. 4 trolls with 4-16 gnolls (armed) 

4. Draw fighter-magic-user (7-7) with 2-8 wererats 

Encounter Areas: 

1 . HALL OF DEAD KINGS: This dark hall contains 20 huge 
sarcophagi (lettered A-T) standing upright along the walls, 
and 4 even larger ones (letter U-X) lay upon the floor. 
Those upon the floor are of stone, and U and V have stone 
likenesses of fire giants carved upon their lids, while W and 
X are blank. Those that line the walls are stone (A, B, C, F, 
G, H, J, O, P, Q), iron (D, E), bronze (I, K, L, M, N, R), and 
brass (S, T). All of them bear likenesses of fire giant kings 
and queens (13 and 1 1 respectively). Examination will 
reveal that these burial vaults contain only the remains of 
the king or queen, moldering garments, a few corroded 
weapons, and similar things. (Wererat grave robbers have 
taken anything of value long ago.) The secret tunnel in the 
southeast corner is about 2' diameter. It twists and turns so 
that any person using it will lose all sense of direction. It 
exists on level #3 at area 2. 

2. ETTIN GUARDS' CHAMBER: 4 ettins (H.P.: 53, 49, 48,46), 
who are not on duty but generally serve as guards at level 
#1, location 22 are asleep and the other 2 are quite alert. 
Each is armed with morning star (+1) and spear, although 
those sleeping have their weapons to the side. The 
chamber has a rude table, a bench, 2 stools and 4 cots. 
Torches light up the place. There are 9 pegs holding 
clothing and 6 bags. In the far corner is a hamper with 6 
sacks of coppers, each sack holding 5,100 to 5,800. This is 
the ettins' accumulated pay... 

3. VISITORS' CHAMBER: This room houses 4 stone giants 
(H.P.: 47, 45,44, 40) who have been working forthe King as 
engineers. Each has a club, and there are also 1 1 boulders 
in the place. The room is torchlit and contains 4 cots, 4 
stools, 4 lockers, a table, a big barrel of beer, and pegs 
holding clothing and 4 sacks. A haunch of meat is on the 
table along with various mugs and platters of tin. Each 
giant has 1,000 to 4,000 g.p. and 3-12 base 100 g.p. gems. 

4. STORAGE ROOM: This area has been cleaned out to serve 
as quarters for either 5 hill giants (H.P.: 46, 40, 38, 37, 36) 
club armed, or the hill giant Chief (H.P.: 64, AC 2; fights as a 
frost giant), his wife (H.P.: 41; fights as a male hill giant), 
and 1 or2 cave bears (H.P.: 42 forthe Chief's bear, 35 for his 
wife's) if they survived. In the former case the room will 
have 5 heaps of skins for bedding, a table, 2 benches, and 2 
chests. In the latter case the place will have 2 cots, 2 trunks, 
a chain, 2 stools, a table, and a coffer. Usual hill giants will 
have only 200 to 1,200 g.p. each. The Chief will have 
brought along whatever he could salvage and carry here. 
In any case, the room is illuminated by 4 torches set in wall 
cressets. 

5. COMMUNITY QUARTERS CHAMBER: In this large area 
are housed the following fire giants - 1 "sergeant" (H.P.: 
66), 3 other males (H.P.: 60, 58,55), 6 females (H.P.: 53,50, 
47,44,41 ,40), and 8 young (H.P.: 37,36,33,28,25,23,20, 
17). There are 2 large beds, 5 cots, 7 bunks, 2 large 
cabinets, 2 tables, 4 chairs, 4 stools, 3 buckets, 4 chests, 6 
hampers, a crate, and 3 small boxes here and there. There 
are torches on the walls as well as pegs holding clothing 
and 7 bags. Miscellaneous gear, eating utensils, and odds 
and ends are scattered about the place, too. Each male has 
200 to 400 g.p. in his bag, and the females have 100 to 300 
g.p. each hidden in their personal areas. All are armed with 
various weapons, even the young, and there are 20 
throwing rocks in the chamber. 


6. SMITHY: You might wish to announce that a hammering, 
obviously of metal, occasionally is heard in this area. In any 
event, the hall outside this place is tinged a bloody red with 
the light from the lava bed and gas jets in the smithy. A 
knotty-limbed, burly fire giant (H.P.: 70) is working here. 
He is the weapon and iron smith. His exceptional strength 
gives him +2 to hit and +4 h.p. damage. The molten lava is 
used to heat the items he works. With him are 2 trolls 
(H.P.: 40, 38) who serve as his assistants. About him are 3 
giant swords, some various pieces of armor and several 
axe and spear heads. He is fashioning a special mace (1 to 
12/1 to 8 versus man-sized/larger opponents), one of black 
metal which is a +4 magical weapon he is merely doing a bit 
of repair work on. If he is attacked, there is a 2 in 6 chance 
per melee round that he will toss the mace into the lava bed 
and destroy it if the encounter is going against him. 

7. TORTURE CHAMBER: The steps lead down to this 
cluttered room with a 50' ceiling (which enables even very 
tall victims to be hung in chains well above the floor). 
Vision range is 15'. The King's Torturer (H.P.: 59) and the 
Royal Headsman (H.P.: 63) are playing knucklebones 
with stakes of 7 pieces of jewelry (1,000 to 4,000 g.p. value 
each), and 2 piles of gems (totalling 68 base 1 Og.p. and 39 
base 50 g.p.). The Headsman has his gigantic axe at hand- 
a +2 weapon only when a creature at least as strong and 
massive as he is employs it. If he hits with a natural 20, he 
severs an arm (1 or 2), a leg (3), or a head (4, 5, or 6). 
Damage from the weapon is 1 2to42(10d4+2weapononly) 
hit points. The Torturer has a sword nearby. If both are 
meleed, they will react as follows: TheTorturerwill grab his 
opponent and attempt to throw him or her into the iron 
maiden (position shown by a circle A) and slam it shut 
(causing 1 0 to 100 hit points of damage to the victim and 
trapping him or hertherein until released). This requires a 
"to hit" score success (which indicates that the grab and 
hurl score were successful) plus another successful "to 
hit" score, this time at +4, to slam the device shut. If the 
Headsman is closely pressed he will grab and toss his 
opponent down the well (position shown by a circled letter 
B), thus inflicting 9d6 of damage (but modified by 
discarding all 6s rolled, as the water 90' below breaks the 
fall, so actual damage will range from 0to45) and trapping 
the victim, possibly to drown. The Headsman requires only 
a "to hit" success to do this. The Torturer will likewise 
follow this course of attacking, tossing as many victims as 
possible down the well until the room is cleared of 
opponents. The Headsman will generally use his axe. The 
stairway and the torture chamber are lit by torches. The 
chamber contains a large rack, a smaller one, and 5 other 
pieces of appropriate equipment, in addition to the iron 
maiden and well. Various chains, bats, irons, whips, ropes, 
wires, and the like are festooned about it. A table, 2 chairs, 
a stool, and a large barrel of ale complete the picture. 

CELLS: All cells are indicated by a "C" preceded by the cell 
number. "G" is the guardroom forthe cell complex. Cells 
have rings set in the walls, chains, buckets, and straw 
heaps. 

1c. Elven female for sacrifice in the Temple. She is of highly 
noble birth and will send her rescuers 10,000 g.p., 20 arrows 
+1, an arrow of giant slaying, and a set of cloak and boots of 
elvenkind if she escapes. The reward will come from 1 to 2 
months after she leaves to return home. 

2c. 8 male elves meant for sacrifice in the Temple. They are 
normal elves only. 

3c. Merchant being held for ransom. He is a normal human, and 
he cannot pay. 

4c. Empty cell. There is a one-way invisible door at the back of 
this cell which opens only with a key held by the Drow at 12. 

5c. 2 noble centaurs (H.P.: 30, 27) imprisoned and bound for 
torture and execution. They will offer at least minimal help 
to any who free them. 


22 



6c. Empty cell. 

7c. 3 gnolls being punished for insubordination, 1 is dead. 

8c. Empty cell. 

9c. Troll (H.P.: 36) being used for torture practice, as it was 
disliked and caused trouble. It is mindless and enraged, so it 
will attack instantly if given a chance, but it otherwise sits 
motionless. It hits with a + 1 bonus for both attack probability 
and damage. 

10c. 7 gnolls (H.P.: 14,2x13,12,2x1 1 ,9) caught stealing gold. 
They will not help any creature and if freed they will simply 
run away as fast as possible. 

1 1 c.2humanskeletons. 

12c. Human female (11th level thief: H.P.: 61; Strength 15, 
Intelligence 15, Wisdom 8, Dexterity 18, Constitution 16, 
Charisma 1 7) chained to the wall. She will gladly admit to 
being a thief caught trying to find the King's treasure room, 
and volunteer to aid the party faithfully for a chance to 
escape. If opportunity presents itself, she will heist as much 
in gems and magic as she can and then slip away, but until 
then she will actually help the party. Of course, during this 
time she will be casing each character to learn what he or 
she carries. . . . 



failing to be properly deferential to Snurre. He is Boldo, the 
King's chief lieutenant, and he will do anything to get back 
into Snurre's favor. So he will happily lie to the party and tell 
them he is here because he tried to prevent Snurre from 
taking his current hostile course, and if he is freed he can get 
several other fire giants to aid them in overthrowing and 
slaying the King. Boldo will betray them at his earliest 
opportunity. He is quite bright, and he will not be rash. 

14c. Titan: This unfortunate is chained and drugged. He has 20 
hit dice (1 26 hit points), is AC-1, and strikes for 7-42 hit 
points of damage per attack. He is able to employ spells up 
to 6th level clerical. If he were aware, he would help any 
party to destroy the inhabitants of this place, although he 
would certainly not mind seeing evil characters in any party 
die also. Only a neutralize poison spell will remove the drug 
from his system before 1 2 hours time (when it will be 
naturally eliminated). 


G. GUARD ROOM: 1 fire giant (H.P.: 58) and 3 wererats 
(H.P.: 22,1 9,1 8) in man-form are conversing here. The 
giant has his sword, a spear, and 2 boulders nearby. 
Each wererat has a +1 short sword (no alignment, 
abilities, etc.; these are black metal Drow-made 
weapons which are simply very hard and very sharp) 
and dagger. The room is torchlit, and in it are a table, 
chair, stool, bench, and several kegs. On the walls are 
pegs holding a bag, a cape, a shield, keys to the cells, 
and ashirt. Keg#1 holds small beer,#2 holds water, and 
#3 holds mead. A smaller keg on the table holds 
excellent wine (and also the drug which stupefies the 
titan with a mere quart or so . . .).There is a loose stone 
in the floor to the east of the door. It hides a cache of 321 
e.p., 608 g.p., and 21 2 p.p. The guard wears a brooch on 
his cloak which is set with 6 50 g.p. base value gems 
around 1 of 500 g.p. base value. (He knows nothing of 
the secret tunnel to area 8.) If the encounter seems to 
be unfavorable, the wererats will turn into rats and 
escape down the drain at X in the room, thus alerting 
the Drow of the party. It this happens, the Drow will 
never be surprised by the party. The secret door to the 
east opens into a passage about 1 ' wide and 1^ high. It 
is rough, and a man in armor could not hope to pass 
along its length. Even a halfling would have to worm 
down it. 

8. SECRET ROOM: This place is pitch dark and is the lairof 7 
wererats (H.P.: 24,21,19,18,16,15,1 4)armedinthesame 
manner as those in the guardroom above. The strongest 
has poison on his dagger, and #3 and #7 use it on their 
swords. They will always attack by either surprise ( 1-3) or 
complete surprise (4-6). If the encounter is going badly, 
survivors will flee down the stairway to level #3, area 15, 
and warn the Drow (cf. the wererat action in the 
guardroom). In the secret room are 3 very heavy iron 
chests, all locked, and each has a poisoned needle in the 
latch which hits on a 1 2 or better. Chest#1 holds 7 pieces of 
1,000 to 4,000 g.p. jewelry, 9 pieces of 1,000 to 10,000 g.p. 
jewelry, and 3,200 g.p. Chest #2 contains a poison potion, 
8,000 g.p., and a scroll of protection from lycanthropes. 
Chest #3 fires 2 poisoned darts upwards when the lid is 
opened, the darts hitting AC 1 0 on a 6 or better, and the 
poison being such that saves are made at -1. The chest is 
empty, but an inscription covered by invisibility is written 
inside the lid, and it shows where a stone in the stairs down 
can be removed to reveal a ring of shooting stars, a rod of 
cancellation, a scroll of 7 cleric spells (determine at 
random), and 6 potions (healing, diminution, plus random 
ly determined). A very well-hidden secret compartment in 
the lid of the box holding the potions holds pipes of the 
sewers. 

9.-11. TEMPLE OF THE EYE: Note the illusion walls which screen 
this area. This place is illuminated by a strange swirling 
light which seems to be part of the very air of the place. 
Eddies of luminosity drift and swirl here and there, causing 
the whole scene to be strange and uncertain. Distances 
and dimensions are tricky to determine in the shifting light 
of rusty purple motes and lavender rays. Globs of mauve 
and violet seem to seep and slide around. The ceiling of the 
Temple is out of visual range, 50' at the lowest, and well 
over 65' where it vaults upwards. 

9. Giants' Worship Area: Each pillar radiates a sense of 
unease and insecurity (simulate this by making players 
uneasy in whatever way you find best' in a 5' radius. 
The wall to the west is a mural showing giants bowing 
to a cairn of black offering sacrifices, giving gifts, etc. 
The floor on this side of the column in the center is of 
porphyry, the pillars of serpentine, and their well- 
polished surfaces clash with each other and the 
strange light as well. The scenes on the west wall grow 
more horrific, showing human and giant sacrifice near 
the altar (north) end. 

10. Servants' & Thralls' Worship Area: The polished floor 
of red and black hornblende seems to flow between the 


23 




obsidian pillars which close off this area. Each of these 
pillars radiates mild fear in a 2' radius, and if one is 
touched, the creature contacting it must actually save 
versus fear or run away in absolute panic. Passing 
between 2 pillars causes the creature to receive 2-8 
h.p. electrical damage, or double that if wearing metal 
armor. The wall to the east shows a scene of various 
creatures crawling, then creeping, up to huge, vaguely 
squid-like creatures with 10 hairy tentacles. In the 
forefront of this mass self-sacrifice are elves and men, 
but there are also dwarves, gnolls, ores, trolls, 
halflings, ogres, goblins, etc. amongst the crowd. 
Those near the monsters are being torn apart and the 
bloody gobbets eaten as dainty morsels. There are 3 of 
these ghastly things, mottled in various shades and 
tints of purple and violet. 

1 1 . Priest's Area: The north wall of cloudy purple stone shows an 
amber-like inlay of a huge inverted triangle with a Y enclosed 
in it and touching the sides of the triangle. Beneath this, 
hanging on chains from the ceiling, is a black metal triangle 
and cylinder. The first tier of the area is of black stone shot 
through with veins of violet. The second tier is of dark gray 
stone, with specks of lilac and orange and purple. The third 
tier is dull black stone with whorls of plum and lavender and 
splotches of red. There is a great drum of blackened skin and 
chitinous material on the western third of the first tier. On the 
eastern third of this tier stands a rack from which depend 9 
silver cylinders. (These chime tubes are hollow and are worth 
1,000g.p. each.) 

On the second tier is a huge stone altar block of dull, porous- 
looking, somewhat rusty black mineral. To either side of it are 
ranked large bronze braziers whose corroded green colora 
tion is particularly nauseating in this setting. To the left and 
right of these braziers, set in triangularform with the point to 
the south, are 2 sets of 3 candelabra, each candelabrum 
having 3 branches. These are made of bronze green with age, 
and each branch holds a fat black candle which burns with a 
flame of leaping lavender and deep glowing purple but never 
grows smaller. 

Nothing save the metal triangle stands upon the third tier. 

If the altar stone is touched by living flesh or hit, itwill begin to 
fade in color, and in 3 rounds it will become a translucent 
amethyst color with a black, amorphous center. Any further 
touch when the altar is thus transformed will paralyze a 
creature touching it for 5 to 20 turns. If the drum is beaten, the 
chimes rung, and the triangle struck while the altar is 
changed, a glowing golden eye will swim into view from the 
stone's writhing center. All creatures seeing the eye must roll 
on the table below (d 12) to learn their fate: 

1. death 

2. insanity* 

3. rage (attack own party*) 

4. fright and weakness (50% strength loss)* 

5. age 1 to 20 years 

6.-12. no effect (looked away in time) 

* cured by a remove curse spell 

If the 3 tentacle rods (see area 12. hereafter) are present when 
the eye appears, however, and the braziers are lit, the altar 
becomes transparent heliotrope in color, the black mass at 
the center grows larger and shows swollen veins of purple, 
and the eye is a fiery red-orange. A tentacle will come OUT of 
the altar and grab the nearest living creature, draw it INTO the 
stone, and whatever it was will be totally gone, destroyed.The 
altar will return to its dead state, and atop of itwill be the thing 
most wished for by the party - or something which will 


enable them to attain the end or state they most desire. If a 
second summoning of this Elder Elemental God is made 
within the same day, it will act as follows (d 12): 

1. Seize and devour 1 -4 more creatures and then not grant 
any desires 

2. Strike everyone present totally blind and then not grant 
any desires 

3. Raise the ability score of each character present by 1 in 
each category and take no sacrifice 

4.-12. Ignore the whole thing 

The large pillar to the east on the first tier is of malachite 
and is covered with graven signs and sigils. If the correct pair 
are touched, the creature touching them will be transported 
to level #3, area 18. (You should devise the 24 glyphs upon 
this pillar and select which 2 are the trigger mechanism.) 

12. DROW CLERICS' AREA: The entrance is protected by a 
powerful magic spell, a Wall of Tentacles. It appears as rough 
brown-purple stone. This Wall' will require 200 hit points of 
damage to destroy, it is AC -2, and can only be harmed by 
magic weapons or the following spells: dispel magic removes 
50 of its h.p. strength), disintegrate (destroys 100 h.p. of its 
strength), or clerical symbol (of persuasion) which allows all 
those of the same alignment as the cleric who cast it, and the 
spell caster as well, to pass unharmed through the Wall of 
Tentacles. The Wall' has 20 tentacles, each of 20' length 
which strike as 10 hitdice monsters and inflict 1 to 20 points of 
abrasion and constriction damage. Up to 4 can strike one 
creature at the same time. The wall also has 2 beaks which 
attack as 10 hit dice creatures and do 1 to 10 hit points of 
damage and are poisonous. Drow can freely pass through it. 

If any other creature touches the Wall', it will grasp it and set 
off a hissing and champing noise to alert the occupants of the 
chamber beyond it. If the thing is forceably attacked and 
damaged, it will then flail out with its tentacles and inflict 
damage. If it is damaged so as to be less than 100 hit points 
strength, or if it is attacked by any type of spell or spell-like 
magic (such as a wand attack) it will generate darkness, 20' 
radius, and begin biting with its beaks if any creature comes 
or is brought close enough. (Note that the dark is only on the 
outside of the Wall'.). 

The inner chamber is lit by sconces with the same non-self 
consuming black candles as are in the Temple, so the 
illumination is dim and eerie. The walls are hung with purple 
cloth, and the floor is thickly carpeted in black. The inner 
room is screened off from the other by a brocaded hanging of 
black with thickly carpeted in black. The inner room is 
screened off from the other by a brocaded hanging of black 
with orange, gold, lilac, and mauve. There are 3 Drow herein, 
each of whom will be detailed hereafter. The antechamber is 
the quarters of 2 lesser priests. In it are 2 low black couches, 
each inlaid with silver. To one side is a round table and 2 arm 
chairs. At the foot of each couch is a low table with a basin and 
ewer of jasper (3,000 g.p. value per set). There are small stools 
and enameled coffers also. 2 chests hold personal effects. A 
huge wardrobe of ebony contains the clerics' vestments - 2 
black underrobes, 2 mauve cassocks, and caps and sashes of 
black with mauve embroidering. Coffer#1 holds a scroll with 
a cleric spell (word of recall) and 3 bars of black metal 
(adamantite worth 3,500 gold pieces each) which weigh 100 
g.p. apiece. Coffer#2 contains 100 of each type of coin, each 
type in its own black leather pouch, and a pouch of 100 base 
50 g.p. gems. A copper brazier near the door gives off an 
incense smoke which is sweet, cloying, decayed-smelling, 
disgusting, and euphoric all at once. 

The inner room is the sanctuary of the priestess. It is candle- 
illuminated, although two small braziers of black and silver 
are burning also. The walls here have certain tapestries of 
suggestive (or lewd) nature. The furnishings include a large 
bed, 2 small tables, 3 coffers, a buffet, a cabinet, a large 


24 



wardrobe, 2 divans with a low chest between them, adressing 
table and chair, a large silver mirror (worth 500 g.p.), 2 
hampers and 2 chests. All furnishings are of ebony or black 
stone. Silver inlay is usual. The wardrobe holds various 
garments and the priestess' vestments of mauve, black, and 
plum, stitched with gold. This garment is set with 10 violet 
garnets (500 g.p. each), 1 0 topazes (500 g.p. each), 10 black 
opals (1,000 g.p. each), and 10 oriental amethysts (1,000 g.p. 
each). (All stones are shown at base value.) Note that it is 
covered with a plain black wrapper to protect it. On the 
dressing table are 2 combs, a brush, 4 pins, and 10 unguent 
and cosmetic jars. These items are of onyx and silver, set with 
tiny gems. Each is worth 200 to 800 g.p. The chests and 
hampers hold her personal effects. The buffet and cabinet 
hold eating utensils, jars of spiritous liquors, tableware, etc. A 
coffer on the low chest between the divans has a poison gas 
trap (fills the whole area) and contains a scroll of 3 spells 
(gate, unholy word, restoration). A coffer near her bed 
contains 6 potions (poison, fire giant control, human control, 
philter of love, polymorph (self), philter of persuasiveness). 
Beside her bed on a small table is an ewer, basin, and goblet 
made from lapis-lazuli (each is worth 5,000 g.p.). A small 
screen of ebony, inlaid with amber (worth 1,500 g.p.) sets off 
a dressing area in the southeast corner near the wardrobe, 
where a low-backed chair stands with a gown thrown over it. 
(This effectively hides the use of the secret door.) 

The Drow clerics in this chamber are: 


CURATE #1: (4th level; H.P.: 24; Strength 9, Intelligence 17, 
Wisdom 16, Dexterity 16, Constitution 15, 
Charisma 15; AC 0 = +1 shield, +1 chainmail, 
and +2 dexterity bonus.) This male Drow is 
clad in black with violet trim. He is armed with 
a lesser tentacle rod, 4' long, with 3 tentacles of 
rubbery purple substance. When the cleric 
strikes at an opponent with this rod, each of 
the arms attacks as a 3 hit dice monster, +3 
bonus, and causes 3 hit points of damage. If all 
3 strike successfully, the victim suffers double 
damage (18 h.p.) and is slowed for 9 rounds. It 
is activated by the ring worn by the cleric. (The 
ring is of hematite with a rune carved on it and 
is worth 500 g.p.) He has the following spells: 

First Level: cause light wounds, darkness, 
fear, fear, resist cold 

Second Level: chant, hold person, silence 
(15' r.), snake charm 

CURATE #2: (4th level; H.P.: 24; Strength 10, Intelligence 
12, Wisdom 16, Dexterity 1 7, Constitution 10, 
Charisma 1 5; AC-1 =+1 shield,+1 chainmail, 
and +3 dexterity bonus.) This male Drow also 
has a ring and lesser tentacle rod, but this rod 
has arms of more reddish color and 3 
simultaneous hits causes total weakness in 
either the right or left arm, making that 
member useless for 9 rounds. It is otherwise 
like the other of its kind. His robe of black has 
pale green trim. The spells he has prepared 
are: 

First Level: cause light wounds, cause 
light wounds, fear, curse, 
resist cold 

Second Level: chant, hold person, hold per 
son, silence (15' r.) 

EHP'SS: This strangely attractive female is dressed in 
silver-embroidered black garments, with a 
small black metal cap which allows her silver 
hair to float free. She is Eclavdra (10th level 
cleric/fighter; H.P.: 60, Wisdom 17, Dexterity 
18, Constitution 10, Charisma 18; ArmorClass 
-8 = +3 shield, +5 chainmail, and +4 dexterity 
bonus), the one who fomented all of the 
trouble. She has a +4 mace on her belt. She 



wears a ring of amber set with an amethyst 
(2,500 g.p.) to control her great tentacle rod of 
6 violet arms which strike as 6 hit dice 
monsters, +6 bonus "to hit", and inflict 6 h.p. of 
damage per hit. If 3 hit simultaneously, the 
victim is numbed and strikes at -4 on attacks 
for 3 rounds, and if all 6 hit simultaneously the 
victim loses 1 point of dexterity, permanently, 
in addition to being numbed for 6 rounds. She 
has these spells: 

First Level: cause light wounds, curse, 
darkness, fear, resist cold (x2) 
Second Level: hold person, hold person, 
know alignment, silence 
(15' r.), silence (15' r.), silence 
(15'r.) 

Third Level: blindness, dispel magic, 
prayer, disease 

Fourth Level: cause serious wounds, cure 
serious wounds, poison 
Fifth Level: flame strike, true seeing 

In addition, all of the Drow can employ the 
following spells once per day: 

dancing lights, faerie fire, darkness, detect 
magic, know alignment, levitate 

The EHP'SS is also able to use these spells 
once per day: 

clairvoyance, detect lie, suggestion, dispel 
magic 

These Drow clerics speak all of the giant 
tongues, and troll and gnoll as well.

1 3. GUEST CHAMBER: 6frostgiants (H.P.: 61,59,58,55,52,49) 
who are messengers from the Jarl will be here unless the Jarl 
and his wife survived the adventure in their area. If the Jarl 
and his wife (HP.: 80, 70; AC 1 , AC 4) are here, he fights as a 
cloud giant +4, she as a f i re giant, and there wi 11 be but 2 of the 
others in the chamber to serve as guards near the door. The 
place is only dimly lit by a few torches. There are 8 cots, a long 
table, 2 benches, 2 chairs, 3 stools, 2 buckets, 6 chests, a large 
box, and a cabinet in the room. There are hides on the floors 
and pelts on the cots. Pegs hold clothing and several bags (2- 
5). Each giant has 100to400g.p. The Jarl will have whatever 
loot he managed to salvage from his stronghold. 

1 4. GUEST CHAMBER: 2 cloud giants (HP.: 78, 64), a noble and 
his lady(?) from the Ulsprue Mountains, have come to hear 
King Snurre tell why his warfare will profit them, and make 
them more powerful. The giants have 2 spotted lions (HP.: 34, 
30) as watch-animals at the door. The male has a ring coat 
(AC 1) and both have great morning stars and throwing 
boulders nearby. The female wears a thickfur garment which 
makes her AC 2. The chamber contains 2 very large beds, 2 
wardrobes, 2 small tables, a large table, 2 chairs, 2 stools, 2 
buckets, a cabinet, a bench, and 4 chests. There are tapestries 
on the walls, rugs and hides on the floor, and furs on the beds. 
The place is torchlit. On the small table near the bed to the 
south is a platinum box set with moonstones and sunstones 
(value 5,000 g.p.). It holds 78 100 g.p. base value gems, a 
present to them from the King. 



15. TROLLS' CHAMBER: 1 8 troll guards (HP.: 41,37, 3x36, 35 
2x34, 33, 31, 3x30, 29, 28, 26, 24, 22) nest here. 4 of their 
number stay in the north passage, and 4 stay in the passage 
south. Each of their positions is shown by an X. The other 1 0 
monsters remain in the large room. Each has a heap of sticks, 
bones, hide and skin scraps, and other nauseous material. 
Each has 10 to lOOg.p. hidden in their nest. There are dozens 
of various pole arms, morning stars, and swords heaped in the 
middle of the room. These are to arm the gnolls. 

16. THRALL PEN: 42 unarmed gnolls (assume each will take 1 0 
hit points) dwell here. Each has a heap of straw and a hide 
cover. Although not free, they will never help humans for any 
reason. They will gladly arm to fight intruders if given the 
chance. 

1 7. THRALL PEN: 28 unarmed gnolls (assume 1 2 hit points each) 
dwell here. See 16. for details. 


KEY TO LEVEL #3 

Referee's Notes: Level #3 is all natural, the tunnels and caverns 
showing no marks of being hollowed out except for the 
entranceway to the level from above and where the exit from the 
level is (beyond the River of Lava in the northwest corner). The 
areas of the level are dark and still. Only a few are lit-such as the 
lava cavern and where the fire giants have gathered at area 5. All 
passages are at least 15' high, small caves are 20' or so from floor 
to ceiling vault, and large caverns are anywhere from 25' to 75' 
high (areas 7. and 19.-20. should be treated as among the 
highest). A few patches of phosphorescent growth can be added 
- the light making it possible to see movement across it but not 
sufficient to illuminate an area. If the party were to remain still, 
they might hear water dripping and perhaps a far distant echoing 
of stone striking stone - but only a singular occurrence. As is 
usual with natural areas, do not worry overmuch about describing 
direction of passages and walls of caves and caverns, let alone 
size and shape. Primitive mapping techniques under stress 
conditions would develop just about the same sort of chart as 
your players will when they explore this level . . . wretched, but 
sufficient to get from place to place. If they have made it this far, 
they do not need any help from the DM! 

Wandering Monsters: 

Encounters occur 1 in 1 2 (d 1 2), check each turn. 

1.3-12 wandering trolls 

2. 2 fire giants and 2 hell hounds patrolling 

3. 4 Drow watchers, 3 in 4 to pass the party unseen (1 
fighter/magic-user of 7th/6th level and 3 2nd level fighters, all 
armed and equipped as is usual for Drow here). 

Encounter Areas. 

1 . CAVERN: 3 ropers (H.P.: 60,48,39) of 1 2,1 1 , and 1 0 hit 
dice respectively dwell here and conceal themselves 
amongst the natural stalagmite formations. They will be 
75% likely to wait until prey is towards the center of the 
area before attacking. Each has 1 base value 100 g.p. gem 
per hit die in its internal digestive organ. Note that the 
cavern is fairly colorful, having many reddish, pale yellow, 
and shining blue-gray rock formations which glisten in 
the light of torches or lanterns. 

2. GLOWING CAVE: This small offshoot of the cavern which 
runs north and south is filled with luminous plant growth 
and contains 1 2 hungry fire beetles (H.P.: 2x1 0,9,8,3x7, 
2x6, 2x5, 4). 1 to 4 of their number will be on the ceiling 
and drop upon any creatures entering their lair, always 
surprising them unless 1 or more of the party is looking 
upwards. These creatures served as a source of gifts for 
the frost giants in the past. They have no treasure. 

3. CAVERN: As the long cavern hooks eastward and 
terminates, it provides a lair for 2 large fire lizards (H.P.: 
66, 54), a mated pair of false dragons with a clutch of 3 
eggs. Both are quite old and their skins are reddish gray 
with large mottlings of red orange, so at first glance they 
are 80% likely to be mistaken for red dragons. Their nest 
has several dozen shiny rocks, but none are gems. 

4. CAVE:4hell hounds (H.P.: 41,38, 35, 30) of 7 hit dice are 
on guard here. They will give voice if they detect any 
intruder. No treasure is here. 

5. CAVERN: 8 fire giants (H.P.: 63, 62, 59, 57, 56, 55, 53,49) 
are stationed here as a guard and reserve by Snurre's 
order (and he got his instructions from the Drow, of 
course). At either end of the place one of their number 
watches; these positions are indicated by a "G". Each 
giant is armed with a sword, spear, and has several 
boulders nearby for throwing. They have no treasure, 
although there will be piles of hides thrown for bedding, a 
hamper or two, some personal wear, and 8 bags in the 
place. In crisis situations, this is where King Snurre, 


26 


































Queen Frupy, and/or other important fire giants and 
guests will retreat to. In the event they do, there will be 
whatever goods they salvage in the cavern as treasure. 

6. GREAT VAULTED CAVERN. In the middle of this place is 
a permanent illusion of a huge sleeping red dragon atop a 
mound of treasure (cf. 7. below). What is actually there is 
a gorgon (HP.: 43) which has been charmed and 
instructed to ignore such creatures as hell hounds and 
fire giants and trolls. It obeys Drow, of course. If any 
creature speaks to it in the common tongue or in the 
language of red dragons it has been instructed to stand 
quietly but to breathe upon the creatures as soon as they 
are seen and within range. There is no treasure in the 
cavern. 


7. TREASURE TROVE CAVE: Here sleeps a real red dragon, 
an ancient male, very large, with 88 hit points and an 
armor class of -1. Brazzemal is his name, and he speaks 
and uses spells: 

First Level: detect magic, erase 

Second Level: ESP, mirror image 

Third Level: invisibility (10' r.), protection from normal 
missiles 

Fourth Level: confusion, polymorph (other) 

If the boulder is moved he will certainly awaken and use 
his ESP spell to find out who intrudes upon his privacy. If 
cornered and in desperate straits, the dragon will swearto 
anything in order to save its life. Brazzemal is persuasive 
and deceitful, of course, and his real desire will be to slay 
and devour the party. He has:

magical attacks, from 60% to 90% will be destroyed when 
he is killed. 

8. CAVE: This is a Drow guardroom, with 1 6th level (H.P.: 
35), 2 4th level (H.P.: 24, 21) and 6 2nd level (H.P.: 14, 
3x12,2x11) fighters. The 3 leaders are equipped with +2 
chain and +2 shield, which with dexterity bonus of +2 
gives each AC -2. The others are in +1 chain and normal 
shield, AC 1 with dexterity bonus. Each is armed with +1 
dagger, +1 short sword, and hand crossbow with a belt 
case holding 9 poisoned darts. (See the treatise on the 
Dark Elves herewith for details of this poison.) Two 
sentries are on duty at all times in the entry passage. The 
Drow are clothed in black capes, soft boots of black hide, 
and wear hoods over their helmets. The room has only 
their bedrolls and some miscellaneous gear. Each of the 
Dark Elves carries 1 to 10 p.p. per level. Remember the 
spell ability of these creatures! 

9. WIDE PASSAGE: 1 2 piercers make this their home, and 
they await the unwary prey patiently. The floor of the 
place is strewn with shattered skulls and bones. Amidst 
these gleaming white remains glints a gold necklace set 
with 5 gems (1 500, 2 100, 2 50 g.p.) worth 1,1 00g.p. The 
piercers are: 

2 of 1 hit die each; H.P.: 5, 3 
4 of 2 hit dice each; H.P.: 1 2, 1 1 ,2x10 
4 of 3 hit dice each; H.P.: 16, 13, 2x12 
2 of 4 hit dice each; H.P.: 22, 1 9 


10. SINGING CHAMBER: This small place has excellent 
acoustics, and the drops of water falling into the pool 
along the southwestern portion of the wall make a 
pleasant musical sound which can be heard for 60' in the 
quiet, and at 30' distance in normal conditions. The pool 
edge is lined by a huge gray ooze blob (H.P.: 24) and 
another (H.P.: 1 7) lays along a ledge 1 1 ' high in the 
southeast of the place. 

11.-13. STINKING CAVERNS: All of these spaces are inhabited 
by troll servants of King Snurre, and the stink which 
comes from these creatures, their nests, and what they 
leave about is noticeable in the corridor which leads 
southwest from area 9. Their chieftain is in area 13. Note 
how they will support each other. 

1 1 . 13trolls(H.P.:37,35,2x33,3x30,2x26,24,22,20,19), 
each with the typical messy mound of sticks and 
bones and other noisome things. In each nest are 5 to 
50 of each type of coin. If they hear a disturbance at 
12., they split into two groups and move there to 
attack. 

12.16 trolls (H P.: 36, 2x34, 33, 32, 31,30, 3x29, 2x28, 25, 
22,17,14) as above. They move in 2 groups to areal 1 . 
if they hear combat. 

13. 27 trolls (H.P.: 41,39, 38, 36, 2x33, 4x32, 2x31,29, 
2x28, 27, 2x24, 23, 20, 18, 3x17, 16, 15, 12). The 
chieftain is the strongest (41 hit points), and the other 
2 strong trolls are his lieutenants. If they hear 
suspicious noises, or if they are assaulted, the trolls 
will use the multiple passages to surprise and 
surround their attackers, leaping upon them to tear 
them to shreds. The 3 leader-types nest in the 
southeastern spur of the cavern, and each nest will 
contain 100 to 400 of each coin type. The chieftain will 
have 5 to 30 gems of base 100 g.p. value and a jeweled 
mace worth 6,500 g.p. 


27 



14. NARROW CAVERN: This place is striated with layers of 
blue and green and greenish-blue deposits and streaks. 
There is green slime growing on the passage roof and in 
the pool of water at its end. The slime on the ceiling covers 
about 40' of spacejust south of the pool, and it will drop 1 
in 6 per creature per round, i.e. check for each member of 
the party under its growth area, a 1 on a six-sided die 
indicating that the slime has dropped upon them. There 
are 36 agates (base value 10 g.p.) in the pool of water, and 
any creature reaching in to get these stones is 50% likely 
to have the slime attack. The slime in the pool blends with 
the greenish rock of the pool. 


15. GRAY CAVERN: This dark-colored place is the Draw 
strong point, and 2 guards watch each of the 6 ways which 
meet at this cavern. There are 6 other guards. These 18 
Draw are all 3rd level fighters, each with 1 8 hit points. 

Each is equipped with+1 shield,+1 chainmail, andhasa2 
+2 dexterity bonus, so armor class is 0. All 18 are armed 
with +1 dagger, +1 short sword, hand crossbow, and 1 0 
poisoned darts (1 in the crossbow, 9 in a belt case). To the 
east are several higher level Dark Elves: 

- 5th level fighter (H.P.: 30) with +2 shield and +2 
chainmail and a dexterity bonus of +4 AC -4, armed as 
above, but her sword is +3. 

- 9th level fighter (H.P.: 54) with +3 chainmail and a 
dexterity bonus of 3 for AC -5; she is armed with +3 
short sword, a +3 mace, and an atlatl with a poisoned 
javelin. 

- fighter/magic-user of 4th/6th level (H.P.: 30) with +2 
chainmail and a ring of protection +3 with a+3 dexterity 
bonus for an armor class of -3. He is a minor noble with 8 
strength, 1 7 intelligence, 1 2 wisdom, 1 7 dexterity, 9 
constitution, and 1 2 charisma. He is armed with a +2 
short sword, a + 3 dagger which is poisoned in the usual 
manner, and a wand of viscid globs. The latter weapon 
is a metallic baton which has 79 charges; each blob 
covers an area of 4 square feet with a gummy substance 
which adheres various things together-hands to items 
held, arms to shields, members to bodies. That is, 
whatever is covered by it will stick permanently to any 
other such object. It is cut by alcohol, however. The 
wand has a range of 6". The bond of the blob is stronger 
than the substances bonded, and very strong creatures 
will tear themselves apart trying to get free if enough 
effort is exerted. A saving throw applies (but blobs that 
miss must hit somewhere!). He has the following magic 
spells: 

First Level: charm person, charm person, shield, ven 
triloquism 

Second Level: ray of enfeeblement, mirror image 
Third Level: lightning bolt, slow 

Each Draw has 1 to 10 p.p. per level of his or her 
experience. Each above 4th level has 1 base 100 g.p. gem 
per level, double if multi-classes. Remember that the Dark 
Elves have innate spell abilities. All have: 

dancing lights, faerie fire, darkness 

Those above 4th level also have: 

detect magic, know alignment levitate 

All females (2 only here) have: 

clairvoyance, detect lie, suggestion, dispel magic 


16. SMALL CAVERN: Note that where the arrows are shown 
to the north of the entry passage there is a metal sphere 
trap. A fine trip wire is set so that as an intruder enters the 


cavern it triggers a torrent of small iron spheres which 
pour into the last 20' of the passageway and first 10' of the 
cavern. These V 4 inch diameter balls make a loud noise, 
and any creature in the area has a 5 in 6 chance of falling 
down for the first 3 rounds afterthey are released, and a 2 
in 6 chance for the next 3 rounds thereafter, unless it 
instantly stands still and does not move its feet. Naturally, 
still targets are easier to hit, and dexterity bonuses are 
cancelled. Creatures which fall are not able to attack, and 
they lose both shield and dexterity benefits. 

There are 9 female Draw in the place. 8 are 4th level 
fighters, special guards (H.P.: 28, 26, 25, 3x24, 22, 21). 
Each is equipped with +2 shield, +2 chainmail, and has +3 
dexterity bonus, so armor class is -3. Each is armed with 
+2 dagger, +2 short sword, hand crossbow (on belt), case 
and 9 darts, and an atlatl and 3 javelins. All of these 
missiles are poisoned in the usual manner with a 
paralyzing agent which makes victims lose their senses 
for 2 to 8 turns. These 8 guards protect Nedylene, a 
cleric/fighter noble generally opposed to anything 
Eclavdra attempts. She is here to check up on her rival, 
and she will be suspicious of any creature entering her 
current abode. On the other hand, she will not be adverse 
to seeing her rival's plans go wrong. Nedylene is an 8th 
level cleric/7th level fighter (HP.: 48; Strength 13, Intelligence 
15, Wisdom 17, Dexterity 1 6, Constitution 1 1 , Charisma 
1 7) clad in +5 chainmail, with a+3 buckler (AC -6). She is 
armed with a +3 mace and a demon staff. (The magical 
demon staff allows the wielder to cause fear in whomever 
it touches - no saving throw, inflict 4-24 hit points of 
damage which can only be healed by the passage of 1 full 
day of time per hit point upon any creature it touches, call 
forth a Type 1 demon, or turn the holder into a Type III 
demon for 5 rounds. Each of these functions operates but 
once per day, and if the demon summoned is slain, the 
creator of the staff will exact a high price.) The latter 
weapon is a black leather-like staff, very strong, and 
carved with disgusting scenes and vile runes. Nedylene 
has the following spells in addition to those which all 
Draw of her level and sex have in common: 


First Level: curse, cure light wounds, cure light wounds, 
cure light wounds, protection from good 

Second Level: detect charm, find traps, hold person, hold 
person, silence (15' r.) 

Third Level: blindness, dispel magic, prayer, remove curse 
Fourth Level: cure serious wounds, neutralize poison 


17. JEWELED CAVERN: If light strikes these formations, the 
mineral deposits here make the place glitter and sparkle 
as if it were sown with jewels. It is breathtakingly beautiful, 
and is the current lair of 3 mind flayers (HP.: 44, 41,38) 
who have decided to see what is going on with their 
friendly enemies, the Draw. They plan to observe events, 
and the Dark Elves ignore them. Each mind flayer carries 2 
to 1 2 base 100 g.p. gems (bribe money) and they have an 
amulet of the planes and a tome of clear thought in a small 
black metal box which can only be opened by persons of 
1 8 or greater intelligence. 

18. SMALL CAVERN: This is a guardroom which is exactly 
the same as area 8. above. Refer there for details. 

19.-20. RED CAVERN OF INFERNALNESS: This huge space is lit 
up in reddish light by the bubbling, steaming river of 
molten lava which flows through the place. The cavern 
stinks of sulphur and heated rock, and the temperature 
there is very hot, although a strong draft cools it 
somewhat. The roof is no less than 60' high. 


28 



19. Venting gases of flame and smoke. Amidst this 
vaporous inferno are 2 salamanders (H.P.: 45,38) who 
are enjoying a change of clime. The flames and smoke 
make them impossible to see beyond 30'. They are 
totally neutral with respect to whom they attack, 
although they know and respect the Drow. They have 
no treasure. Note that a rope bridge is suspended from 
this area to 20., about 15' above the lava river. 

20. Secluded section of the cavern which serves as the 
meeting place and council chamber for Eclavdraand her 
minions. Currently at this place are 6 2nd level male 
fighters (H.P.: 1 4,12,3 x 1 1 ,1 0), 34th level femalefighters 
(H.P.: 30, 27, 23), and an 8th level femalefighter (H.P.:60) 
particularly favored by Eclavdra. The lesser fighters are 
AC 1 (+1 buckler, +1 chainmail, +1 dexterity bonus) and 
armed with a +1 short sword, +1 dagger, and hand 
crossbow with 1 0 darts. The commander has+3 shield, +5 
chainmail, and a dexterity bonus of +1 (AC -5). She is 
armed with a +4 short sword, and a hand crossbow with 6 
poisoned and 3 magical darts (stunning - causes 
creature hit and all within 1 O' radius to be stunned for 1 -4 
melee rounds, double that for target creature, due to 
concussion and noise; blinding -effects are the same as 
the stunning dart due to the flash of the dart when it 
explodes; and vapors - which generates a cloud of 
stinking fog-like vapors 30' x 30' x 20' in proportion when 
it impacts). Note that Eclavdra will be herewith as many of 
her followers as survive if things go badly on level #2. In 
addition to bedding and a small amount of personal gear, 
there is a chest holding 2,000 p.p. and 200 gems of 100 
g.p. base value hidden under an illusion to look like a rock 
formation in the far northeastern corner of the place. 
The commander has a small coffer which contains 2 
speed potions and 2 extra-healing potions. These will be 
used by the Drow if necessary. A constant watch is kept 
on the east entry to the cavern, and if intruders come, the 
Dark Elvenfolk will know of it. If threatened by powerful 
characters, the Drow will flee to safety back down the 
passage from whence they came here, i.e. the one to the 
north-northwest: This way is protected by A: 

A. This is the location of a huge, charmed lurker 
above (HP.: 63) which causes 2-8 hit points of 
damage when it constricts its victim(s), and it will 
smother such in but 2 to 4 rounds. It will fall upon 
any creatures which pass under it after a command 
is given to it by Eclavdra. 

Equipment for a pair of hoists, derrick-like machines with straps 
for cargo of any sort - even large animals, will be found in nooks 
on either side of the river of lava. It will take several hours to set 
these hoists into working position, but once done they will not be 
disturbed. Your players will be able to move supplies and pack 
animals across the river of lava when they are ready for the next 
adventure! 


(Special Note to the Dungeon Master: If your players have 
enjoyed these scenarios and you intend to continue it with the 
balance of the modules which follow, the party will find an 
adamantite tube when they search area 20 ., a scroll, and a map 
accidentally (?) dropped by one of the fleeing noble Drow. The 
scroll contains a wish spell. The map is a continuation of the Drow 
escape route, showing a vast maze of passages on a large scale. 
There are three cryptic areas on it, which could indicate the 
whereabouts of vast subterranean cities or other strange places 
which are far deeper than any dungeon known. This map will be 
included for your players in the next module, DESCENT INTO 
THE DEPTHS OF THE EARTH, ADVANCED DUNGEONS & 
DRAGONS DUNGEON MODULE D 1-2. and a copy with full 
annotation will be included for the DM.).

Ages past, when the elvenfolk were but new to the face of the 
earth, their number was torn by discord, and those of better 
disposition drove from them those of the elves who were selfish 
and cruel. However, constant warfare between the two divisions 
of elvenkind continued, with the goodly ones ever victorious, until 
those of dark nature were forced to withdraw from the lands under 
the skies and seek safety in the realm of the underworld. Here, in 
lightless caverns and endless warrens of twisting passages and 
caves hung with icicles of stone, the Dark Elvenfolk, the Drow, 
found both refuge and comfort. Over the centuries they grew 
strong once again and schooled themselves in arcane arts. And if 
they were strong enough to face and defeat their former brethren 
in battle, the Drow no longer desired to walk upon the green lands 
underthe sun and stars. They no longerdesired a life in the upper 
world, being content with the gloomy fairyland beneath the earth 
that they had made their own. Yet they neither forgive nor forget, 
and above all else they bear enmity for all of their distant kin - 
elves and faeries - who drove them down and now dwell in the 
meadows and dells of the bright world. Though they are seldom if 
ever seen by any human or demi-human, the Drow still persist, 
and occasionally they enter lower dungeon levels and consort 
with other creatures in order to work out their schemes and inflict 
revenge upon those who inhabit the world above. 

Description: Drow are black skinned and pale haired. They are 
slight of build and have delicate fingers and toes. Their features 
are somewhat sharp and ears are pointed and large, but this does 
not make them unhandsome. Their eyes are very large, being all 
iris and pupil. Male drow are of thin build, about 5' tall, have dead 
black skin and dead white hair, and the irises of their eyes are 
orange to orange-yellow. Females are slender and shapely, about 
5V 2 ' tall, and have glossy black skin and shining silvery hair. The 
eyes of female Drow are amber, though a few are said to possess 
irises of lambent violet. 

The usual Drow fighting/traveling garb includes a pair of black 
boots and a hooded black cloak which comes to the ankles of the 
wearer. The boots are simply black boots of elvenkind manufac 
tured of a different sort of material. The cloaks are woven of spider 
silk and some unknown fiber which combined with the silk makes 
them very strong, slippery, supple, and nearly impossible to 
detect in dungeon-like surroundings. Thus, in boots and cloaks 
the Drow are 75% undetectable unless they are moving/attacking 
within 20', the former in direct view of an observer. Drow cloaks 
are usually not harmed by blows from weapons, as they slide 
aside and do not tear easily, nor are they easily burned (+6 on 
saving throws versus all fire attacks). However, these garments 
are very difficult to tailor, and to be effective, the cloaks must 
neither be above the ankles nor dragging on the ground. Any 
alteration of a Drow cloak requires a saving throw of 76% or 
better. Less than this score indicates the material frays and will 
ravel away when worn, so the cloak is useless. 

Drow wear a fine mesh armor of exquisite workmanship. It is an 
alloy of steel containing adamantite, and even the lowliest 
fighters have in effect +1 chainmail, with higher level Drow having 


29 



+2, +3, +4, or even +5 chainmail. Small bucklers are also used, 
shields of unusual shape, those of greater experience level and 
importance in the society having bucklers fashioned of adaman- 
tite so as to be +1, +2, or +3 value. 

The extraordinary nature of the Dark Elves' armor and weaponry, 
their magic-like but non-magical plusses, is due only in part to the 
adamantite alloy from which they are fashioned. The value of this 
alloy is that when it is exposed to the strange radiation in the Draw 
homeland (see MODULE D3, VAULT OF THE DROW) fora period 
of a month its magical bonuses come to the fore. If the item is 
kept from this radiation for more than a month, it loses the bonus 
and becomes merely a finely made item of normal sort. 

Regardless of the number of Draw appearing, there will always be 
one higher level. Draw males are all 2nd level fighters. Some are 
as high as 7th level in fighting ability. Males are also magic-users, 
some as high as 12th level. The female Draw are also 2nd level 
fighters, some being as high as 9th level. Most Draw clerics are 
female, and no upper limit to their level of ability is known. No 
male Draw cleric is able to go beyond 4th level. 

If more than 10 Draw are encountered there will be in addition a 
male who is a fighter/magic-user of at least 3rd level. If more than 
20 are encountered, there will be a female fighter/cleric of at least 
6th level clerical ability in addition to the male fighter/magic-user. 

If morethan30 Draw are encountered, 1 1 to 16 will be females, the 
leader will be a cleric/fighter of at least 8th/7th ability level, the 
male fighter/magic-user will be at least of 5th/4th ability level, and 
each will have an assistant of levels as previously shown for the 
type in smaller party sizes. 

Somewhere deep beneath the earth there are rumored to be vast 
caverns which house whole cities of these creatures, cities of 
natural and carven stone and minerals, places of weird and 
fantastic beauty, metropolises of the Dark Elves which are filled 
with the precious metals and jewels delved from the very core of 
the earth. But these delicate crystalline cities are also said to be 
the haunt of such monsters as the dreaded mind flayer and other 
subterranean horrors. It is told that demons walk freely amongst 
the Draw, for the Dark Elves regard them as benefactors and 
friends and so actually consort with them gladly. 

As described, all Draw move silently and with graceful quickness, 
even wearing their black mesh of armor. Each Draw carries a 
small amount of personal wealth in a soft leather bag worn around 
the neck beneath his or her mail. In addition, they arm themselves 
with long dagger and short sword of adamantite alloy (+1 to as 
high as +3 or +4 borne by noblefolk), 50% or more carry small 
crossbows which are held in one hand (6" range light crossbow) 
and shoot darts coated with a poison which makes the victim 
unconscious. Save is at -4. They inflict 1 to 3 hit points of damage 
in addition. Some few Draw also carry adamantite maces (+1 to+5) 
and/or small javelins (also poisoned) with atlatls (9" range, +3, 
+2/+1 to hit at short/medium/long range). 

Draw have superior infravision of the 12" range variety, move with 
silence and blend into shadows with 75% likelihood of success. 
Thus, they are 75% likely to surprise opponents. The Draw are 
only 127 2 % (1 in 8) likely to be surprised by opponents. They are 
also both intelligent and highly coordinated, being able to use 
either or both hands/arms for attack and defense. They make 
saving throws versus all forms of magic (clerical included) spells, 
whether from the caster or from some device, at +2. Draw magic 
resistance increases by 2% for each level of experience they have, 
with multi-classed individuals gaining this bonus for but one of 
their classes (the highest). Thus, a 7th level Draw is 64% resistant 
to any magic, and he or she will save at +2 against any magic 
which does affect him or her. 

Because the Draw have dwelled so long in the dark labyrinthine 
places under the surface of the earth, they dislike bright light. 
They will not venture forth into daylight except on the cloudiest, 
gloomiest days. If within the radius of a light or continual light 
spell the Dark Elves are 90% likely to be seen, they lose 2 from 
their dexterity, and all attacks made are at -2 on "to hit" dice rolls 
- +2 on saving throws against such attacks as applicable. If they 



are attacking targets inside the radius of light or continual light 
spells, the bright illumination causes them to suffer a "to hit" dice 
penalty of -1, and the converse +1 on saving throws against such 
attacks is awarded to the target creatures. If bright light exists, it is 
75% likely that the Draw will retire from the situation because of 
the illumination, unless such retreat imperils one of their number 
or would otherwise be harmful to their desired ends or expose 
some important feature to the light-bringing intruders. In any 
event, such light sources as torches, lanterns, magic weapons, 
fire beetle essence, or faerie fire do not adversely affect the Dark 
Elves' performance. 


Draw are able to speak common tongue, gnome, elven, and their 
own language in addition to the othertongues which their level of 
intelligence allows. Many know the languages of the various 
races of creatures which speak and dwell underground. All of the 
Dark Elves also have a silent language composed of hand 
movements, and this means of communication is capable of 
conveying virtually any information. When Draw are within 30' or 
less of each other, they also use facial and body expression, 
movement, and posture. These latter alone are capable of 
conveying considerable information, and when coupled with 
hand/finger movements the whole is as erudite as any spoke 
speech. 


All the Dark Elves can use the following spells once per day: 
dancing lights, faerie fire, darkness. Those above 4th level are 
able to detect magic, know alignment, and levitate once per day. 
Draw females can use the following spells once per day: 
clairvoyance, detect lie, suggestion, dispel magic. Draw have 
powers which are the same as dwarves with respect to stone and 
things underground. They also detect hidden or secret doors as 
elves do. 


Draw abilities are determined as follows: Strength: 8 +1 -6 (6 +1 -4 
for males), Intelligence 12+1-6(10+1 -8formales), Wisdom 8+1 - 
10 (8 + 1-4 for males), Dexterity 12 + 2-8, Constitution 4-16; 
Charisma 10 + 1 -8 (8 + 1 -8 for males). 

Special Note Regarding Drow Cloaks, Armor, and Weapons: All 

of these items have special properties, although none of them 
radiate any magic. The items are made under the conditions 
particular to the strange homeland of the Drow, for this place has 
unknown radiations which impart special properties to these 
cloaks, armor and weapons. When such items are exposed to 
direct sunlight a rotting process sets in. The process is absolutely 
irreversible, and within 2 weeks cloaks will fall to shreds, while 
armor and weapons become pitted and unusable. If items are not 
exposed to sunlight, they will retain their magical properties for 
31-50 days before losing them, and if they are exposed to the 
radiation of the Drow homeland 30 or so days, they will remain 
potent. Items not spoiled by sunlight will eventually lose their 
special properties if not exposed to the special radiation, but they 
will remain serviceable as normal cloaks, armor, shields, swords, 
maces, etc. 

Drow sleep poison decays instantly in sunlight. Its power is lost 
after about 60 days in any event, and the coating on the small bolts 
and javelins must be periodically renewed with fresh applications 
of the fungoid substance. The Dark Elves will often have small 
barrels filled with several packets of this poison, each sealed to 
insure the poisonous substance remains fresh for about 1 year.

Crystalbrittle (Alteration) 

Level: 9 Components: V, S 

Range: Touch Casting Time 9 segments 

Duration: Permanent Saving Throw: Special 

Area of Effect: 2 cubic feet/level 

Explanation/Description: The dweomer of this spell causes 
metal, whether as soft as gold or as hard as adamantite, to turn to 
a crystalline substance as brittle and fragile as crystal. Thus a 
sword, shield of metal, metal armor, or even an iron golem can be 
changed to a delicate, glass-like material easily shattered by any 
forceful blow. Furthermore, this change is unalterable short of a 
wish spell; i.e., dispel magic will not reverse the spell. The caster 
must physically touch the target item-equal to a hit in combat if 
the Item is worn, wielded, or a monster. Any single metal item can 
be affected by the spell. Thus, a suit of armor can be changed to 
crystal, but the shield would not be affected, or vice versa. All 
items gain a saving throw equal to their magical bonus value or 
protection. A +1/+3 sword would get a 10% (average of the two ! 
plusses) chance to save, +5 magic armor a 25% chance to be 
unaffected, an iron golem a 15% chance to save (for it is hit only by 
magic weapons of +3 or better quality). Artifacts and relics of 
metal have a 95% chance to be unaffected by the spell. Affected 
items not immediately protected will be shattered and per 
manently destroyed if struck by a normal blow from a metal tool or 
any weighty weapon, including a staff. 


Energy Drain (Evocation) 

Level: 9 Components: V, S, M 

Range: Touch Casting Time: 3 segments 

Duration: Permanent Saving Throw: None 

Area of Effect: 1 creature 

By casting this spell the magic-user opens a channel between the 
plane he or she is on and the Negative Material Plane, the caster 
becoming the conductor between the two planes. As soon as he 
or she touches (equal to a hit if melee is involved) any living 
creature, the victim loses two energy levels (cf. spectre in Monster 
Manual) A monster loses two hit dice permanently, both for hit 
points and attack ability. A character loses levels, hit dice and 
points, and abilities permanently (until regained through adven 
turing, if applicable). The material components of this spell is 
essence of spectre or vampire dust. Preparation requires three 
segments, the material component is cast forth, and upon 
touching the victim the magic-user speaks the triggering word 
("entropy", "nihil est", or whatever), and the dweomertakes effect 
instantly. There is always a 1 in 20 chance that the caster will also 
be affected by the energy drain and lose 1 energy level also when 
the victim is drained of two. Humans or humanoids brought to 
zero energy levels by this spell become zombies.
