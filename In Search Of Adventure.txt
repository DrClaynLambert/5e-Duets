INTRODUCTION 


Welcome to the D&D(r) adventure game 
world! You have in your hands a compilation 
of the best of the D&D(r) adventures, from the 
earliest days of the game to the present. The 
whole has been reorganized and re-edited to 
provide a continuing set of adventures for 
characters of levels 1-3. 

This book is intended as a companion vol 
ume to the gazetteer GAZl, The Grand 
Duchy of Karameikos. That book covers the 
affairs of the Duchy in depth, this one pro 
vides a scries of detailed adventures taking 
place in that setting. The gazetteer is not 
required to play these adventures, but its 
background material is useful for extended 
campaign play. 

Most of the material in this book has been 
previously published in the B-scrics of adven 
ture modules. To keep as much of the original 
material in print as possible, we have created 
an anthology of connected adventures, much 
like a collection of short stories. In selecting 
the material for this anthology, we have tried 
to gather as many different types of adven 
tures and styles of play as possible. The overall 
campaign framework herein allows a high 
degree of player choice and flexibility for the 
DM, while generally keeping the adventures 
in order of difficulty. 

The early adventures are mostly exploratory 
in nature, while the last is a challenging 
adventure of political intrigue, with the char 
acters likely to be working for opposing fac 
tions. All of the adventures arc designed for 
5-8 characters of level 1-3. 

The setting of the adventures is the Grand 
Duchy of Karameikos, a wild land overrun 
with monsters that is only nominally under 
the sway of its ruler, Duke Stefan Karameikos. 
Towns arc few and often isolated by hostile 
humanoids. Small farms and hamlets dot the 
countryside, threatened on every side. Only 
by the efforts of the powerful and heroic few 
can the Grand Duchy survive, grow, and pros 
per. It is among this powerful elite that the 
player characters strive to take their place. 

The players' characters will begin in the 
small town of Threshold in the northern part 
of the Duchy. From here they will be able to 
proceed on any one of several adventures that 
will take them to the far comers of the Duchy 
and beyond, to return at last to the capital city 
of Spccularum to prepare for even higher level 
adventures yet to come. 

In order to play the adventures in this book, 
the players should have suitably low level 
characters, the D&D(r) Basic Players Book, 
pencils, dice, and some graph paper for map 
ping. The DM should have in addition to the 
se, the D&D(r) Basic Dungeon Masters Book 


and, optionally, gazetteer GAZl. 

How to use this book 

Turn fust to the section containing the 
Adventure Flow Chart to understand how the 
adventures fit together. Next, look at the 
descriptions of the Duchy of Karameikos and 
the town of Threshold to learn about the 
world in D&D adventures! 

Getting started 

Ask your players if they want to spend a ses 
sion learning about the town or whether they 
want to adventure immediately. The intro 
duction to the town can wait always wait if the 
players are anxious to begin play. If the players 
are ready for an in-depth campaign, tell them 
as much as the general background informa 
tion on the duchy as you think they should 
know, then play out their arrival in town. 
Introduce the main NPCs they will meet and 
show them the general map of Threshold. 

If the session will emphasize play over set 
ting, read the selected adventure thoroughly 
before running it for the players. Note the 
important monsters, probable routes of tra 
vel. and any special traps or challenges the 
party will have to overcome. Be sure you 
understand how each piece of the adventure 
works to make the gaming session fun. 

The Dungeon Master's "Adventure Back 
ground" explains the purpose of the adventure, 
and may include secret information about the 
setting or major NPCs in the adventure. This 
information is not available to the player charac 
ters at the beginning of the adventure, but they 
may discover some of it during play. 

The "Players' Background" gives the infor 
mation that the player characters are assumed 
to know before the adventure begins. 

Most of the adventure is text that is keyed to 
a map of the area in which the adventure takes 
place. The number of the encounter matches 
the location of the encounter on the maps. 
Encounter information that appears in a box 
can be read aloud to the players at the proper 
time. This material represents what the char 
acters can see, hear, smell or otherwise detect 
at the beginning of an encounter. The rest of 
the encounter information may or may not be 
revealed by the DM, based on the actions of 
the player characters The DM can add more 
details to the encounter information, as 
desired: room dimensions, smells, sounds, 
monster actions if the party does nothing, etc. 

Many adventures have a concluding sec 
tion. This gives the long-term results of the 
players' actions and any notes any changes the 


party anions will have on the setting. This also 
gives the DM a chance to evaluate the players 
and make any desired adjustments to the 
overall balance of the campaign. 

The new monsters introduced in these 
adventures are summanzed in a special section 
just before the map section. They include: the 
Archer Bush, Chameleon Man, Crone of Cha 
os. Cynidiceans, Decapus, Wailing Fey, Bone 
Golem, Haunt, Lava Lizard, Wercfox (lycan- 
thrope), Pirhana Bird, Polymar, Sirenflowcr, 
Steam Weevil. Vampire Roses, Water Weird, 
and the Witch Sisters. The section starts on 
page 124. 

When a monster is described in an individ 
ual encounter description, its abilities are 
given in abbreviated form. While the exact 
statistics chosen and their order vary from 
adventure to adventure, the general form is: 

Name (number appearing): Armor Class; Hit 
Dice or Class and Level; hit points; Move 
ment per turn (per round); Number of 
Attacks per round; Damage per attack; 
Save as Class/Lcvcl; Morale; Alignment; 
Other abilities (where appropriate) 

Spells (listed by level) 

Weapons and equipment

Maps and Handouts 

The general maps for Threshold and the 
Grand Duchy, the adventure maps for all the 
adventures, and some handouts for the play 
ers arc combined into a single section at the 
back of this book. These pages are perforated 
for easy removal if desired. To remove, fold 
the page along the perforation, then carefully 
tear along the perforated edge (tearing against 
a straightedge, such as a ruler, is even better). 
Each adventure lists the page numbers of its 
maps and handouts. 

If the players are mapping during play, you 
might consider starting their maps for them 
by indicating their starting location on a blank 
piece of graph paper. 

The Grand Duchy (Map 130) 

The Duchy of Karameikos came into being 
when Duke Stefan Karameikos III of the Thy- 
atian Empire traded his ancestral lands for 
control of a wild border region west of the 
Empire known as Tralandara. For the last 30 
years, he has been trying to develop it into a 
modern nation. Much wilderness remains. 

The population of the country is divided 
between the Traladaran natives, who form the 
bulk of the population; Thyatian nobility, 
who emigrated to the Duchy with the Duke; 
and small communities of friendly demihu- 
mans: dwarves, gnomes, elves, and halflings. 
Internal threats include tribes of humanoid 
monsters (goblins, hobgoblins, ores and bug 
bears) and the rebellious Baron Ludwig von 
Hendriks, who controls an area of the Duchy 
known as the Black Eagle Barony. 

Other important factions in the Duchy 
include: 

Churches: The Church of Karameikos 
(23%) is the favored church of the nobility, 
similar to religious institutions of late medie 
val times. The Church of Traladara (70%) is 
the favored church of the natives, similar to 
religious institutions of early medieval times. 
The Cult of Halav (5 %) is a fringe group that 
believes Stefan Karameikos is the reincarna 
tion of an ancient hero who will restore the 
lost glory of Traladara. 

The Order of the Griffon is a military order 
open to higher level fighters and clerics that 
supports the Church of Karameikos. 

Thieves' Guilds: Most thieves arc indepen 


dent The Kingdom of the Thieves is strong in 
Specularum. It is for neutral thieves, specializ 
ing in complex burglaries. The Iron Ring is a 
secret society of slavers and assassins (mostly 
chaotics of any class) that is very widespread. 

Taxes and Tithes. Four times a year, a 25 % 
tax is levied on everyone in Karameikos by the 
Duke. Sales taxes run 5%. merchants pay 1% 
on all valuable cargoes. Clerics are expected to 
tithe 10% to the church, and many give more. 
This may seem harsh, but that is what pays for 
the military and for developing the Duchy. 
The situation is much the same in other parts 
of the D&D(r) campaign world. 

In the official coinage of Karameikos, a 
copper piece is a kopec, a silver piece is called a 
cron a, and a gold piece is a royal. 

The following arc the major points of interest 
in a campaign in Karameikos: 

Towns and Cities. Threshold (pop. 5,000) is 
the base for early adventures and has its own 
section. Specularum (50,000) is the capital, 
and many details of its life and politics appear 
in the last adventure. Kelvin (20,000) and 
Luln (5.000) arc major population centers, 
ruled by Baron Desmond Kelvin II and Town- 
mistress Sascia (a high level fighter), respec 
tively. Fort Doom (10,000) is the main 
population center of the Black Eagle Barony, 
the only place in Karameikos where slavery is 
legal Highforge (6500 gnomes, 1000 
dwarves) is a major demihuman community 
ruled by Dorfiis Hilltopper, the Gnome- 
King. Rifllian (1700, mostly elves) is a trading 
post where humans and elves meet, run by the 
elven Chief Trader, Prestellc. The other small 
towns and villages are fairly typical and 
unlikely to figure in the adventures in this col 
lection. 

Forts: Castellan Keep, Duke's Road Keep. 
Radlcbb Keep, River Fork Keep, and Rugalov 
Keep are military posts that guard the borders 
of the Duchy. Each has a garrison of about 240 
men, led by a high (8th) level fighter with 
lower level officers. About 20% of each garri 
son can be mounted, and about 20% can take 
the field with crossbows. 

Other places: Koriszegy Keep is haunted 
and very dangerous. Haven is the location of 
the Silver Princess adventure. 

Threshold 

Threshold is a logging community of about 
5000, ably ruled by Sherlane Halaran. baron 
and Patriarch of the Church. The town is large 
for its population, filled with widely-spaced 
homes surrounded by vegetable gardens and 
livestock pens. The map of Threshold appears 


on page 129. The local points of interest 
include: 

1own Hall. This is a very large building in the 
center of town, used for confiscated weapon 
storage, town meetings, public declarations, 
trials and entertainments. 

Fogor Isle. This island is the seamy side of 
town; it is not patrolled at night. On the north 
end of the island is the blackened ruin of the 
Old Mill, burned 15 years ago. The ruin often 
becomes infested by giant insects and must be 
cleaned out periodically. 

Tamskecp. Baron Halaran's castle is a small, 
sturdy fortress, just north of town. It has a cur 
tain wall, four towers and a large manor 
house. 

Dam and Weir. The dam keeps large boats 
from traveling upriver. The weir can be 
opened to allow lumber to be floated down 
stream. 

hogging Camp Most of the logs cut locally arc 
floated downriver to Specularum, where they 
arc used for building, ship construction, and 
so on. 

Ruins. North of Threshold, on the 
west shore of the lake, are the quiet ruins of an 
ancient town where no one ventures. 

The Adventurer's Threshold 

7 own Law. Threshold is usually peaceful, and 
its citizens want to keep it that way! Within 
town limits, no weapons other than daggers, 
swords, and staves may be carried. Other 
weapons must be turned in and will be kept in 
the town hall, to be returned when the owner 
leaves. Weanng armor, while not illegal, will 
result in repeated questioning of those not 
obviously arriving or leaving town. No public 
casting of magic-user spells is allowed, and 
penalties for causing property damage or inju 
ry with magic arc severe. The laws arc enforced 
by the town guard, who are mostly first-level 
fighters; high level support can be brought in 
if necessary. Most NPC adventurer's mind 
their manners while in town-few places on 
this frontier can match the services provided 
by Threshold! 

Entering Town. New arrivals arc met by Ser 
geant Arthol of the town guard, who outlines 
the local rules and regulations, collects weap 
ons, and issues receipts. Take this opportunity 
to have the players identify themselves by class 
and profession, and state in their own words 
what their business in town is. Directions to 
local inns, merchants, and other points of 
interest can be given to the players at this 
rime. 

Inns. Threshold has many inns. Rates vary, 


4 



INTRODUCTION 


but private low-level adventurer lodgings 
average about 10 gp per week, including 
meals, while sleeping in the common room 
averages 1 sp per night. 

Merchants. Most starting player characters 
will already have equipment when they enter 
Threshold. For those who don't, many indi 
vidual merchants sell their wares in Thresh 
old, and trade with Specuiarum is lively. 

Items imported into Threshold cost 150- 
200% of the list price, including: metal 
armor /weapons, warhorscs and other trained 
animals, oils, exotic cloths, glassware, metal 
goods (locks, etc.), parchments and inks, 
wines and ales. Magics, rarely available, are 
sold by private individuals; there are no magic 
shops. Merchants usually pay no more than 
half the value of an item brought in for sale by 
adventurers if they are interested at all. Ships 
other than rafts must be ordered in Specu 
iarum and brought upriver (these cost far too 
much much for starting characters to buy). 

Thieves' Guild. Neutral character thieves 
can join the Thieves' Guild (part of the King 
dom of Thieves), which offers certain advan 
tages: fairly trouble-free fencing of goods, 
some expedition backing and other services, 
for which the thief is expected to turn over 
15% of his or her income. Although most of 
the thieves in Karamcikos are independents, 
character thieves who operate in town without 
guild consent might run afoul of the guild as 
well as the town guard. 

Training. Although magic-users arc rare, at 
least two or three 7th level teachers should be 
made available to player character magic-users 
in Threshold. These NPCs can also serve as 
expedition backers. Most other class-related 
special training is available here also. 

The Church. The Church provides needed 
support for adventurers, and is most impor 
tant as a source of aid when the character are 
badly wounded or find cursed items. The 
church can provide a useful control on excess 
cash or magical items in the campaign, and 
may occasionally sponsor major expeditions. 
Clerical aid for those not in good standing is 
usually more expensive, when available. 

Banking: The standard fee for money 
changing (including exchanging gems or jew 
elry for coins) is 10%. Funds can be stored 
without charge if they arc left at least one 
month, otherwise there is a 10% charge. Bor 
rowing more than the most trifling amount (5 
gp) requires the starting character to put up an 
item of at least double value until the loan is 
repaid. 

Additional details on Threshold and life in 
the Grand Duchy can be found in GAZl. The 
Grand Duchy of Karamcikos Gazetteer. 


Adventuring from Threshold 

The following rumors arc immediately availa 
ble to adventurers. Only those indicated will 
lead to immediate adventures. 

1. The merchant Clifton Caldwell has pur 
chased the Old Antilles Castle, five miles 
west of Threshold. He has posted adver- 
tisments in local taverns for "Qualified 
Eviction Personnel" (CALDWELL'S 
CASTLE). 

2. A renagade cleric named Elwyn has been 
organizing a large raiding party of ores 
three days ride to the east. The Patriarch 
himself wants it investigated (EIWYN'S 
SANCTUARY). 

3. An elvish merchant named Sindar needs 
a package delivered to his partner in 
Sclenica, far to the north (RAHASIA). 

4. Goblins are raiding along the Black Eagle 
Barony border. The Baron is suspected. 

5. A merchant has been making inquiries 
about something called "The Rock". 

6. A foreign nobleman who owned a whole 
fleet of ships was assassinated a week ago 
in Specuiarum. The Iron Ring, a secret 
society of thieves and slavers, is being 
blamed. 

7. A missing fighter of renown. Rogahn the 
Fearless, long missing, is believed alive 
and working for Baron Hendriks. 

8. Gnomes are smuggling gems down the 
river in hollowed logs. 

Note: The elvish merchant Sindar has a part 
ner named Amulf Armbruster in Sclenica and 
is father to the elf maid Merisa (sec Rahasia). 
Whenever the players follow up this rumor, he 
will ask the party to deliver a package to Meri 
sa also (a wedding gift for Rahasia). He will 
make the characters swear to do everything in 
their power to deliver the packages. 

Wilderness Movement 

Normally, D&D(r) Basic adventures take place 
only in indoor or underground settings and do 
not deal with long overland journeys. Charac 
ters can be transported from adventure to 
adventure by assuming safe movement 
("After three days you arrive at the Caves of 
Chaos..."), and this is recommended if you 


arc just starting out. The suggestions in this 
section can be used if you want more detailed 
wilderness play. 


Movement in the Wilderness. The number of 
miles a character travels per day in the wilder 
ness equals the normal movement race 
divided by 5. For example, a character who 
moves 90' per turn can travel up to 18 miles 
per day in the wilderness. The movement rate 
for mounted travel is figured in the same way. 
A character on an unencumbered riding horse 
can ride 48 miles per day (240' divided by 5 
equals 48). 


Terrain 


Movement is... 


On a good road 
Clear, city, trail .grasslands 
Forest, hills, desert. broken 
Mountain, jungle, swamp 


3 12 Normal 
Normal 
2/3 Normal 
1/2 Normal 


A party can move through several different 
types of terrain in a single day if its movement 
rate is great enough. 


Outdoor Scale. The basic measure of wilder 
ness distance is the yard. The dungeon move 
ment rate number for is also used for outdoor 
movement, but is read as yards instead of feet. 
The distance moved in a combat round is also 
read as yards. 

Missile and spell ranges are also read as 
yards in the wilderness. 

The area affected by a spell is not read as 
yards! Thus, a fireball spell cast in the wilder 
ness would have a range of 240 yards, but still 
affect an area 40 feet in diameter. 


Horse, Rtdtng: AC 7; HD 2; MV 240' (80'); 
HAT 2 hooves; D 1-4/1-4; Save F2; ML 7; 
ALN 


A riding horse only fights in self defense or 
if guided. While guiding a horse's attack, the 
mounted character cannot attack or cast spells, 
bur can take other actions (such as changing 
weapons or drinking a potion). Any character 
class can ride a horse. 

A riding horse can carry 3,000 cn of weight 
at the normal movement rate, or up to 6.000 
cn of weight at half the normal movement 
rate. 

A riding horse costs 75 gp in Specuiarum. 
and two to three times as much elsewhere in 
Karamcikos. The cost in Specuiarum of a sad 
dle and bridle is 25 gp (enc. 300) and saddle 
bags cost 5 gp (enc. 100). The saddle has a 
pouch that can hold 200 cn. the saddle bags 
can hold 800 cn.

INTRODUCTION 


The Adventure Flow Chart 

The Adventure flow chart given on this page is a 
device that allows the DM to sec at a glance 
where the adventurers arc likely to go next, 
allowing the players to move from one adventure 
to the next with little difficulty. This book is 
divided into adventures, each part of an adven 
ture published in the B-series. and interludes. 
which provide special connecting material that 
ties the main adventures together. 

Each of the adventures given in this book is 
self-contained. If you have an original module 
for an adventure that docs not appear here in 
full, you can expand the adventure in this 
book with material from the longer work with 
little difficulty. 

The interludes deal with the consequences of 
adventures just completed, set up the next 
adventure, and suggest additional side adven 


tures and options for the playets to pursue. It is 
thus possible for a party to start down one main 
path, decide to abandon it, return to Threshold, 
stan down another path, get killed, and stan up 
a new group that adventures from Threshold, 
without playing the same adventure twice! 

While all road lead eventually to Specularum. 
two options remain open at all times: the party- 
can always arrange to return to Threshold, and 
the DM can always offer to take the parry to the 
adventure of the Silver Princess via special telc- 
pon (as detailed in Interlude E). 

Beyond this, there are three main routes. 
The first has the players operating west of 
Threshold. It begins with an elementary 
dungeon exploration, picks up with short 
overland expedition, continues to the town of 
Luln (with a wicked little surprise for the play 
ets), then comes back along the Westron Road 
to Specularum. 


The second path sends the characters east 
ward. primarily in the employ of the Church 
of Karameikos. They first recover an ancient 
relic from the evil cleric Elwyn, then attempt 
to root out an evil temple from the Caves of 
Chaos far upriver by Castellan Keep. The Sil 
ver Princess adventure takes place in a valley 
far to the east. Finally, the characters arc set 
adrift on one of the central rivers, to float 
down to Specularum dealing with the Hob 
goblin King on the way. 

The third branch sends the players northward 
out of Karameikos. as they aid an elven village 
along the Duke's Road. Turning eastward at the 
major trading center of Selenica in the country of 
Darokin, they will wander the great eastern Ala- 
siyan Desert, discovering the Lost City of Cynidi- 
cca. When they have finished adventuring 
there, they will be flown by a friendly NPC back 
to Specularum for the finale.

The DM can use Interlude E to start the Silver Princess adventure at any time.

Caldwell and Dungeons of Terror comprise a 
single adventure site. The monster statistics 
have been put into a special table at the end of 
the adventure, and the castle maps can be 
found in the map section at the end of this 
book. The adventures The Great Escape and 
Elwyn's Sanctuary also appeared in module 
B9, along with a further adventure. The 
Abduction of Princess Sylvia, which has been

BACKGROUND 

Clifton Caldwell, a local merchant, has 
recently purchased a small castle, located a 
few miles out of town. The castle had not been 
occupied for some time. Clifton had pur 
chased the casde for a ridiculously high price, 
since he had always wanted to own one. But 
when he went to visit his new home, he found 
that it was overrun by monsters! He was lucky 
to escape with his life. 

He has hired a party of adventurers (the 
player characters) to rid the castle of its mon 
strous inhabitants so that he can move in. 

NOTES FOR THE DUNGEON MASTER 

If you wish, you can roleplay Clifton's negoti 
ations with the player characters for clearing 
out the castle. Although Clifton is wealthy, he 
is a shrewd bargainer, and initially offers the 
characters 100 gold pieces apiece, in addition, 
of course, to all the treasure they find. If 
pressed, he grudgingly increases his offer, bur 
in no case offers more than 250 gp apiece. If 
you don't want to roleplay the initial bargain 
ing, just tell the players that their fee is 100 gp 
apiece. Half the money is given in advance: 
the remainder when the castle is cleared out. 

The characters should be given an ample 
opportunity to purchase supplies and equip 
ment with the money they have on hand. 

Clifton takes the characters to the casde 
and. if asked, furnishes them with a map of 
the outside of the castle (trace the outline of 
the casde for the players). You can place wan 
dering monster encounters in the forest sur 
rounding the castle if you wish. 

All the rooms on the first level of the castle 
have windows, so the party will not need 
light. The windows are too high for monsters 
to look out. and too high and narrow for the 
party to climb through. The hallway is lit by 
skylights similar to those found in rooms 3, 5, 
14, and 18. The walls, ceilings, and floors 
(except for room 31) are made of stone. The 
doors are all made of heavy oak. but arc 
unlocked and open easily unless otherwise 
stated. The ceilings in all rooms arc about 10 
feet high, except for the four tower rooms at 
the corners (rooms 6, 12, 20, and 26). where 
they arc about 25 feet high. 

Except for those monsters that are living 
together, the monsters don't form a group; 
they happen to be using this otherwise- 
abandoned casde by chance. If one or more of 
the intelligent monsters should happen to dis 
cover the party without being detected, it will 
probably attempt to flee with its life and as 
much treasure as it can manage. 


WANDERING MONSTERS 

There arc four goblins (hp 4, 5, 3, 6) wander 
ing the hallways. They are armed with short 
bows and daggers. Roll ld6 every turn that the 
party is in the hallway. On a roll of 1. the gob 
lins appear, coming around the nearest comer. 

The goblins arc caudous, but not necessar 
ily hostile. Roleplay their actions based on the 
situation and the anions of the party. 

The goblins live with the rest of the goblins 
in room 2. They are carrying 6 ep, 7 ep, 10 cp, 
and 3 cp. respectively 

The adventure begins with the party standing 
outside the double doors leading into the cas 
tle. The doors are unlocked, and swing open 
easily... 

1. ABANDONED DINING ROOM 


This room appears to have once been used 
as a dining room. There arc tables and 
benches scattered throughout the room, 
many turned on their sides or upside 
down. Everything is covered with cobwebs. 


The room is empty of monsters, but there is a 
large sack under one of the tables. The party 
will find it if they take a turn to search the 
room. The sack contains 500 sp and three 
gems, one worth 300 gp and two worth 50 gp 
each. The gems cannot be seen unless the con 
tents of the sack arc dumped out. 

2. GUARDROOM 

If the party listens at the door before opening 
it, they hear sounds of an argument in a 
strange language. If anyone understands the 
goblin tongue, they realize that there are gob 
lins in the room arguing about splitting up 
their treasure. When the party opens the 
door... 


You sec four small humanoids, each armed 
with a short sword. They arc arguing with 
each other, evidently over two large piles of 
coins on the floor. 


The room is inhabited by four goblins (hp 6, 
6, 6. 4) each armed with a shortsword. A trea 
sure of 3.000 cp, 4,000 sp, and one gem worth 
50 gp are sitting on the floor, sorted roughly 
into two piles. The goblins will fight fero 
ciously to defend cheir treasure. 

In addition to the treasure on the floor, the 
goblins carry 4 ep. 7 ep, 8 ep, and 7 ep, 
respectively, in their pockets.

CASTLE CALDWELL 


3. BEDROOM 

NOTE: The traders in rooms 3.4, and 5 want 
to save their treasure and their lives. They pre 
fer to deal with the party rather than fight. For 
example, they might be willing to trade infor 
mation about the other monsters in the castle 
in return for being allowed to leave in peace. 


You sec a man armed with a shortsword 
lying on a bed. 


The room is lit by a skylight in the northeast 
comer of the room that lets in the light, but 
not the rain. The man lying on the bed is a 
human trader armed with a shortsword. He is 
allied with the traders in rooms 4 and 5. If he 
is in trouble, he pounds on the cast wall with 
the butt of his sword to call the others. Simi 
larly, he will respond to a signal from room 4 
by first alerting the trader in room 3 and then 
going to his friend's aid. He has a large pouch 
with 8 gp and 20 sp in it. 

4. BEDROOM 


You see a man lying on a bed. He is armed 
with an axe. There is a door at the far end 
of the room. On cither side of the door arc 
windows high up on the wall. 


See the note for room 3. The man lying on the 
bed is a human trader armed with an axe + J. 
He is allied with the traders in rooms 3 and 5. 
If he is in trouble, he pounds on cither the 
cast or west wall to alert his fellows. Similarly, 
he will respond to a signal from cither room 3 
or 5 by first alerting the other trader and then 
going to his friend's aid. He has a small pouch 
with three gems (worth 60 gp. 40 gp, and 10 
gp) in it. 

5. BEDROOM 


Ybu see a man lying on a bed. He is armed 
with a shortsword. 


Sec the note for room 3. The man lying on the 
bed is a human trader armed with a 
shortsword. He is allied with the tradeis in 
rooms 4 and 3. If he is in trouble, he pounds 
on the cast wall to alert his fellows. Similarly, 
he will respond to a signal from room 4 by fust 
alerting the trader in room 3 and then going 
to his friend's aid. He has no treasure. 

This room is lit by a skylight identical to the 
one in room 3- 


6. TOWER ROOM 


You see a circular room, about 40 feet in 
diameter, with eight openings spaced 
evenly about the outside wall The win 
dows extend from about waist height to 
about head height for a normal human. 
These are obviously ports through which 
arrows can be fired. The room appears to 
be empty. 


The room is empty. 

7. UTILITY ROOM 


The east wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. The room 
appears to be empty except for a statue of a 
shepherd in the northeast corner. 


The statue is made of stone. If there is a lawful 
character in the party when it enters the room, 
the statue says, ''Greetings. May I help you?" 

The statue is able to answer questions about 
the castle and its inhabitants. It will answer 
truthfully any three questions put to it by law 
ful characters once per day. It will not respond 
at all to characters of other alignments, and 
after it has answered three questions, it will 
not respond at all until 24 hours have passed. 
The statue has 100 hit points. If it is hit by an 
edged weapon, there is a 15% chance that the 
weapon will break (5% chance for magical 
weapons). A broken edged weapon is forever 
useless. 

8. STOREROOM 


The cast wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor. There are 
two small windows above the ledge. Except 
for some trash on the floor, the room 
appears to be empty. 

Except for the trash on the floor (which is 
worthless), the room is empty. 

9. STOREROOM 


The east wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor. There arc 
two small windows above the ledge. Except 
for some trash on the floor, the room 
appears to be empty. 


Except for the trash on the floor (which is 
worthless), the room is empty. 


10. STOREROOM 


The cast wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor. There are 
two small windows above the ledge. Except 
for two long tables along the south wall, 
the room appears to be empty. As you 
enter the room, you hear the sound of 
small wings. 


The ledge in this room is used as a nesting area 
by three stirges. The sound that the party 
hears is the sound of the stirges flying to 
attack. The party has a normal chance to be 
surprised by the stirges, but the stirges cannot 
be surprised. 

A flying stirge gains a bonus of + 2 on its 
first "to hit" toll against any opponent 
because of its speed in the air. Any successful 
hit by a surge means that the stirge has 
attached itself to the victim. Each round after 
the fust hit, the stirge automatically docs 1-3 
points of damage (blood drain) until either it 
or its victim is dead. If the victim dies, the 
stirge will attack another opponent. 

Stirges like shiny things. On their ledge are 
three gems worth 500 gp, 100 gp, and 50 gp, 
respectively. The ledge can be easily reached if 
a character of normal human size stands on 
one of the tables. 

11. CHAPEL 


The east wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. There is a 
small altar on the diagonal northwest wall. 
There arc several long benches in the 
room. Iwo of them have been pushed 
together in the southeast comer to form a 
rude bed. A woman wearing atmot and 
carrying a mace kneels at the altar. 


The woman is an acolyte (1st level cleric) of 
chaotic alignment. She is armed with a mace. 
She is wearing plate mail and receives an 
armor class bonus of + 1 for high dexterity. 

There are religious items on the altar, but 
none is worth more than a few silver pieces. 
There is a small cabinet under the altar that 
contains two vials, each a potion of haling. 

If the characters do not immediately attack 
the acolyte, she offers to lead them in wor 
ship. She, like the traders in rooms 3. 4, and 
5, is anxious to avoid fighting a large party.

CASTLE CALDWELL 


12. TOWER ROOM 


You see a circular room, about 40 feet in 
diameter, with eight openings spaced 
evenly about the outside wall. The win 
dows extend from about waist height to 
about head height for a normal human. 
These are obviously ports through which 
arrows can be fired. The room appears to 
be empty. 


The room is empty.

The north wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. The room 
appears to be empty. 


The room is empty. 

14. BEDROOM 


Except for an unoccupied bed. this room 
appears to be empty. 


This room is lit by a skylight in the southwest 
comer of the room that lets in the light, but 
not the rain. A crab spider is clinging to the 
ceiling when the party enters, and drops down 
on a party member (choose at random), sur 
prising on a roll of 1-4 on a ld6. If the crab 
spider makes a successful hit, the victim takes 
normal damage and must then make a saving 
throw vs. Poison (at + 2 because the spider's 
poison is weak) or die. 

15. STOREROOM 


The north wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. Three men 
lie on pallets near the north wall. They arc 
armed with swords. A beast that looks like 
a small horse stands near the cast wall. The 
room contains a lot of what seems to be 
personal gear and equipment. 


The three men arc bandits (1st level thieves) 
who are using this room as a temporary hide 
out. All three men are armed with 
shortswords. One bandit has a cursed short 
sword -1 that only inflicts 1-5 points of dam 
age (ld6-l. but never less than 1) and gives its 
user a penalty of - 1 on hit rolls. 

The bandits have obviously been successful 
at their trade. In addition to their personal 


gear (bedrolls, food, etc.), they have six large 
sacks, each containing 500 sp. They also have 
a small wooden box that holds six gems (worth 
200 gp, 100 gp (x3). and 10 gp (x2), respec 
tively), and two pearl necklaces worth 400 gp 
each. 

The beast is a pack mule that the bandits 
keep in their room so that it will not be stolen. 
The mule fights only in its own defense, but is 
likely to get in the way of any combat in the 
room. If the party should win a fight with the 
bandits, they may, of course, use the mule for 
their own purposes. 

The bandits, like the other intelligent mon 
sters in this castle, will try to escape with their 
lives and treasure, in that order. If they should 
escape and the party takes their treasure, they 
mav return to take revenge, at the option of 
the DM. 

16. BEDROOM 


This room contains three small humanoids 
armed with spears. There is a door at the 
far end of the room, flanked by small win 
dows high up on the wall. 


The door leads to the counyard (room 31). 
The humanoids arc kobolds. They have no 
treasure. 

The kobolds do not speak the common 
tongue, and are very wary of a large party. 
They know about the wolves in room 31. If the 
pany attacks, they open the door to the court 
yard. The wolves, however, arc as likely to 
attack the kobolds as they arc the PCs. 

17. STOREROOM 


The north wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. The room 
appears to be empty. 


The room is empty. 

18. BEDROOM 


Except for an unoccupied bed, this room 
appears to be empty. 


The room is lit by an ingenious skylight in the 
southeast comer that lets in the light, but not 
the rain. The room is empty. 

19. GUARDROOM 


The north wall of this room has a ledge 


about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. The room 
looks as if it might have been a guard post. 
There arc a few beds, some pegs on the 
walls for clothing, a rack to hold weapons, 
and a long table with a drawer that might 
once have served as a desk. There are 
moth-eaten clothes on the bed, but the 
room otherwise appears to be empty. 

If the party searches the room, it will find 
under one of the beds a small sack that con 
tains 100 sp and 20 gp. 

20. TOWER ROOM 


\bu see a circular room, about 40 feet in 
diameter, with eight openings spaced 
evenly about the outside wall. The win 
dows extend from about waist height to 
about head height for a normal human. 
These arc obviously ports through which 
arrows can be fired. The room appears to 
be empty. 


The room is empty. 

21. UTILITY ROOM 

The door to this room is wizard locked, and 
cannot be opened by anyone in the party. If 
the party asks the statue in room 7 about the 
door, it will say, "Much danger, strange mag 
ic, and great treasure lies behind the door, but 
it cannot be opened by any means such as you 
possess." See the second part of this adventure 
for more details about what lies behind this 
door. For the time being, make it an unsolva- 
ble mystery for the party to ponder. 

22. STOREROOM 


The west wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. Except for 
some trash on the floor, the room appears 
to be empty. 


As soon as any character enters the room, he is 
attacked by a giant shrew. The giant shrew 
"sees" by sound, and is not affected by light 
or the lack of it. The creature is very quick, 
and automatically gains initiative on the first 
attack. It receives a bonus of +1 on its initia 
tive roll for each subsequent round of combat. 
Because of the ferocity of its attack, any victim 
of 3rd level or less must make a saving throw 
vs. Death Ray or run away in fear.

CASTLE CALDWELL 


If the party searches the room after dealing 
with the shrew, it finds a hole in the west wail 
that the shrew used to enter and leave the cas 
tle. The hole is not large enough for a man- 
sized creature to climb through. 

There is no treasure here. 

23. LIBRARY 


The west wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. Book 
shelves line the north and south walls; a 
few motheaten books remain on them. 
Two huge beetles sit on the dusty carpet in 
the middle of the room. 


These are fire beetles. They have been eating 
the carpet, and would love a real meal. 

There is no treasure here, but the party 
might think to remove the glowing glands 
from the fire beetles to use as a light source. 
The glands give off light in a 10 foot radius, 
and glow for 1-6 days after they are removed. 

24. PANTRY 


The west wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. Cabinets 
and shelves line the wall. In the middle of 
the floor lies the body of a goblin with a 
horribly swollen arm. Trash and old sacks 
are scattered about the floor. 


One of the sacks in the southwest comer con 
tains a spitting cobra. The cobra attacks only if 
its nest is disturbed. If the cobra is disturbed, 
it spits at the nearest party member, automati 
cal gaining initiative on the first round of 
combat. 

There is no treasure here. 

25. KITCHEN 


The west wall of this room has a ledge 
about seven feet from the floor, with two 
small windows above the ledge. The room 
seems to be a kitchen. There arc a number 
of tables, a pump, and an old stove. There 
is a large leather chest in the middle of the 
west wall. 


The chest is closed and strapped with leather 
belts, but is not locked. The chest is trapped. 
If opened, a cloud of poison gas issues forth, 
catching the character who opens the chest 
and anyone else within five feet. Anyone 
caught by the cloud must make a saving throw 


vs. Poison for half damage or receive 3-12 
(ldl0+2) points of damage. 

The chest is empty, but is worth 50 gp if 
sold. It is large enough to hold 2,000 coins. 

26. TOWER ROOM 


You see a circular room, about 40 feet in 
diameter, with eight openings spaced 
evenly about the outside wall. The win 
dow! extend from about waist height to 
about head height for a normal human. 
These arc obviously ports through which 
arrows can be fired. The room appears to 
be empty. 


The room is empty. 

27. BEDROOM 


This trash-filled room contains an empty 
bed with ragged bed clothes. It appears to 
be otherwise empty. A door on the east 
wall is flanked by two small windows about 
seven feet from the floor. 


There is a large sack under the bed clothes that 
contains 300 sp and 50 gp. 

28. BEDROOM 


This trash-filled room contains an empty- 
bed with ragged bed clothes. It appears to 
be otherwise empty. A door on the cast 
wail is flanked by rwo small windows about 
seven feet from the floor. 


The room is empty. 

29. BEDROOM 


This trash-filled room contains an empty 
bed with ragged bed clothes. It appears to 
be otherwise empty. A door on the east 
wall is flanked by two small windows about 
seven feet from the floor. 

The room is empty. 

30. BEDROOM 


This trash-filled room contains an empty 
bed with tagged bed clothes. It appears to 
be otherwise empty. A door on the east 
wall is flanked by two small windows about 
seven feet from the floor. 


The room is empty. 


31. COURTYARD 

NOTE: The following information must be 
changed if the party has already encountered 
the wolves in room 16. If the party has already 
found out about the wolves (for example, by 
looking through the windows into the court 
yard, or by asking the statue in room 7), they 
cannot be surprised here. 


You see a grassy courtyard open to the sky. 
Six doors, including the one by which you 
entered, line the walls. There are two large 
wolves in the middle of the courtyard. 


The wolves, had been using room 4 to get into 
the castle, but the traders had barred the door 
when they arrived a few days ago. The wolves 
arc very hungry. 

THE DUNGEONS OF TERROR 

This is the second part of the adventure in 
Castle Caldwell. When the characters cleared 
out the first level of the castle, they found a 
mysterious locked room (room 21) that was 
unopenabie by any means available to the 
party. Clifton Caldwell, concerned about the 
locked room, hired a high-level magic-user to 
unlock the door. 

The room behind the door was totally emp 
ty. except for a trap door in the floor. The win 
dows in the room had been bricked up. 

The trap door in the floor opened easily, 
but the area below was totally dark. When the 
magic-user cast a light spell through the trap 
door, she saw an empty room with an opening 
leading to a corridor. She was not willing to 
explore further, either on her own, or in the 
company of a larger party. So, Clifton has once 
again contacted the adventurers who cleared 
out the castle to tackle che dungeons down 
below... 

Notes for the Dungeon Master 

This adventure is designed as a follow-up to 
the previous adventure, but you may decide 
to have a different party explore the dungeons 
(especially if the first party did not survive!). 
In that case. Clifton must tell the new adven 
turers what took place in the previous adven 
ture. 

You can, if you wish, roleplay Clifton's 
negotiations with the party for this new mis 
sion. Claiming that the adventurers took so 
much treasure in the previous mission, and 
that there must surely be more treasure down 
below, he offers 100 gp apiece. If pressed for 
more money, he asks for a percentage of any 
treasure found in the dungeon. 


10 












CASTLE CALDWELL 


If you don't want to roleplay the negotia 
tions, tell the players that the fee for this mis 
sion is 100 gp plus treasure found in the 
dungeon. Half of the fee is paid in advance; 
the rest when the mission succeeds. 

The characters should be given ample 
opportunity to purchase supplies and equip 
ment with the money they have on hand. 

The characters can travel to the castle and 
enter room 21 without incident, unless you 
choose to add wandering monster encounters. 
There are no wandering monsters on the 
dungeon level. 

Except as noted in the text, none of the 
rooms on the dungeon level have light 
sources, so the party will need light. The hall 
ways are also dark. 

The walk and floors of the dungeon level 
have been cut from the rock. Some of the 
rooms (including 2,3, and 9-13) are obviously 
uncompleted. All doors are made of heavy 
oak. Except as noted in the text, all doors are 
unlocked and open easily. The ceilings are 
about 10 feet high throughout, but the ceil 
ings in the unfinished areas are irregular in 
height. 

Except for those monsters that are living 
together, the monsters on this level do not form 
a cooperative group. In general, they do not 
work together against the party. All the intelli 
gent monsters know how to get out of this level, 
but none arc willing to tell the party how to 
leave, even on threat of death or under torture. 

Ideally, the party should first clear all the 
rooms in this dungeon except for rooms 5 and 
14. and then find the key that opens room 5. 
If possible, avoid letting the party into that 
room until all the other areas of the dungeon 
have been explored. 

If the party should take heavy damage and 
seem in danger of not surviving this level, you 
should place several potions of healing in one 
of the rooms. Do this no more than once. 

Prepare copies of the treasure map and oth 
er materiak to hand out to the players in 
advance of the game. It k best to copy them 
using a separate sheet of paper for each one. 

1. DUNGEON ENTRANCE 

NOTE: The monster that k about to appear is 
a doppleganger. He chooses as hk fust victim 
the weakest member of the party (probably a 
magic-user). Choose the doppleganger's vic 
tim first, then fill in the blanks when you read 
aloud the copy below. 


The room appears to be empty. As the last 
party member comes through the trap 


door, the door slams shut above you. At 
the same moment a (man /woman) enters 
the room from the corridor to the north. 
(He/She) k dressed in (robes/armor/ 
leather) and looks quite a bit like (intend 
ed victim). (He/Shc) says, "Oh. don't 
worry about that old trap door. There's an 
exit at the end of thk corridor What are 
you down here for?" 


Play the pan of the doppleganger carefully. It 
appears to only want to help the pany. and 
may actually fight alongside them against oth 
er dungeon monsters. Its objective k to find 
an opportunity to ''talk" to its intended vic 
tim alone. It might tell its "friend" that it 
knows of a special treasure that they can steal 
together-but it will be ruined if the other 
party members find out about it. 

If it can get its victim alone, it attacks. If it 
kills its victim, it changes its shape to that of 
its victim and rejoins the party, making up the 
best excuse it can for what happened to the 
"other" person. It might even say, speaking as 
the person it k now impersonating, that it 
killed a doppleganger that tried to imperson 
ate it. Use your best judgement and skill in 
handling thk. should it occur. The dopple 
ganger then tries to get each member of the 
party alone in turn, and attacks them when 
they arc alone. 

If the doppleganger should impersonate 
one of the party members, talk to that charac 
ter's player privately and persuade him to play 
the pan of the doppleganger without letting 
any other player know what k going on. 

The doppleganger has no treasure with it, 
but it knows that a treasure of 500 gp k con 
cealed in the west wall of thk room, near the 
northwest comer. It k covered up and looks so 
much like the rest of the wall that it k nearly 
impossible to find without the help of the 
doppleganger or the treasure map that the 
characters may discover later. Even with 
knowledge of where the treasure k. the char 
acters must spend at least two turns digging 
into the wall to reveal the treasure. 

The trap door above k a magical one-way 
door. Once the final party member k inside, 
the door slams shut, and then dkappears! It 
does thk even if special means were used to 
prop the door open. Knock spells, thief abili 
ties, other magic, or other skills cannot open 
the trap door from the inside. The party must 
find the secret exit from the dungeon or else 
remain forever stuck. 

The doppleganger's "escape route" does not 
exist. It knows of the secret exit, but will not 
reveal it to the party under any circumstances. 


2. MAGIC-USER LAIR 


Thk room contains a sleeping area with 
two pallets, a couple of chairs, and various 
other pieces of furniture in the southwest 
corner. There k a crude laboratory along 
the north wall. It has a work bench with a 
few basic tools for doing experiments and 
an assortment of common chemicals. 
There k a faint odor of marsh gas in the air. 
A few candles provide light. Two men, 
dressed in ragged robes, sit at the bench. 


The men are mediums (1st level magic users). 
They have high dexterity, which gives them a 
+1 bonus to armor class. Each k armed with a 
dagger. The first has a migic missile spell, the 
other has a sleep spell. 

These magic users arc insane. They speak 
softly and appear to be gentle, but they have 
murder on their minds. They approach the 
party with seeming friendliness, but if they 
get dose enough, they try to bury their dag 
gers in someone's ribs. They use spelk only 
after melee has begun. Their morale k 12 
because of their insanity, so they fight to the 
death. 

Each of the mediums carries a gem worth 20 
gp. The laboratory equipment is worth 50 gp 
to a magic user. 

3. UNFINISHED ROOM 

NOTE: If any pany member listens at thk 
doot. a low humming sound k heard. 


Thk room k 80 feet wide, but only about 
10 feet deep. The north wall k unfinished 
and honeycombed with natural-looking 
holes and indentations. The floor has sev 
eral coins scattered about. You hear a faint 
humming sound. 


The holes and indentations in the north wall 
arc the nests of four robber flies. There are two 
exit passages that lead to the outside, but they 
are much too small for any pany member to 
use. 

The flics are hiding in their nests when the 
party enters, and surprise them on a roll of 1-4 
on ld6 unless the pany has lktcned at the 
door. 

There are 10 gp. 50 sp. and 100 cp scattered 
on the floor.

4. EMPTY ROOM 


This room appears ro be empty. 


The room is empty. 

5. TELEPORTATION CHAMBER 

NOTE: The key to this room is located in 
either room 9. 10, 11, 12, or 13-whichever 
the characters search last-even if the room is 
otherwise empty. Any attempt to pick the lock 
fails, regardless of dice roll (make the roll 
secretly and tell the player the attempt failed). 
The door is imbued with a special dispel mag 
ic spell that will foil any knock spell cast on it. 


The door to this room is securely locked. 
There is an ornate keyhole in the door. 


Characters can sec nothing if they look 
through the keyhole. 

When the characters finally manage to 
enter the room, they see the following: 


The room appears to be empty except for 
an open comer cabinet in the southeast 
comet. The shelves of the cabinet are 
heaped high with treasure-brilliant gems 
and elaborate pieces of jewelry. Three large 
sacks on the bottom shelf arc overflowing 
with shiny coins. The cabinet and the area 
around it seems to be bathed in a pale 
green glow. 


The cabinet is an illusion. Any character who 
approaches within 10 feet of the cabinet is 
instantly teleported to room 14. Other charac 
ters in the room see the character vanish in a 
burst of green light. 

There is an invisible barrier that extends 10 
feet from the northeast comer of the room as 
long as the cabinet appears to be in the south 
east comer. If the invisible barrier is struck, it 
yields slightly and then returns to its original 
position. 

Rooms 3 and 14 are connected by a special 
teleportation device. The two "terminals" of 
the teleporter arc the illusory cabinet in room 
5 and a coffin (called the "switching coffin") 
in room 14. The direction of the teleporter 
(from room 5 to 14 or vice versa) is dependent 
on the location of the cabinet and the switch 
ing coffin. 

When the illusory cabinet is in the south 
east comer of room 3 and the switching coffin 
is shut, the teleporter operates from room 5 to 
room 14. The invisible barrier in the northeast 


comet of the room is operating. 

If the switching coffin in room 14 is 
opened, the teleporter switches directions and 
operates from room 14 back to room 5. The 
illusory cabinet in room 5 instandy moves 
from the southeast to the northeast comer and 
the invisible barrier stops operating. Any 
character who steps into the glowing gteen cir 
cle in room 14 (see the description of that 
room) is instantly teleported back to room 5, 
and appears to walk out of the illusory cabi 
net. 

Whenever any characters are teleported 
away from the rest of the party, separate those 
players from the others. Tell the rest of the 
group only that the teleported characters have 
mysteriously vanished. The rest of the group 
should not know what happened to the van 
ished characters, or whether they are alive or 
dead. Keep the group separated until they all 
end up again in the same room. 

See the description of room 14 for more 
detail. 

6. ANTECHAMBER 


This room appears to be empty. There is a 
door on the far wall. 


The room is empty. 

7. STOREROOM 


This room appears to be empty. 


In fact, the room contains a gelatinous cube 
that surprises the party on a roll of 1 -4 on ld6. 
Inside the cube are 72 sp and a dagger +1. 

8. STOREROOM 


This room appears to be empty. 


The room is empty. 

9. EXCAVATION 


The ground in this area is covered with 
rubble from excavation work. Quite a few 
shiny coins are visible throughout the rub 
ble. 


If the party spends one turn gathering coins, 
they find 400 sp and 100 gp. If the party 
spends two or more turns, they find 600 sp 
and 150 gp. 

There is a 1 in 6 chance the first turn, a 2 in 
6 chance the second turn, a 3 in 6 chance the 


third turn, and so on, as long as the party is 
searching the room, that the berserkers from 
room 10 discover the party and attack. 

10. CAVERN 

NOTE: The following description is what the 
characters see from room 9. 


There seems to be a feeble light coming 
from the westernmost of the three open 
ings in the south wall. 


This is the lair of four berserkers. Three are 
armed with shortswords. One. the leader, is 
armed with a sword +1, +2 vs. undead (D 2- 

9). 

This area is dimly lit by a single torch stuck 
into the west wall. There arc 7,000 cp scat 
tered on the floor here. 

11. CAVERN 


The floor here is covered with rubble. 
Except for a large, poorly defined shape 
near the south wall, the area appears to be 
empty. 


The shape near the south wall is a chest, 
latched but not locked. It is trapped with 
three spring darts that fire at anyone who 
opens it unless the trap is successfully deacti 
vated or other precautions are taken. The 
darts (D 1-4 each) hit as if they were fired by a 
4 HD monster. Roll separately for each dart. 
The chest contains 700 sp and 100 gp. 

12. CONSTRUCTION 


This area appears to be empty. 


The area is empty. 

13. CAVERN 


A long, narrow passageway opens up into a 
rough-hewn chamber in the rock. Three 
humanoid figures arc near the far wall. 


The humanoids look exaedy like hobgoblins, 
but are actually thouls. 

The northeast comer of this chamber holds 
two large sacks. One sack contains 500 ep. The 
second contains 500 cp and four gems worth 
100 gp (x2) and 50 gp (x2). respectively. 


12 













INTERLUDE A 


14. TOMB 


This rectangular chamber contains ten 
stone sarcophagi with ornately carved lids. 
Each is about seven feet long and four feet 
wide. There are no doors, windows, or visi 
ble exits from the room. A decorated circle 
is inscribed on the floor. 


The coffins themselves arc far too heavy to be 
moved. The stone lids can be slid aside only by 
a group of characters whose strength scores 
totai 29 or higher. A character attempting to 
slide a stone lid must use both hands, and so 
must put down weapons and shields. 

The contents of the coffins arc as follows: 

Coffin 1 or 10 (whichever the party opens 
first): This coffin is the switching coffin that 
changes the direction of the teleporter. When 
the lid is removed, there is a flash of light and 
the floor within the inscribed circle (see map) 
glows a pale green for about 30 seconds, then 
fades. Back in room 5. the illusory cabinet 
moves from the southeast comer of the room 
to the northeast corner. The coffin is empty. 
Coffin 1 or 10 (whichever the party opens 
last): The coffin contains 1,000 sp. 

Coffin 2: The coffin contains 1.200 sp. 

Coffin 3: The coffin contains a wight, which 
attacks immediately. It surprises on a roil of I- 
3 on ld6. The coffin also contains 200 pp. 
Coffin 4: The coffin contains 1,000 sp. 

Coffin 5: This coffin is trapped with a special 
spray that affects metal as if a rust monster. All 
non-magical weapons and armor arc affected 
unless the player makes a saving throw vs. 
Death Ray. Magical armor and weapons and 
precious metals (silver, gold, or platinum) are 
not affected. The spray affects all metal in a 5 
ft. radius. The coffin also contains 300 gp. 
Coffin 6: The coffin contains 1.000 cp. 

Coffin 7: A treasure map showing the location 
of the treasure in room 1, a scroll of floating 
disc, and the piece of paper (see below) with 
the instructions for escaping the dungeon 
level. The floating disc spell can carry most of 
the coins found in this room. It will go 
through the teleporter circle with its owner. 
Coffin 8: The coffin contains a wight, which 
attacks immediately. It surprises on a roll of 1- 
3 on ld6. The coffin also contains two brace 
lets worth 300 gp and 500 gp, respectively, 
and 5 gems worth 100 gp (x3) and 50 gp (x2), 
respectively. 

Coffin 9: The coffin contains 1.100 sp. 

15. ESCAPE TUNNEL 

Copy the scroll that tells the characters how to 


escape the level, and give it to the players 
when they discover the scroll in the coffin. 

The magic words "OWAH TAGOO SIAM" 
are pronounced "Oh. what a goose I am." The 
phrase must be pronounced correctly for the 
magic to work. 

Whenever any character in the corridor out 
side rooms 4 and 5 chants those words, the ten 
foot section of the east wall of the east corridor 
marked on the map disappears, revealing the 


Whenever the characters return to town dur 
ing the adventure, they will have time to rest, 
heal and so on. The players should not be put 
under too much time pressure to complete the 
project quickly; they should be allowed to 
move at their own pace unless the action has 
slowed to the point of boredom. As long as 
everyone is having fun the other opportuni 
ties from the Threshold section will remain 
become available. 

If the unpursued adventures must be 
delayed or made unavailable for a short time 
and you wish to maintain the illusion of cam 
paign time passing. NPC parties can try and 
fail. For example, a party investigating the 
renegade dene might leave with loud fanfare, 
then turn up missing a few weeks later. Like 
wise. the local thieves' guild might steal Sin- 
dar's package and later sell it back to him after 
several days or weeks of negotiation. 

However, if the players abandon the castle 
adventure on a whim for an extended period of 
time, Clifton will complain about their breaking 
the agreement, and this word will spread- 
much to the player characters' woe! For exam 
ple. others who might hire them will need much 
convincing (let the players do their own fast talk 
ing). Another variation is that Clifton might hire 
an NPC party (which shortly starts bringing out 
big treasures). Such gentle hints arc a rime- 
honored tradition of good judging, and should 


exit corridor. The wall returns after two turns 
have passed, but disappears again whenever 
the magic phrase is said. 

The corridor leads to a door to the outside. 
The door is not locked. Brush and scrub covers 
the doorway, but once the characters clear it 
away, they are able to look up and see the cas 
tle above them. There is a faint path around 
the outside of the castle, but the area to the 
cast is heavily forested. 


only be used when players who should know 
better start getting sloppy. 

When the Castle is Cleared 

When Caldwell's Castle is finally cleared, 
word of the characters' exploits will spread all 
over town. Play up the Hero angle for the ben 
efit of the players (small children approach on 
the street and ask if its true they fought a 
lich.. .etc.) This will lead directly into the Hall 
of Rock adventure, if the players are inter 
ested. The merchant Hakeem will approach 
them as outlined in the introduction to that 
adventure on page 14. 

If the players refuse Hakeem's offer, the 
other rumors from Threshold (p.5) are still 
available In addition, the following rumors 
can be learned: 

1. The Black Eagle border raids must be get 
ting worse. A mysterious messenger from 
there arrived in Spccularum last week. 

2. A small hamlet only a day's ride to the 
east was overrun by hobgoblins several 
days ago. Everyone was killed. 

3. The frost giants in the Altan Tcpe Moun 
tains have been too quiet. Reinforce 
ments arc being sent to Castellan Keep.

INTRODUCTION 

The following is DM information. Please read 
the adventure thoroughly before trying to run 
it for the players. 

Adventure Background 

Thousands of years ago, Tuma was a city of 
wealth and glory, and its people lived by a 
code of wisdom, honor, justice, and peace. 
This city of Law roused envy and hatred in the 
hearts of those who followed the ways of Cha 
os. Many times evil armies attempted to 
destroy Tuma, but its defenders were always 
victorious. Finally, the enemies of Tuma used 
powerful evil sorceries to remove the inhabit 
ants of Tuma to another dimension, where 
they are still trapped. Over the centuries, 
Tuma became a forgotten city, the subject of 
superstition and whispererd legends. Only 
one man knows its true story-Lirdrium 
Arkayz. 

Arkayz was once pan of the ruling council 
of the city of Tuma. During the final defense 
of the city, the council decided that two mem 
bers of the council would go into hiding, so 
that if the city fell, the two hidden members 
could continue the fight. Arkayz was one of 
the two. but he was not allowed to know the 
identity of the other, so that he could not 
betray his colleague if captured. The council 
created a magical talisman which would give 
the chosen ones the power they neeeded to 
fight evil. The talisman was in two parts that 
had to be joined for its magic to be used. The 
talisman was the way the chosen ones would 
recognize each other, for no impostor would 
be able to use the magic of the amulet. The 
amulet also kept the chosen ones from aging. 
Arkayz' half was hidden in the Hall of the 
Rock. 

The enemies of Tuma could not find or 
destroy the talisman, but they cast a spell that 
made it impossible for anyone from Tima to 
recover it from its hiding place. Arkayz has 
hired adventurers to get the talisman for him, 
but all have failed. Although he is a just and 
honorable man, Arkayz never reveals the nat 
ure of the talisman or his own true identity. As 
far as anyone else is concerned, Arkayz is a 
wise and eccentric wizard who long ago gave 
up adventuring to study philosophy and write 
poetry. If the player characters reach the Hall 
of The Rock, the magic that prevents Arkayz 
from entering The Rock will be broken. He 
can then recover the talisman even if the play 
er characters do not. If the player characters 
succeed in their mission, Arkayz will at last 
have a chance to free his people. Once his part 


of the talisman is recovered, Arkayz will know 
how to find his hidden colleague, and Arkayz 
and his colleague will work together to save 
the people of Tuma. Although the talisman 
has considerable magical power, its secrets are 
beyond the reach of the player characters. 

STARTING THE 
ADVENTURE 

The player character begin the adventure in 
Threshold, which is several hours travel south 
of the Forest of Carm. When the party decides 
to visit The Manor, start them at the south 
edge of the map, at any of the three trails 
leading into the Forest of Carm. The player 
characters will not have any encounters on the 
trail leading to The Manor. 

All boxed text in the "Player's Back 
ground" and elsewhere in the module is 
encounter or event description for the players. 
Boxed text usually comes before the DM's 
information for the encounter. 

Read the boxed "Players' Background" to 
the players to start the adventure. 

Players' Background 


As you're finishing breakfast at a cheap 
inn in Threshold, a traveler walks into the 
common room. In a loud voice he says, 
"Peace be upon you all! 1, Hakeem the 
merchant, seek worthy friends in search of 
adventure!" 


If anyone decides to talk to Hakeem, he says: 


As I passed through Sylvanhome forest on 
the way here, I stopped at The Manor, a 
fine palace owned by the wizard Lirdrium 
Arkayz. His servant Jenlar Tcmlin paid me 
to deliver his message here. The wizard 
needs adventurers to undertake a quest, 
and he is willing to pay well anyone who 
answers his call. The letter of his servant 
explains all. Good day, my friends." He 
lays a scroll on your table, then turns to 
leave. 


Tell the player characters that they have heard 
local people talking about Jenlar Tcmlin-he 
has a reputation as a brave, honorable, and 
trustworthy fighter. Then give them Jenlar 
Temlin's letter andjcnlar Tcmlin's map. If the 
characters follow Hakeem out of the inn, they 
will sec him preparing to ride away on a mule. 
If they question him further, he says that he 
believes Jenlar Tcmlin and Lirdrium Arkayz to

If player characters ask others (such as tavern 
patrons or innkeepers) about Jenlar Temhn or 
Lirdrium Arkayz. they will be told that both 
are highly respected. Arkayz is a philosopher, 
sage, and advisor. The characters can get direc 
tions to The Manor from anyone they ask. 

THE FOREST 


With Jenlar Temlin's map to guide you. 
you head for The Manor. Soon you enter 
the forest, following a narrow trail that 
leads to the north. Sometimes you catch a 
fleeting glimpse of a rabbit or squirrel that 
flees at your approach. However, you see 
nothing, animal or monster, that could 
threaten you. The trail seems peaceful and 
safe. As dusk approaches, the trail opens 
into a large clearing. A majestic building 
of white marble stands in the middle of the 
clearing. The elegant house is not fortified 
or protected by a defensive wall. An open 
courtyard decorated with statues of heroic 
adventurers and fierce monsters surrounds 
the house. From the descriptions of the vil 
lagers. you know at once that this is The 
Manor of Lirdrium Arkayz-the start of 
your adventure. 


No one is in sight. If the characters scout clear 
ing, they will find nothing threatening 
When they call out or try to enter, the doors of 
the house open silendy. 

THE MANOR 


Two fighters answer the door. They say. 
"We have expected you. Jenlar Temlin is 
waiting to sec you." They escort you into a 
lavishly-furnished room with a long table 
in the middle. A middle-aged man in a red 
robe sits at the head of the table. He rises 
when you enter. His hair and long, droop 
ing mustache are red, and his eyes arc 
green. He has the look of a tough, experi 
enced warrior. He says, "I trust you had a 
safe journey. Evil creatures have learned 
not to bother us here. Welcome to The 
Manor. 1 am Jenlar Temlin. The terms for 
hiring you are these: If you go to The Rock 


and bring its secret back. Master Arkayz 
will pay 300 gold pieces to each of you. Ybu 
will also be able to keep whatever treasures 
you find along the way. Master Arkayz only 
wishes to have the secret of The Rock; he 
has no need for more wealth. We will pro 
vide riding horses for all of you, if you do 
not already have them. Vbu can start now 
or rest here overnight and set out in the 
morning."

them that "Master Arkayz is engaged in some

Whenever the characters are ready to leave, 
Jenlar Temlin speaks to them a final time. 


I have a warning to give you, one that

will be wise enough to remember it. and 
use it when you need it." 

Jenlar Temlin reaches into his robe and 
brings out a small scroll. He unwinds it, 
dears his throat and begins to read. 
'"Golden dreams can quickly turn to 
nightmares filled with flames that bum. 
Dark clouds may not bring you light, but 
watch for silver linings bright. Strength is 
not as strength might look; remember 
falsely-covered books! Simple treasures 
won't grow old, and all that glitters is not

adds. "Legends also say that the secret is in 
two parts, visible and invisible. Good luck 
to you all."

Forest Trail Encounters 

All encounter descriptions in this section 
assume that the characters arc traveling in 
daylight. If the characters decide to travel at 
night, you will have to modify encounter 
descriptions accordingly. 

Wl. HARPY CLEARING 


The trail is about 20 feet wide. Overhang 
ing trees block out most of the bright blue 
sky. The sun is still hidden by the tali trees, 
and only the bright sky lights up the forest. 
Rabbits, squirrels, and other small animals 
run among the trees, bushes and scrub. A 
few deer show their faces fot a moment, 
then turn and run until their white tails 
vanish in the thick forest. The trail seems 
to be opening up just ahead. To your right 
the line of the forest is moving away to the 
north. You come to a clearing with bright 
green grass and some patches of fragrant 
wild roses. Suddenly, you hear singing, 
soft, fair voices singing to you, calling you 
to leave the trail and come to them. 


All characters must roll a saving throw versus 
Spells. Those who fail their saving throw will 
become confused and immediately stop, tak 
ing no other action. They have been charmed 
by the song of four harpies (AC 7; HD 3*; hp 
19. 15, 15. 12; #AT 2 claws/1 mace; D 1-4/ 
1-4/1-6; MV 60' (20')/fly 150' (50'); Save F6; 
ML 7; AL Chaotic; XP 50 each) hidden in the 
tall trees of the Sylvanhomc. Characters mak 
ing a successful saving throw will not have to 
roll any further saving throws against the con 
tinued singing. The harpies will charge into 
the clearing and attack even if no one has been 


charmed. Harpies will ignore any charmed 
characters and attack the others first. They will 
still be singing even as they attack. Charmed 
characters will try to prevent others from 
attacking the harpies but charmed characters 
will not attack other player characters. The 
first harpy to attack will be the one with the 
most hit points. She drank a potion of growth 
before attacking. The potion doubled her 
size, and doubles the damage done by her 
attacks. Hct hit points are not doubled. As she 
attacks she screams, "I am mighty Hclgarth, 
queen of harpies! Who dares to attack the 
Wings of Death?" Hclgarth wears a tiara 
worth 200 gp. The other harpies have no trea 
sure. 

Any character who searches the clearing for 
clues or further dangers will find a trail on the 
north side of the clearing that leads to 
encounter W2. 

W2. LAIR OF THE HARPIES 


As you search the clearing, you find a nar 
row trail leading north out of the clearing, 
in the direction from which the harpies 
came. This trail is narrow, about 5 feet 
wide, and is overgrown with weeds and 
brambles. 


Some time ago, the harpies ordered their 
charmed victims to build a lair for them and 
cut a narrow trail from this clearing to the 
monsters' lair. The harpies themselves seldom 
used this trail, since they arc able to fly. The 
trail makes it easier to get to get the harpies' 
victims back to the lair. Characters will have to 
go in single file on the trail. Those with horses 
will have to lead them by the bridle. A player 
character will not be able to take an unbarded 
horse along this trail, as the thorns and bram 
bles would injure the horse. 


The trail is tough going. Several times, 
fighters must use their weapons to clear the 
trail ahead. After twenty minutes of travel, 
the trail opens out slightly. Blood, feath 
ers, and a broken mace lie on the trail. 


The characters will find the harpies' latest vic 
tim in the lair. Twenty minutes after the char 
acters find the signs of battle, the trail opens 
up again. 


One mile from the trail, an irregular clear 
ing 80' in diameter has been cut and 


16 







THE HALL OF ROCK 


burned into the forest. Broken saplings 
and charred logs litter the ground. A cave 
about 40' square stands in the middle of 
the clearing, 20' away from you. The cave 
is built of boulders heaped around the 
overhang of a rocky outcropping. As you 
study this ugly scene, you realize that you 
no longer hear the sounds of small forest 
creatures that were so common elsewhere 
in the forest. Here, all is silence. 


The cave entrance is 10' wide and is on the 
west side of the cave. The interior of the cave is 
dark. Anyone who approaches within five feet 
of the entrance will smell a foul stench from 
the filth and rottenness within the cave. Any 
one who looks inside with infravision or nor 
mal light will sec three small creatures inside 
the cave. 


Filth, garbage, and gnawed bones are 
strewn about the cave. Three newborn har 
pies live amid this squalor. When they see 
you, the ugly creatures utter shrill cries and 
hop toward you, feebly flapping their tiny 
wings. 


The little harpies (AC 9; HD 1/2; hp 1 each; 
MV 15' (3'); #AT0; D None; Save NM; ML7; 
AL Chaotic: XP 5) cannot harm anyone. How 
ever, they have all the evil instincts of an adult 
harpy. 

A dead cleric lies in the back of the cave. 
His backpack contains three vials of holy water 
and a scroll with a cure light wounds spell. 

The cave contains 80 gp, 700 cp, 400 sp. 
and 2 50 gp gems. 

The characters should now return to the 
trail. This side trip to the harpy lair took forty 
minutes to travel a distance of one mile. The 
difficulty of traveling in untrackcd wilderness 
should be apparent to them. 

W3. GNOMES IN THE 
WILDERNESS 


The horses seem to hear it first, stopping 
and turning their cars to the wind. Gradu 
ally your ears pick it up, too-singing! At 
first the sound is hard to identify, distant 
and faint. Soon you can pick out snatches 
of melody, the sound of many voices sing 
ing what seems to be a work song. As the 
singing grows stronger, you can barely 
maJce out...something big...being pulled 
along the trail by a team of several dozen 
humanoids. 


At this point, ask the players what their char 
acters are doing: standing in the trail and 
peering at the strange object, pressing on 
toward the mountains, or trying to conceal 
themselves somehow. If the charactcts stick 
around to find out what the object is. read the 
following description: 


As the object draws closer, it begins to take 
shape. It's a large, flat-bottomed wooden 
hull with a single mast, hitched to a dou 
ble rope harness and being pulled by sev 
eral dozen small humanoids. A dozen or so 
more humanoids arc picking up round logs 
from the rear of the ship and carrying them 
as quickly as they can to the front of the 
ship, where they drop the logs in the ship's 
path to serve as rollers. Even so, the weight 
of the ship pushes the logs into the soft 
earth, and the pullers are straining with all 
their might against the obstinate bulk. 
Standing atop the foredcck is a small 
humanoid with a beard almost as long as 
he is tall. He is shouting through a mega 
phone, exhorting his workers to pull 
harder and sing louder. 


The person on board the ship is Robem Stem- 
slate. known to his friends as "Stubborn Rob" 
and to his detractors as "Rob the Rube." (AC 
5; HD 2; hp 11; MV 60' (20'); #AT 1; D 1-4; 
Save Dl; ML 10; AL L; XP 10). Robem is 
armed with a belaying pin (treat as club). 

Robcrn and his companions are gnomes, 
but they arc a long way from home. As soon as 
the ship is within shouting distance of the 
characters (assuming the characters arc out in 
the open), Robem hollers at the gnomes pull 
ing the ship to stop and take a rest. From the 
foredeck he hollers down to the party, "Ahoy 
there! This be the Motherlode Rover! Ye 
wouldn't by any chance know where 1 could 
find an ocean round these parts, would ye? 
I've come a long way, and have yet to run 
across one!" 

If the characters respond in a friendly man 
ner, Robem has his bosun (asleep on the deck) 
pipe them aboard. The bosun blows a few 
shrill notes on a whisde and tosses a rope lad 
der over the side of the ship. 

Robem and his crew arc, in fact, searching 
for an ocean. Their trek began when a wander 
ing merchant stopped by the clan stronghold 
and sold Robem a book about shipbuilding 
and ocean navigation. Being unnaturally 
adventurous (for a gnome). Robem decided 
the ocean was something worth seeing. A 
group of gnomes from the clan bet him that 
he couldn't even find his way to an ocean. 


much less sail on it. Never one to back down 
from a challenge, Robem gathered as many 
trusted friends as he could, built his ram 
shackle ship (son of a cross between a long 
boat and a barge), and set out in search of the 
ocean. It's been several months since he left 
the clan stronghold, and he has no idea where 
to look for an ocean, but he isn't about to turn 
back in disgrace. 

In telling his story, Robcrn stresses the brav 
ery and determination of his crew. He desper 
ately needs directions to an ocean (any large 
body of water will do!), but he can't come 
right out and ask for help without admitting 
that he's lost This puts Robem in a somewhat 
awkward position. He presses the characters 
for "news of the ocean" or any nautical charts 
they might be willing to sell. 

Besides directions, Robem is interested in 
expanding his crew. Quite a few of his original 
supponers have deserted the expedition, leav 
ing him shonhanded. A few drunks and loi 
terers have been hired along the way, but 
Robem really wants to buy some draft ani 
mals. He offers the characters 60 gp apiece for 
their horses; not as much as they could get in a 
town, but a fair offer. 

The ship is loaded with food and water. 
Robem and his crew have been pulling the 
ship for several days. 

Robcrn has 40 gnomes in his crew (AC 5; 
HD 1; hp 5; MV 60' (20'); #AT 1; D 1-6; Save 
Dl; ML 10; AL L: XP 10. Each crewman has a 
boarding pike (treat as spear) but only 10 are 
armed at any one time. The rest arc working 
the toilets that keep the ship moving. 

W4. THE CHAMELEON MEN 


The trees of the Western Bough rise up on 
your right, tall and beautiful. Likewise, 
Rcndwood on your left is filled with color: 
red and yellow leaves, brown tree trunks 
covered with green moss, the blue of 
wildflowers. deep black shadows. After 3 
1 12 miles, the Western Bough forest tolls 
away to the north; one half mile away, 
across a flat plain, stand tall mountains 
with snow-capped peaks shining in the 
sun. \bur trail turns south and west, fol 
lowing the edge of Rcndwood and heading 
for a narrow strip of flatland between the 
woods and the mountains. \bu travel for 
another mile when, suddenly, 10 strange 
looking humanoid creatures clamber 
clumsily out of the brush ahead of you. 
With awkward swiftness they form a line 


17 









THE HALL OF ROCK 


across the trail, blocking your path. They 
look like living rainbows, their tall and 
thin bodies striped with red. blue, green, 
orange, yellow, brown, black and white 
Those closer to the trees of Rendwood are 
harder to see; they seem to blend right in 
with the forest. They wear loincloths, and 
carry long daggers. Each has a very small 
sack tied to his waist. One of the creatures 
holds up his broad hand. In halting Com 
mon. he says in a rasping voice, "This 
place is ours. Strangers pass only by leave 
of the Lord of Shade. Surrender your 
weapons and come with us. You cannot 
escape the judgment of the Omncrubcsk." 


The thin, awkward humanoids are chameleon 
men (AC 9; HD 2; hp 11,11,10,9.9.9.9.8, 
7. 6; /AT 1; D 1-4; MV 120' (40'): Save F2; 
SA disappearance; SD +2 initiative bonus; 
AL Neutral; XP 45 each). 

The chameleon men will wait for the reac 
tion of the player characters; they will not 
fight until the characters attack, try to force 
their way past the roadblock, or try to escape. 
If that happens, the chameleon men will dis 
play a very unusual power, five of the chame 
leon men will suddenly vanish and reappear 
behind the characters, cutting off any retreat: 
the other five in front will charge the party, 
ready to attack. When combat is joined, the 
attacking chameleon men will vanish and 
reappear off to the left or right of the character 
attacked; this "vanishing move" gives the 
chameleon men +2 on initiative die tolls. 
They will use this vanishing move every com 
bat round. There is no chance of chameleon 
men colliding with characters ot with each 
other. 

Throughout the battle, the chameleon men 
will call on the party to surrender or be killed 
for trespassing. If a chameleon man is killed, 
he will fall to the ground like a heap of old 
rags. When there is only one chameleon man 
left, he will vanish, but not reappear (unless 
he is killed before he can escape). 

If the bodies of the dead chameleon men 
are searched after the battle, the characters 
will find 20 cp. 10 gp. and 2 pp on each. 

If the player characters agree to surrender, 
the chameleon men will disarm them and rake 
them, blindfolded and bound, to the moun 
tain cavern of the chameleon men, encounter 
W5. If the characters defeat the chameleon 
men, ignore encounter W5. 


W5. THE CAVERN OF THE 
CHAMELEON MEN 


The chameleon men disarm you, and ban 
dage your wounds. All of you are blind 
folded. and your hands are bound behind 
you. You for what seems that a long time, 
but you cannot tell how long or how far. 
When your blindfolds arc removed, you 
sec that you are in a cave 60' long and 30' 
wide, with the entrance in the 30' side. 
There are two torches, in brackets, on each 
wall. Daylight shines outside the cave's 
entrance. Two chameleon men stand guard 
within the cave. 


The two guards in the cave are named 
Kanrcon and Thronik (AC 9; HD 2; hp 11,9; 
/AT 1; D 1-4; MV 120' (40'); Save F2; SA dis 
appearance; SD + 2 on initiative die rolls; ML 
7; ALNeutral;XP4>). Two additional chame 
leon men (hp 9. 7) stand guard outside the 
cave. Kanrcon and Thronik will not be hos 
tile; they will even talk with the party, if any 
character wishes to talk with them. Allow the 
characters to speak with Kanrcon and Thronik 
as long as they like. When they are finished, 
Kanrcon leaves and talks to the Omnembesk 
for a half-hour. When Kanrcon returns, he 
and Thronik will take the characters into the 
main cavern to be judged. 


The cavern is hundreds of feet wide and at 
least forty feet high; you cannot tell how 
long it is. Sunlight streams into the cavern 
from shafts cleverly cut into the rocky ceil 
ing, and from these slices in the rock the 
sunlight fills the cavern. You know you are 
far underground, for the air is chilly, and 
no wind stirs. Veins of precious metal and 
gem-bearing ores stripe the walls of the 
cavern like rocky rainbows. The floor of the 
cavern is filled with many different kinds 
of vegetable growth, from mushrooms as 
tail as houses to rainbow-colored trees that 
touch the very ceiling of the cavern. A 
waterfall roars in the distance, and you can 
catch a glimmer of it as the cleverly 
directed sunlight dances on its tumbling 
waters. The inhabitants of the cavern are 
tilling soil, picking fruit, and running 
errands-a typical day in the life of the 
chameleon people. 

You arc led into a small chamber off the 
mam cavern. In the small chamber, a cha 
meleon man sits on a throne carved from 
the rock itself. The stripes on his skin arc 


faded with age. and he bears himself with 
dignity. Twenty armed guards protect him. 
He gazes silently at you, and Kanrcon 
introduces him as Lcmullar the Omncru- 
besk. Lord of Shade and Hue. 


The Omnenjbesk(AC9; HD 4; hp 21; /AT 1; 
D unarmed; MV 120'(40'); Save F4; ML9; SA 
disappearance; SD + 2 on initiative die rolls; 
AL Neutral; XP 90) and his twenty spear- 
armed guards (AC 9; HD 2; hp 9 each; /AT 1; 
D 1-6; MV 120' (40'); Save F2; ML 7; SA dis 
appearance; SD +2 on initiative die rolls: AL 
Neutral; XP 45 each) never speak. Kanrcon 
does all the talking for Lcmullar; the 
Omncrubcsk merely nods his head to show 
approval or disapproval of what is being said 
by both the characters and Kanrcon. 


You stand for a few silent seconds in the 
middle of the cavern. Then Lcmullar ges 
tures. and Kanrcon speaks. "You were in 
our territory without the prior approval of 
the Omncrubcsk. This is a crime and an 
insult against our people. But the 
Omncrubcsk is generous; he offers you a 
chance to win yout freedom. You have two 
choices: you can cither pay a fine for what 
you have done, or one of you can duel one 
of our people in single combat. 


The chameleon men demand that the party 
pay 80-180 gp (2d6 + 6 x 10) for each chame 
leon man killed in the previous encounter. 
Characters may try to bargain, but the mini 
mum the chameleon men will accept is 70-120 
gp (ld6 +6 x 10). If this price is still too high 
for the characters to pay, the chameleon men 
will accept one player character as a hostage 
until the rest of the party gets enough money 
to pay the fine. All characters except the hos 
tage will be freed. The hostage will be kept as 
an honored prisoner and will not be mistreat 
ed. The hostage will be released when the par 
ty returns with enough money to pay the fine. 

If the characters are unable or unwilling to 
pay a fine and unwilling to allow a character to 
be held prisoner, a character must fight in sin 
gle combat. Allow them as much time as they 
need to decide. If they choose combat. 
Kanrcon explains further: 


This will be an "honor duel." an old way of 
settling disputes among our people. The 
two combatants will fight with duelling 
clubs that only wound, not kill. You will be 
allowed to wear armor. No spells or magic 


18 









THE HALL OF ROCK 


axe permitted for you. Nor can anyone else 
interfere in the honor duel. If you defeat 
our champion, you will be set free. If you 
lose, one of you will remain as hostage 
until the others return to pay the fine. 
Which one of you will be the champion? 


After the characters choose their champion, 
they will be led out to an arena area 30' square 
in the main cavern. The arena is guarded by 
10 of Lemullar's guards and is surrounded by 
spectators. When the chameleon champion 
(AC 9; HD 2; hp 12; #AT 1; D 1-4; MV 120' 
(40'); Save F2; SA disappearance. SD +2 on 
initiative die rolls; ML 12; AL N) appears, 
there is a rousing cheer. The player character 
chosen as champion will be untied, and the 
two will fight it out. The chameleon champi 
on will use his disappearing powers while the 
character is allowed armor. The chameleon 
champion will nOt surrender. The clubs cause 
ld4 points of damage, but are not lethal 
Anyone who is reduced to 0 hit points is 
unconscious, not killed. An unconscious char 
acter will revive in 2d 10 minutes, and damage 
caused by the club will heal at the rate of 1 
point per hour. 

Whatever the outcome, the chameleon 
men will take the party back blindfolded and 
tied up to the place they first met (encounter 
location W4). If the characters left a hostage 
behind, the chameleon men will watch daily 
for the party's return. 

W6. THE STONE BRIDGE 


The land on both sides of the trail is hard 
and rocky. Jagged boulders and sharp 
stones litter the ground. The trail remains 
smooth, however, and you have no trouble 
riding along it. A swift-flowing river 
crosses your trail, spanned by a bridge 
made of dull gray stone. An arch made of 
the same stone stands at the mouth of the 
bridge. Odd runes are carved into the arch. 
The runes are ancient, yet somehow fami- 
lar. Beyond the bridge the trail leads into a 
small stand of trees, which blocks your 
view of the terrain beyond it. 


The bridge is guarded by two monsters placed 
long ago by the magicians of Tuma. Charac 
ters can cross the bridge safely only if they per 
form a simple ceremony known by all the 
people of Tuma. The arch was built as a warn 
ing to all who would try to cross. The charac 
ters will have to fight the guardians unless 
they decipher the runes and guess what they 


must do. 

The inscription is in an ancient form of the 
common language. A character who casts a 
read languages spell can automatically read 
the runes. However, it is possible to read the 
runes without using magic. If a character tries 
to read the runes without using a spell, roll 
3d6 and subtract 1. If the result is equal to or 
lower than the Intelligence ability of the char 
acter. the character can read the inscription. If 
the roll is higher than the Intelligence ability, 
the character cannot understand the runes. 
Each player is allowed only one try at deci 
phering the inscription without magic. The 
runes read: "Let no man cross the bridge with 
out first giving to the water that which is its 
due." 

All dwarf, elf, halfling, and female human 
characters can safely cross the bridge. How 
ever. a male human character can cross safely 
only if he pours some waicr into the river 
when he steps onto the bridge. If he tries to 
cross without doing this, the guardians of the 
bridge will attack. 

The guardians are two snake-shaped water 
weirds (AC 5: HD 3*; hp 14, 12; #AT 1; D 
1 + drowning; MV 60' (20') in water only; 
Save F6; ML 12; AL Chaotic.) They attack 
from both sides of the bridge, one per side, 
and they attack only human males and any 
other characters who attack them. They will 
also fight any character that tries to stop them 
from attacking the human males. 

Any character who is hurt by a water weird 
will be able to read the runes on the arch auto 
matically, even if the character had tried to 
read them before and failed. If such a charac 
ter tries to read the inscription, read the fol 
lowing: 


The arch, which was dull gray, is now as 
blue as the river and the strange monsters! 
\bu can now read the mysterious runes on 
the arch! They read. "Let no man cross the 
bridge without first giving to the water 
that which is its due." 


When destroyed, the water weirds lose their 
snake shapes and collapse into the river as a 
spray of water. They have no treasure. 

W7. THE STEALTHY 
CRAFTSMAN 


The trail narrows as you enter the rugged 
foothills of the Barkcl Mountains. The trail 
sometimes winds or slopes upward. but the 
going is still fairly easy. After a few minutes 


of travel through this rugged landscape, 
you hear the quiet movement of someone 
or something else in the rocks about forty 
yards to your right. There is definitely 
something moving, something that does 
not want to be seen. 


A character who goes into the rocks to inves 
tigate hears the creature run briefly, then stop. 
After five rounds, the creature begins moving 
again. This game of cat-and-mouse continues 
for 5 rounds. At that point, roll for surprise. If 
the party surprises the opponent, they will see 
him as he runs between two rocks. If the oppo 
nent is not surprised, he will come out of hid 
ing unless the party has tried to use spells or 
missile weapons on him. Before he shows 
himself, he shouts. "Don't shoot! I'm coming 
out!" 


You see a middle-aged dwarf with an iron- 
gray beard emerge. He is wearing a hooded 
brown cloak that matches the terrain. He 
does not seem to be waring armor, and his 
only weapon is a hammer. He has a small 
sack and a large chisel thrust into his belt. 


The dwarf s name is Dunnark Ironhammer, 
(AC 9; Dw 3; hp 18; MV 60' (20'); #AT 1; D 
1-4; Save Dw 3; ML 8; AL I; XP 35) and he is 
the armorer for a small clan of dwarves living 
in the Krayzcn Mountains. He is here to mine 
some semi-precious gems (value 10 gp each) 
he uses to decorate the weapons and armor he 
makes. The gem vein is in a surface layer of 
rock; he simply chisels them out. He was mov 
ing through the rocks to lead the characters 
away from the gem vein; the characters will 
not be able to find it. Dunnak left most of the 
gems in a secure hiding place that only he can 
find, but he is carrying four of the gems with 
him. 

If the party attacks, run the combat normal 
ly. Dunnak will surrender if he fails a morale 
check. 

If the party docs not attack, Dunnak will be 
friendly and apologize for frightening the par 
ty, saying, "I had to be sure I'd be all right 
before I showed myself." Dunnak will not 
admit why he is here, saying that he is an 
adventurer himself. He offers to drink with 
the characters, and challenges a fighter (or 
dwarf, if there is one in the party) to a 
weapon-throwing contest. If the party agrees, 
he bets his gems against the party's money. Let 
the players decide ho the contest will be run. 
as long as it is fair to both. If the character 
wins, Dunnark pays up cheerfully. 


19 










THE HALL OF ROCK 


If the characters ask him about The Rock, 
Dunnark says only, "I've never been there, 
but I've heard that going there is a bad idea." 
The DM decides if the dwarf will or will not 
accompany the party following this encounter 
(he should not unless the party is weak). 

THE END OF THE TRAIL 


You'tc approaching the end of your jour 
ney. Jcnlar Temlin s map indicates that The 
Rock is less than rwo miles away. Barring 
any trouble, you should reach The Rock 
soon. The trail slowly bends until it is 
heading due north. About a half-mile 
from the bridge, the trail ends in a tangle 
of boulders and rubble. Ahead of you lies a 
land filled with huge boulders and thou 
sands of rocks of every size and shape. 


During the final battle, the defenders of 
Tuma caused avalanches and tockslides here, 
to slow the advance of the evil armies. The 
rubble has been partially cleared. Movement 
through here is still possible, although it will 
take the characters three hours to exit the 
square in which the trail ends. They will have 
to dismount and lead their horses, as this area 
is strewn with small sharp rocks that could 
injure a horse's hooves. After a slow journey 
through the mountains the patty will arrive at 
The Rock, 

After their various trials and battles, the party 
has reached its destination-The Rock itself. 
However, to gain entry to The Rock, they 
must first defeat the defenders. The patty's 
true goal is obtaining the talisman hidden 
within The Rock. Evil spells prevent anyone 
native to Tuma (like Lirdrium Arkayz) from 
entering The Rock; this is the reason Arkayz 
was forced to hire the party. However, if the 
characters gain the talisman, Arkayz will know 
immediately, and the party will magically van 
ish and reappear at The Manor, their mission 
complete. 

The Rock is defended by elaborate illu 
sions. If the characters recognize this, their 
final battle will be much easier. 

Rl. CRONE OF CHAOS 


You stand before a solitary peak in the cen 
ter of a plain one-half mile square. Your 
hearts tell you this is yout goal, this is The 
Rock. This mighty pillar of stone is 150' 
tall from the base to its flat summit. The 
base is roughly rectangular, 50' wide on its 


northern and southern sides, and only 15' 
wide on the east and west sides. The Rock 
becomes more circular near the summit. 
The sides of the peak are steep, and it 
would be difficult to climb them, if possi 
ble at all. You ride closer and see a lovely 
young woman chained to The Rock. Her 
clothing is purple and yellow, but frayed 
and tattered; her golden hair is dirty, and 
she wears a tarnished silver tiara. Her face 
is blotched with grime, her features pale 
and drawn with pain and loneliness. In a 
shrill voice she shouts to you. "Flee for 
your lives! An old hag who loathes my 
beauty has imprisoned me here until 1 die, 
old and ugly. Flee before she returns to 
punish you for daring to come near me!" 


The party is confronted with the first of the 
evil illusions that guard The Rock, for the 
seeming "damsel in distress" is actually an 
inhuman monster, the Crone of Chaos (AC 7; 
HD 6*; hp 20; MV 120' (40'); #AT2; D 1-6/ 
1-6; SA magical attack; Save F6: ML 12; AL 
Chaotic; XP 500). The crone uses the illusion 
to disguise her true repulsive appearance. She 
is magically aware of all who approach The 
Rock, so the characters will see the disguised 
crone regardless of which side they approach 
from. 

The crone is not a true magic-user or cleric, 
but she has several magical attacks she will use 
on the party, in the order given below. She 
maintains the illusion of herself as bound and 
helpless until the final attack. The magical 
attacks are not cast in the way that normal 
spells are, and the illusion prevents anyone 
from knowing that the crone is responsible for 
them (although anyone using a detect magic 
spell will see that there is some kind of magic 
in the area where the woman stands). To fur 
ther deceive the characters, the young woman 
will call piteously for help and shout encour 
agement to the player characters. 

Animal Control. The crone can control all 
normal and giant animals automatically (no 
saving throw). She causes the characters' 
horses to throw their riders and tun away Any 
horse without a rider will also run. A character 
thrown to the ground must spend the next 
round getting up and cannot attack. While 
characters are getting up. the crone uses her 
second attack. 

Daggers of Sorcery. This attack causes a 
ghostly white dagger to appear in the air 
before each character and attack by itself. The 
attack looks as if the daggers were wielded by 
invisible hands. A dagger moves on its own 
and keeps up with a character as the character 


moves until either the dagger or the character 
is destroyed. If a character was shown from his 
horse in the previous round, the attacking 
dagger automatically has initiative and a + 2 
bonus "to hit" as the character gets up. The 
daggers arc magical constructs; they can be 
attacked and destroyed in the same way as liv 
ing creatures. Each dagger has the following 
characteristics: AC 2; hp 1; #AT 1; D 1-4; Save 
Fl. Any hit scored by a character destroys a 
dagger 

As each dagger is destroyed, all characters 
who fought that dagger must roll a saving 
throw vs. Spells. Those characters failing then 
rolls become dizzy and weak for 6 rounds (- 2 
on Hit Rolls and saving throw rolls). Charac 
ters who make successful saving throws arc 
unaffected. 

The Crone Revealed. After the last of the four 
is destroyed, the form of the young captive 
woman changes. In mete seconds, the beauti 
ful young woman becomes a withered, hid 
eous old woman with sparse white hair, 
leathery skin, fangs, long inhuman arms, and 
large hands with claw-like fingers. The crone 
will attack the character nearest her. 

The crone is a ancient creature, given 
unnaturally long life by the magic of the ene 
mies of Tuma. When they learned of the talis 
man and its power, they tried to destroy it and 
found that they could not. So they set warding 
spells over The Rock and placed this creature 
there as a guard She can exist only as long as 
the talisman remains in The Rock and would 
die if it were removed. She knows this, and is 
therefore the perfect guardian. 

If the characters examine the area of The 
Rock where the crone first stood, they see nar 
row crack in the rock. The crone stood in front 
of this through most of the battle. Examining 
the crack further, they find a golden sword 
wedged in the far end of the crack. This is The 
Sword of The Rock, a magical sword + 2 that 
cannot be used by evil creatures. Along the 
blade of the sword the following words arc 
written in the common tongue: "Broad and 
wide the path to nowhere; thin and narrow 
the way to true riches. Unravel the riddle the 
riches to win." Either write these words down 
for the players to read, or read them for the 
players to hear. If you choose to read them, 
repeat them whenever the characters ask, for 
the characters will have the sword with them 
and will be able to read the words whenever 
they please. 

The riddle's meaning is that The Rock can 
be entered through cither of its narrow sides, 
east or west. The entrances are hidden by pow 
erful illusions; no character will find a secret 
door or a magical door; detect magic will not 


20 






THE HALL OF ROCK 


penetrate the illusion. But a mere placing of 
the hand on cither the eastern or western face 
of The Rock will result in the hand passing 
through solid stone. The northern and south 
ern exposures are only rock, and any character 
touching these faces will feel only stone. The 
party cannot take their horses into The Rock. 

When the party discovers how to enter The 
Rock, go to encounter R2. 

R2. THE HALL OF THE ROCK 


The stone is not solid! Anything that 
touches this side of The Rock passes 
through as if through air! Is this the 
entrance you seek, or yet another deadly 
trap? 


When the characters gather their courage and 
enter The Rock, continue with the descrip 
tion. 


You find yourselves in a large hall 380' long 
and 240' wide. The hall is brightly lit, as if 
the light of- the noon sun were shining 
down into it. The walls are 50' high, and 
from there the ceiling curves upward until 
it is approximately 350 feet high overhead. 
You stand in the center of the hall, looking 
forward. At the far end of the hall you see 
four raised platforms on the floor, grouped 
in two pain, and seven chests between the 
pairs of platforms. Each platform has a 
statue of a crowned king on it. The walls of 
the hall are made of white marble filigreed 
with gold and silver in various natural 
forms: trees, flowen, wildlife, clouds; and 
human life: warrion, builden raising cit 
ies. market place scenes, etc. Letten of sil 
ver and gold are etched into the floor in 
front of you. They read, HUBREL1S 
TUMASSEN. To your left, the hall seems 
to be run-down and battered, as if time 
and weather had eroded the splendor of 
that side. The right side of the hall, how 
ever, glows and sparkles with beauty and 
wonder, as if it were still newly made. You 
stand in a group at the very heart of this 
magnificent hall! 


This hall is too large to be the inside of The 
Rock that was seen from the outside; in truth. 
The Rock is merely a concealed magical portal 
lead leads to this hall, which once held all the 
greatest treasures of Tuma. 

The words. HUBREUS TUMASSEN. are 
written in a style similar to the inscription on 
the arches of the Stone Bridge. A character can 
read them automatically with a read languag 


es, or can read them if the character's Intelli 
gence is high. When a character tries to read 
the words, roll 3d6 and subtract 1. If the result 
is equal to or less than the character's Intelli 
gence, he or she can understand the words. 
When translated, they read, "THE GREAT 
PRIDE OF TUMA." 

Now that the party has finally reached The 
Rock, there are 2 possible conclusions for this 
module, each one depending on the strength 
of the party when it reaches The Rock. The 
party may have all its original members, but 
each character may have only a fraction of 
original hit points left; the party may be 
small, but with each character left alive having 
all original hit points; or the party may be 
large and strong, or small and weak. What 
ever the case. Journey to The Rock provides 
two endings: one for a strong party, and one 
for a weak party. Ending A will describe what a 
strong party encounters in the Hall of The 
Rock; Ending B will detail what a weak party 
encounters. As DM, you choose the ending 
that is appropriate for your players. 

Give the players their copy of the Hall of 
The Rock Map. 

ENDING A 

In this ending, the player characters will have 
to fight the kings of ancient Tuma, all statues 
that arc far more than they seem at first. 

The statues on the platforms are living 
statues made to resemble the kings of the 
ancient city of Tuma. Although each is made 
of white marble and looks like a normal, non- 
magical statue, the four have the powers and 
statistics of the type of living statue it is. Liv 
ing statues normally attack with their fists and 
get two attacks per round. These kingly living 
statues, however, will attack with weapons 
instead. The weapon each carries is the weap 
on that the king, a mighty fighter, gained 
fame with in life. As long as they use their 
weapons, each living statue will get only one 
attack per round. If by some means a statue 
loses its weapon, it will then strike twice per 
round, as a normal living statue does. 

Although these living statues are powerful 
opponents, they have a secret weakness that a 
lucky player character may discover. The magic 
that animates each of these living statues is in the 
crown that each same wears. If a character rolls a 
"20" on the die when rolling "to hit" for a mis 
sile or melee anack. the blow has knocked the 
crown off the statue's head. The statue immedi 
ately stops attacking and becomes immobile. If a 
character is foolish enough to replace the crown 
on the statue's head, the statue will animate and 
attack again! 


The crown also determines the type of liv 
ing statue each is. For example, a starue with 
an iron crown is treated as an iron living 
statue. 

In addition to its special weakness, each 
statue can be destroyed normally in combat, 
as with any other living statue. 

Read the following description to the party 
when they get within 90' of any platform or 
any chest. Once the characters arc within 90* 
the statues will animate and attack. They con 
tinue to attack even if the party retreats. 


As you approach the platforms and the 
chests, you can see the royal statues more 
clearly The platforms arc the pedestals for 
each statue. The king on the left is the old 
est of the four, the one next to him is youn 
ger. the two on the right are younger still. 
Perhaps they are a dynasty, a family of 
kings. All of them have a proud and noble 
appearance, as if each fully deserved to 
wear a crown..,. 

Wait! Suddenly the statues move! Their 
heads turn slowly as they survey you with 
sightless eyes. Each raises a weapon as if to 
salute you and welcome you to this great 
hall. Then, to your horror, you realize that 
the salute is a challenge to you all. for the 
kings are stepping off their platforms and 
moving toward you! 


The following paragraphs describe each kingly 
statue, kbu can give the physical description 
of the statue to any player character who is 
fighting that statue. 

King Alcidaxes. This statue is of an old 
man, full of years and wisdom. His face is 
lined with the worries of kingship, and even 
his graven eyes seem to show sadness. He 
wears a plain iron crown, with no decoration. 
His weapon is a mighty battle axe. King Alci 
daxes has the abilities of an iron living statue 
(AC 2; HD 4*; hp 12; MV 30* (10'); #AT 1 
(with axe) or 2; D 1-8 (with axe) + special or 
1-8/1-8 + special; Save F4; ML 11; AL Neu 
tral; XP 125). Attackers with non-magical 
metal weapons must make a saving throw ver 
sus Spells when the statue is hit; failure means 
that the weapon is stuck until the statue is 
killed. If Alcidaxes' crown is knocked off, 
stuck weapons can be removed. The Sword of 
The Rock will not get stuck in Alcidaxes' 
body. 

King Bclkaiar. This king has a serene, hap 
py, expression on his face, as though he was at 
peace with himself and with the world. The 
statue is carved to show a holy symbol around 
the king's neck. His crown is of granite, carved 


21 





THE HALL OF ROCK 


to look like a circular city wall. His weapon is a 
mace. King Belkazar had the abilities of a rock 
living statue (AC 4, HD 5*: hp 15; MV 60' 
(20'): #AX 1 (with mace) or 2; D 1-6 (with 
mace)or 2-12/2-12; Save F5; ML 11; ALCha 
otic; XP 300). A rock living statue normally 
attacks by shooting magma from his fingers. 
King Belkazar will not do this as long as he has 
his mace. 

King Calobanes. This king is young, and 
has a carefree, happy expression on his face. 
He looks like a young man who has learned 
how to enjoy life. His crown is of quartz crys 
tal, with agates, and semi-precious stones set 
in it. His weapon is a long dagger. King Calo- 
banes has the abilities of a crystal living statue 
(AC 4; HD 3; hp 9; MV 90' (30'); #AT 1 (with 
dagger) or 2; D 1-4 (with dagger) or 1-6/1-6; 
Save F3; ML 11; AL Lawfol; XP 35). 

King Delophenes. This king is obviously 
the brother of King Calobanes, and the two 
look about the same age. Closer examination 
reveals that they are twins, but where Calo- 
banes was fun-loving and carefree, 
Deiophanes looks studious and somber. His 
weapon is a long dagger. King Deiophanes has 
the abilities of a crystal living statue (AC 4; 
HD 3; hp 9; MV 90' (30'); #AT 1 (with dag 
ger) or 2; D 1-4 (with dagger)or 1-6/1-6; Save 
F3; ML 11; AL Lawful; XP 35). 

If all three statues arc slain, they will crum 
ble into powder, leaving the party with the 
weapons and crowns of the statues. If the par 
ty examines the pedestals from which the 
statues came, they find the name of the king 
engraved on each pedestal. From further 
inscriptions on the pedestals, they Icam the 
following: 

Alcidaxcs was the father of Belkazar. 
Calobanes and Deiophanes were Belkazar's 
sons. Each of them passed suffered in life 
because they were foolish and made bad 
judgements in time of crisis. 

The only treasure the kings have is their 
crowns. If a dwarf or other character wants to 
know how valuable each is, estimate that each 
is worth approximate 1000 gp. This is another 
illusion, for the crowns were made to reflect 
the king's splendor. When the crowns arc 
removed from the Hall of The Rock, each is 
worth only 50 gp. 

ENDING B 


The chests against the wall with the balco 
nies are all made of wood; but the first is a 
simply constructed chest while the 7th is 


richly decorated with gems and silver and 
gold metalwork. The chests also vary in 
decoration so that the first is the simplest 
chest and the last is the most ornate. 


Having read the description of the Hall of The 
Rock to the players, describe the the appear 
ance of the seven chests to the characters, 
using the description supplied above. After 
this, divide the party into two groups, one 
having the highest Wisdom and one having 
the lowest Wisdom, without telling them how 
the division is made. Take the group with 
lower Wisdom aside and privately read them 
the following description: 


You hear quiet voices calling to you. They 
tell you to look at the glorious side of the 
hall, saying, "This is Tuma! This is the 
greatness that was once lost but can now be 
yours. For long years its glory has waited 
for bold adventurers like yourselves to 
come and claim chat which your daring 
and bravery has earned you. This is yours 
by right of valor, by might of arms, by 
sleight of hand and by keenness of mind. 
Others have tried, but they have failed- 
all because they would not take the riches 
they had earned. Come. now. Take your 
due. The wealth of Tuma is yours; you 
deserve it more than any other. Behold the 
folly of those who have ignored Tuma's 
greatness! See the worn and weary section 
of this great hall! It has been brought so 
low by fools who mistook poverty for 
humility, simplicity for piety, who called 
wealth and riches greed and avarice. These 
fools thought honor meant lowering one's 
self when one should have elevated one's 
greatness Do not be a fool! Let the trum 
pet of your true worth ring out! The great 
deserve the best! The bravest demand the 
finest! Ybu have made it to The Rock; do 
not walk away empty-handed, a paupet 
forever! Be not a fool; be not a fool!" 


fry to be as persuasive as possible in order that 
the characters truly believe the words of the 
soft voices. 

To the other group, the ones with the high 
est Wisdom, say nothing except the previous 
description of the hall, except to call their 
attention again to the glorious side of the hall. 
This is not the proper choice, for the chest 
containing the treasure of Tuma and the 
Secret of The Rock is not the fanciest chest, 
but the simplest. Having tried to sway the par 
ty towards the richer side of the hall, read the 


following to the players. 


You stand gazing at the seven chests lining 
the wall beneath the balconies. The first 
chest is elegant in its sheer simplicity, but 
each succeeding chest surpasses it in value 
and design. The last chest is by far the best 
of the lot. Its jewels sparkle in the mysteri 
ous light of the hall; its gold and silver glit 
ter with light. And then, from nowhere, a 
deep, rich voice calls out to welcome you to 
the Hall of The Rock. "\ou are indeed 
brave heroes to have reached this great 
Hall! To you a reward shall be given for 
your great courage. In one of these seven 
chests lies the goal of your journey, and 
much more! But you can choose only one 
of these chests and must be content with 
what you find. You have done well thus 
far, choose well and your journey shall be a 
success. What you have experienced on the 
way here will prove to be a guide beyond 
measure. Think, then, and choose; think 
and choose!" The voice falls silent, and 
you arc left with only your thoughts. 

The voice's reference to "experiences on the 
way here" is meant to get the party to reflect 
on how appearances have b"n deceptive 
throughout the journey. Now the characters 
must use their wits instead of their muscles. 

For Ending B. the fighting mentioned on 
the golden sword refers to the battle to make 
the right decision. If the party is being overly 
suspicious or paranoid, explain this interpre 
tation of the sword's riddle to them. But this 
interpretation applies only to Ending B; in 
Ending A the fighting is quite literal. 

There is only one chest that the party can 
choose in order to be successful in learning the 
secret of The Rock, and that one chest is the 
first chest, the simple, wooden chest. Should 
the party select any other chest, the voice will 
shout out in an angry tone: "Foolish, greedy 
creatures! You dare presume to discover the 
Secret of The Rock! Never shall so great a 
secret be learned by the likes of you! Begone! 
Nothing have you learned from your trouble 
some journey here! Begone and bother this 
place no more!" The hall will then fade from 
view, and the characters will find themselves 
outside The Rock and facing a perilous jour 
ney back to the Manor. 

Failure in this quest produces some very 
interesting results. If the party had been cap 
tured by the chameleon men and had struck 
an agreement, then payment will still have to 
be made. If the payment is too much less than 
what the party had promised, then you will 


22 







INTERLUDE B 


have to choose what is to be done. At the vety 
best, the party will be forbidden passage 
along the trail and will have to return to the 
Manor by another way. 

But this happens only if the wrong chest is 
chosen. If the party picks the right chest, the 
following will occur. The wooden chest will 
not be locked even though it appears to be 
locked; all the other chests are locked in fact. 
Upon opening the wooden chest the charac 
ters will find these items within it: 100 pp; 
1,500 gp; 4 gold wristbands worth 100 gp 
each; a ring of protection +i; 2 potions of 
healing a rope of climbing: 2 daggers +1; and 
a curiously fashioned talisman that looks like a 
capital T with a short diagonal stem hanging 
off the tight side of the crossbar of the T. At 
the tip of the diagonal stem there is a small 
red stone, not a ruby, and whose wonh can't 
be estimated by any character. When the con 
tents of the chest have been thoroughly exam 
ined, the voice will again cry out to the party. 

"Well done, brave heroes! To you shall the 
secret of The Rock be revealed. And this be 
that greatest of secrets: A soul falls into judge 
ment when a soul climbs high enough to sit in 
judgement's seat; judge not by what is seen, 
but by what is truly there. Let the eyes of the 
heart guide and counsel the eyes of the body. 
Glitter does not make a golden prize, hidden 
in the heart the answer lies. How a creature 
looks never changes what's inside. Judge with 
righteous judgement; be wise. Be wise!" 

The talisman in the chest is magically intelli- 
gient. and it is the source of the mysterious 
voices. The Hall of the Rock is intended to 
deceive foolish or greedy adventurers and 
keep them from obtaining the talisman. The 
talisman will activate the magical portal when 
the party tries to open a chest, but the charac 
ters will have enough time to collect the trea 
sure (if they choose the correct chest). If they 
made the wrong choice, they will not have a 
second chance to re-enter the Hall of The 
Rock; the talisman will keep the magical por 
tal closed. 

Payment due the chameleon men, had the 
party been forced into a bargain, will be taken 
from the total of treasure gathered from the 
stan of the game, not from where the party 
met the chameleon men. If a set price had 
been the bargain, then the characters have no 
problems; if the price was a percentage of the 
treasure found, then the players will have to 
work this out. 


RETURNING TO THE MANOR 

After the party has settled accounts with the 
chameleon men (if necessary), Lirdrium 
Arkayz will find the characters (wherever they 
are) and magically return them to the Manor 
of Lirdriam Arkayz. Jenlar Temlin will come 
down the wide steps to ask if the journey has 
been successful; he will ask for the Secret of 
The Rock. The Secret consists of the Talis 
man's last words to the characters. If someone 
recites the Secret, Jenlar Temlin smiles and 
says: 


You have indeed done well, but the Secret 
of The Rock is a twofold secret. What else 
have you brought back from your journey 
to The Rock?" 


He will, in essence, be asking for the strange 
talisman. If the characters are at a loss to 
understand what Jenlar means, he will ask 
outright for the talisman with the large T on 
it. When given the talisman, Jenlar will bow, 
and give each character the reward they nego 
tiated at the begining of the adventure. If the 
characters arc curious about the talisman or 
The Rock, Jenlar says: 


Master Arkayz is engaged in secret labor 
and the talisman is necessary for the work's 
completion. It was to have been his long 
ago, and you have restored it to him. The 
Secret of The Rock is wisdom you may ben 
efit from in the future. I am glad that you 
have succeeded where so many others have 
failed. This bodes a bright future for ail of 
you. 


If the party entered The Hall of The Rock but 
failed to obtain the talisman. Jenlar will be 
unconcerned, since Lirdrium will be able to 
obtain the talisman by other means. He 
praises the bravery of the player characters , 
saying that no one else has done as well. 

The party can then leave or spend the night 
at the Manor and set out for Threshold the fol 
lowing day. 


This interlude links the Hall of Rock adven 
ture to the Great Escape. A side trip to the 
Caverns of Quasqueton is also possible, if you 
wish to prepare that adventure. 

As the characters return to Threshold from 
the manor of the mage Arkayz, they will find 
an old man with a staff camped on the trail. If 
they talk to him. they will leant his story of the 
Black Eagle Barony. 

The old man claims to be Anton Turino. a 
spy in the service of Duke Stefan He has been 
seeking evidence that Baron Hendriks is caus 
ing unrest in the Duchy by secretly sponsoring 
goblin raids along the western border. He has 
learned that spies from the Black Eagle Barony 
are everywhere. He is meeting a contact with 
the final proof he needs to expose the plot at 
Lone Tree Hill, a day's ride east of Luln, how 
ever, there is a problem. He can't take the 
proof to Spccularum personally and needs 
help. The job doesn't pay anything, but when 
he talks to the Duke, he will arrange for the 
Duke to grant them a personal favor. 

The story is a complete lie. Anton is an agent 
for Baron Hendriks whose job is rooting out 
threats to the Baron There haven't been any for 
awhile, and Anton has devised this plan to make 
himself look good. In fan, a goblin force, secret 
ly backed by the Baron, will shortly raid Luln. 
Anton wants to tnck the playets into going west, 
then turn them over to the Baron's men as cap 
tured spies. He has met them outside Threshold 
to avoid interference. 

If the party attacks and kills Anton, (fake a 
combat: Anton is AC 7 and dies on the fourth 
hit-he makes all saving throws and sleep will not 
work, further, he should not cause more than 10 
points of damage to the party) they will find a 
map marked with the note "Lone Tree Hill, meet 
soon." If you have stocked the Caverns of Quas 
queton. Anton will have a map to this location 
marked ''Quasqueton? Check later." 

This is a trap for players who take NPCs at 
face value. Anton has no identification or 
proof that his story is true. He will answer 
questions with questions and misdirection, 
pausing a moment before each evasion. His 
story has weak points (such as how he can talk 
to the Duke if he can't go to Spccularum). A 
detect evil spell will reveal his evil intentions 
toward the characters. There is no problem if 
the party refuses to go with Anton, he will just 
make another plan that doesn't involve them 

If the characters go with him (or decide to 
investigate around Luln on their own) go to 
the Great Escape Adventure. 

Bl Note: Module Bl. In Search of the 
Unknown featured a "Stock-your-own " com 
plex run by Rogahn. fighter ot renown, and 
Zelligar. a powerful mage. The maps to this 
adventure ate given on page 1 50.

THE GREAT ESCAPE 


Background 

Investigating rumors of goblin raids in the 
vicinity of Luln. the party's camp is surprised 
one night by a horde of goblins (arranged by 
Anton if he is there). Tell the players as DM 
that their characters will probably die if they 
resist, and kill characters whose players force 
the issue. (This is something of an intelligence 
test, unintelligent play will cost a character at 
this point. Obviously, characters who surren 
der should not be killed). If Anton is there, he 
will gloat about having caught agents of the 
Duke. The characters will be force marched 
several days to an outpost of the Barony. 

If the players complain that their capture 
was unfair, gently remind them that if adven 
turing was easy, anyone could do it-they 
can't always expect things to go their way- 
and that there were clues. They will have 
ample opportunity to escape and recover their 
equipment, if they play well. 

Notes for the Dungeon Master 

The party members start this adventure with 
no armor or weapons. The spell books of any 
magic users have been taken away. However, 
all spell casters in the party have memorized 
spells, and can cast them normally. All obvi 
ous magic items have been removed from all 
characters. There is a 20% chance that small, 
inobvious magic items (such as rings) may 
have been missed when the enemy soldiers 
searched their prisoners. 

Once the characters have escaped their cell, 
they can search for their equipment (stored in 
room 13) or attempt an immediate escape. If 
they escape without recovering their equip 
ment. and make it back to Luln. the townmis- 
tress Sascia will equip the party with 
non-magical weapons and armor (and possi 
bly a few scroll spells for magic users) so they 
can go back and clear out the enemy outpost. 
They can then recover their equipment. If this 
occurs, replace all the men and monsters that 
the party killed during then escape. The 
entire outpost will be on alert when the party 
returns, and surprise will be impossible. This 
has no great campaign effect: border skirmish 
es arc common. 

Rooms that are empty or in which someone 
is sleeping are considered dark unless the 
room has windows or the text specifically 
states the room is lit. Rooms that are occupied 
by people who are awake always have light, 
cither through a window or by a candle or lan 
tern. Doors are not locked unless the text spe 
cifically says otherwise, and open easily. 

The occupants of the outpost arc intelligent 


soldiers. They work together, and once the 
alarm is raised or the escaping prisoners are 
sighted, they pursue the party in the most 
efficient way possible. 

Remember, the players cannot map the 
outpost until (or unless) their characters find 
mapping implements and supplies. 

The corridors and hallways of the outpost 
will be empty for exactly 10 turns after the 
party escapes from room 1. After that, the 
men and women currently eating a meal in 
room 2 leave the dining room by ones and 
twos, with one group leaving every other turn. 
There is a 1 in 6 chance each turn that the par 
ty will have an encounter with 1 or 2 veterans 
(FI. AC 9. hp 7 each, dagger D 1-4. ML 8). 
The veterans will attempt to sound the alarm 
if they get initiative and arc not surprised. If 
the alarm is raised, the chance for an encount 
er increases to 3 in 6 each turn. If the party is 
already engaged in combat, there is a 1 in 6 
chance each melee round that 1 additional 
veteran arrives to join the fight. Monster sta 
tistics are given on page 28. 

1. PRISON CELL 


The flickering torchlight barely illumi 
nates the prison cell that you have occu 
pied for the past two days. Talking quietly 
amongst yourselves, you have pooled a pit 
ifully scant amount of information about 
your plight. You were captured by goblins 
and brought to this outpost, somewhere 
just beyond the Black Eagle border. You 
were blindfolded, herded through corri 
dors and finally shackled in leg irons in this 
narrow cell. 

It is important that you escape, and 
quickly. You have learned that a large raid 
ing force of goblins, backed by the Black 
Eagle Barony, will soon descend on Luln. 
The town must be warned. 

Once you were securely shackled, your 
blindfolds were removed, and you could 
see your surroundings. Your prison cell is 
about 20 feet wide and 80 feet long. Iron 
double doors, securely locked, are along 
one of the long walls. The leg irons arc 
attached to each other with a sturdy chain, 
about five feet long. The chain passes 
through a ring that is securely embedded 
in the floor of the cell. The torches that 
light the room arc in brackets high on the 
wall-too high for you to reach. 

You have heard human voices from time 
to time, but until this morning, the only 
creature you have seen is a large humanoid 


who bears a strong rcsemblencc to a hyena. 
He has brought you food and water three 
times each day. He is armed with a dagger 
and a mace, and carries a large key ring 
with several keys on it. He has muttered 
and complained in the common tongue 
because the commander has not let him 
tortute you. 

This morning, the human commander 
of the outpost and a visitor, a female offi 
cer from another Black Eagle unit, came 
into your cell and bragged about the trust 
ed Black Eagle agent, Anton Turino, hav 
ing captured you. He told the visitor that 
instead of being slain as spies, you are 
about to be taken to the slave markets of 
Fort Doom. There, you will have no hope 
of escape. 

If you are ever to sec your home again, 
you must act soon. Soon, it will be time for 
your noon meal... 


Give the players up to 10 minutes of real time 
to create a plan. If they decide on a plan in less 
than 10 minutes, the jailer arrives as soon as 
the plan is set. If the players have not finished 
their planning when their time is up. the jailer 
arrives anyway. When the jailer is about to 
enter the room, read the following: 


You hear heavy footsteps approach, and 
the sound of a key turning in the door. It is 
your jailer, coming with your noon meal. 
He enters alone, grumbling about some 
thing under his breath. He appears dis 
tracted. 


The jailer is a gnoll armed with a dagger and a 
mace. It carries a key ring with six keys on it. 
Only two are used in this adventure: one 
unlocks all the leg irons, and the other opens 
the prison door. 

The gnoll is not particularly bright, and will 
go along with any reasonably subtle trick, 
such as feigned illness on the part of a party 
member. If captured and threatened, it will 
cooperate with the party, but will look for the 
first opportunity to doublecross them. It 
knows the party's equipment is in room 13. 
but docs not have a key to that room. 

In order to give the party a fighting chance, 
the fust magic spell that any party member 
casts in this adventure automatically succeeds, 
even if the victim is entitled to a saving throw. 
This benefit only happens once for the entire 
party. 

If the party's plan does not succeed, the jail 
er leaves, talcing the noon meal with him. He 


24 








THE GREAT ESCAPE 


docs not report the escape attempt because he 
doesn't want to look bad. He returns with the 
evening meal, this time very alert. 

If the party does not escape within two days 
(six meals), a party of armed human guards 
escorts them out of their cell, and they arc tak 
en (in leg irons) to the Fort Doom. 

Any further escape attempt arc at the dis 
cretion of the DM (remember that magic users 
cannot re-leam spells without a spell book). 
One possible rescue is given at the end of this 
adventure in Interlude C. 

If the party escapes the room, read the fol 
lowing aloud: 


As you carefully peer out the door of your 
cell. you see a corridor stretching to the left 
and right. You hear the sounds of conversa 
tion and laughter coming from the left. In 
both directions you see branching corridors 
and several doors. 


2. KITCHEN AND COMMON 
DINING ROOM 

NOTE: There are two openings (no doors) 
leading into the dining room, and one door 
(closed) leading into the kitchen. If the party 
peers through either door into the dining 
room, read the following: 


\bu see a large room with many tables and 
benches. About 20 people are sitting at the 
tables; they are laughing, talking, and eat 
ing. Both women and men are present; all 
are dressed in leather armor and seem to be 
soldiers. There is an open kitchen in one 
section of the room; a door leads out of the 
kitchen. 


If the party opens the door into the kitchen, 
read the following: 


An open kitchen reveals a dining room 
beyond, filled with people. Two women 
arc preparing and serving a meal. A deli 
cious aroma of cooking meat comes from 
the kitchen. 


The two women in the kitchen and ten of the 
people seated at the table are non-combatant 
servants. The rest arc fighters wearing leather 
armor and armed with daggers. 

There are 6 male servants, 6 female ser 
vants. 8 veteran fighters (1st level fighters), 
and 2 warriors (2nd level fighters). Two of the 
veterans are women. Each of the warriors has a 
key to the armory (room 13). 


3. MEN'S COMMON QUARTERS 


This room contains a number of beds and 
wardrobes, a few chairs, and a couple of 
tables. It otherwise appears to be empty. 
There is an open doorway on the far side of 
the room. 


This room provides quarters for the male ser 
vants. There is no one here at the moment. 
Under one mattress can be found 12 sp and 14 
cp. Under a second matress can be found 6 sp 
and 13 cp. A third mattress conceals 8 sp and 6 
cp. A fourth holds 3 sp and 19 cp. 

4. MEN'S BATH 


This long, narrow room has an open door 
way at the far end. There arc several wood 
en tubs on the floor, and what looks like a 
stove in the middle of the room. The floor 
is wet. and there is a soap smell. The room 
appears to be empty. 


This room is a bath. The stove is used to heat 
water for the tubs. The room is currently emp 
ty. The floor is very slippery; any character 
searching here must roll his Dexterity or less, 
using 3d6, or slip on the floor and turn an 
ankle. A turned ankle cuts a character's move 
ment rate by half for ld6 turns. 

5. MEN'S DRESSING ROOM 

NOTE: The following description assumes the 
party enters this room from the east. If they 
enter from room 6. you must make the appro 
priate adjustments. The small cntranceway to 
the cast of this room is currently empty. Both 
doors are swinging doors, and can easily be 
pushed open. 


The left wall of this long, narrow room 
seems to be a curtain. The right wall is 
lined with pegs. One of the pegs has some 
clothing on it. There is a basket near the far 
end of the room that has some cloth things 
on it. Otherwise, the room appears to be 
empty. 


This area is used by the men to change clothes 
before using the bath or the exercise room 
(room 6). The curtain has several gaps 
through which one can enter room 6. The 
clothing belongs to the man in room 6, and 
includes leather armor and a belt with a dag 
ger. The basket is filled with wet towels. 


6. MEN'S EXERCISE ROOM 

NOTE: The following description assumes the 
party enters this room from the south. If they 
come from room 5. make die appropriate 
adjustments. 


This looks like a work-out room. There are 
mats on the floor, weights, and other 
equipment. A man dressed only in short 
pants is doing push-ups near a rack in the 
near left comer of the room. 


This man is a veteran (1st level fighter) He is 
AC 8 because of good dexterity. When he sees 
the party, he grabs a weight from the rack and 
uses it like a mace (D 2-7, due to strength). He 
is too far from the dining room to call to the 
others, but he fights as best he can. He runs to 
alert the others if he can.

water for the tubs. The room is currently emp

fire pit, with branding irons resting in the 
ashes of an earlier fire. The room contains a 
rack and two wicked-looking whips (D 1-2).

41. MALE WARRIOR'S QUARTERS 


This room is different from the other bed 
rooms. Set apart from the rest of the room 
in the left comer is a low table surrounded 
by four comfortable chairs. There is a desk 
in the far left comer, and a sword and a 
shield hang on the wall beside it. A man 
dressed in leather is asleep on the bed. 


This man is a warrior (2nd level fighter). His 


superior strength gives him + 1 to damage in 
any attack. He is wearing leather armor and 
has a dagger in his belt. The short sword and 
shield are of normal make. There is plate mail 
armor in the wardrobe. A key on the bedside 
table unlocks the armory (room 13). A locked 
metal box in the bottom of the wardrobe con 
tains 19 gp and 20 sp.

wood. If the panel nearest the north wall is 
pressed just above eye level for a normal 
human, the secret door to the treasury will 
open. One of the chairs surrounding the table 
in this comer is backed up into this comer, so 
the chair must be moved in order to open the 
door. 

42. TREASURY 


This room is empty except for a number of 
sacks along the far wall. 


This room contains most of the valuables of 
the outpost. Two small sacks contain 200 pp 


each. Six large sacks contain 500 gp each. 
Three large sacks contain 500 sp each. Among 
the sacks is a medium-sized iron box that is 
securely locked. It weighs 100 cn. and cannot 
be opened by force. A thief can pick the lock, 
or a knock spell will open it. but it cannot be 
forced open. The box contains three vials, 
each containing a potion of growth, a ring of 
fire resistance, and a rod of cancellation. 



The result of the Great Escape scenario 
depends on how the characters do. if they fail 
to escape from the outpost, they will be placed 
in a wagon under heavy guard and their jour 
ney to Fort Doom begins. The first night out, 
the wagon will be ambushed by a raiding force 
from Luln and the characters will be rescued. 
The forced march back to warn Luln will fail; 
the raid will have caused heavy damage. Sascia 
will have other uses for her raen-ai-arms. but 
will outfit the player characters if they want to 
recover their equipment from the outpost. 

If the party successfully escapes from the 
outpost, they will arrive at Luln in time to 
warn the town against the attack. Sascia and 
her guards will prepare an ambush and drive 
off the goblins with heavy losses. The situa 
tion will remain tense, and Sascia will make 
out a full report on the situation. When the 
party is ready to leave Luln. she will ask them 
to deliver the report to the scribe Franz Dub- 
loi. who can be found with the military garri 
son in Spccularum. The party will receive a 
small sack of gold for traveling expenses and 
will be able to deliver the message without

The Town of Luln 

Luln is a frontier town about the size of 
Threshold, but much more crowded, and its 


living conditions are slighdy more primitive. 
The general services provided are much the 
same, but the quality is generally inferior to 
that of Threshold. Pan of this is due to the 
fact that the Black Eagle Barony is close by, 
and continual humanoid raids have prevented 
the development of the land, which is rich. 

The Baron's role in the town's troubles is 
something of an open secret, but the fact 
remains that Duke Stephan has hLs hands full 
with other matters and little shon of a blatant 
invasion by the Baron's regular forces will 
bring outside aid. The Baron's strategy is to 
keep the area worn down by continual harrass- 
ment while he builds his own forces. Then, 
when the Duke becomes involved in a major 
conflict elsewhere, the Baron can seize the 
town and hopefully conclude a separate peace 
with the Duke. 

The Duke knows this, of course, and has 
placed the ambitious lownmistrcss Sascia (a 
high level fighter) in charge of the place. Her job 
is to preserve the town and build up the local 
economy in the face of the Baron's interference. 

The nearby Radlebb Keep assists Luln when 
it can. which is not often-the area its garrison 
must patrol is large, and the haunted Korisze- 
gy Keep must be constantly watched. Also. 
Sascia has her eye on a knighthood, and is 
interested in proving her leadership without 
resorting to the Duke's soldiers.

EIWYN'S SANCTUARY 


Background 

The following legend is very well known. All 
the player characters should be quite familiar 
with it. The information in this section can be 
freely given to the players. 

The Church of Karameikos is widespread 
and popular mainly among the ruling classes 
of the Grand Duchy. However, one of its lesser 
orders most popular with the common folk is 
the Order of Chardastes. The Order grew out 
of an incident that happened more than 300 
years ago. At that time there were many places 
in Karameikos dedicated to Traladaran wor 
ship. A small sanctuary in Marilenev (later 
renamed Spccularum) was one of those sites. 

One day. a woman who was very sick went 
to the sanctuary and prayed to have her health 
returned. While she was praying alone in the 
sanctuary, a being called Chardastes appeared 
to the woman. He told her that the religion of 
her people was false, and that his way was the 
only true religion. To prove this, he laid his 
hands on the woman and cured her of here ill 
ness. He also left behind on the altar a won 
derful magical bell. 

The bell, of ordinary size and shape, had 
been made of purest platinum. What made it 
so remarkable was that it had no clapper 
Instead, it rang magically whenever it was 
picked up. When the Thyatians settled in 
Karameikos, they incorporated the sanctuary 
into the Church of Karameikos. 

The story of the bell has spread far and 
wide. Each year, on the anniversary of the mir 
acle, hundreds of people flock to its small 
building, hoping to be cured by Chardastes. 
They crowd into the sanctuary, a hundred or 
so at a time, and pray as the clergy sings the 
sacred words and lifts the magical bell. Most 
are disappointed, but so many have had their 
prayers answered that the Order has flour 
ished ever since. 

All that changed about five years ago. At 
that time, there was a cleric in the Order 
whose name was Elwyn. Elwyn was very dedi 
cated to the Church, and had been well 
rewarded by the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of 
the Church. But that, apparently, was not 
enough. There were rumors that Elwyn had 
begun practicing with edged weapons and 
researching the spells of the magic-users, try 
ing to learn the abilities of the other classes. 
This was a serious charge, indeed. But before 
anyone could prove the charges, Elwyn van 
ished without a trace. And to the horror of the 
people, the sacred bell of Chardastes that was 
kept in the sanctuary was gone, too! 

The Order has been in a state of crisis ever 
since. The faithful still come the the sanctuary 


on the holy day. but there have been no mirac 
ulous cures since the bell vanished. The num 
bers of the faithful have decreased in recent 
yean. 

Some time ago. rumors of a powerful hos 
tile force began to spring up. It was said that 
someone had built a large, monstrous fortress 
in a distant section of the county, and that 
those who attempted to investigate it had not 
returned. Recently, rumors have been circulat 
ing that Elwyn might be behind this mystery. 
The Patriarch Shcrlanc is interested in having 
the fortress investigated. He will have the par 
ty investigate the fortress, determine if Elwyn 
is involved, recover the sacred bell if it can be 
found, and bring Elwyn to justice if possible. 

The party will be promised 300 gp apiece to 
investigate the fortress, 1,000 gp apiece to 
recover the bell, and an additional 1,000 gp if 
they arc able to bring Elwyn alive to justice. If 
the party so requests, they are given an 
advance payment of 50% (250 gp each) with 
which they can buy non-magical equipment 
and supplies. 

A local guide is provided to take the party 
through the wilderness to the mysterious for 
tress. The guide will not, under any circum 
stances, accompany the party into the fortress. 

The party arrives on the anniversary of the 
miracle. 

Notes for the Dungeon Master 

Elwyn is a woman, but the information above 
has been written in such a way that the party 
will assume Elwyn is male. Allow the party to 
believe this so that they will not realize imme 
diately that the woman's voice they hear when 
exploring the fortress is actually the voice of 
Elwyn. 

Note that the fortress is built as a double 
spiral. There ts a secret corridor that runs 
alongside the rooms and corridors through 
which the party will travel. This corridor is 
used by Elwyn to observe the party along the 
way. She occasionally provides hints to the 
party when they get bogged down (always, of 
course, in a derogatory voice accompanied by 
a diabolical laugh), feeling secure in her 
power and ability to defeat the party anytime 
she chooses. 

Unless otherwise stated, the rooms are not 
lit. The only doors in the fortress (except for 
the entrance and the iron door between rooms 
1 and 2) are secret. Once detected, they open 
easily. 

The DM should copy the two treasure maps 
ahead of time and be prepared to hand them 
out to the players. The treasure maps need not 
be drawn to scale (page 158). 


There will be no wandering monsters in 
Elwyn's fortress. If desired, you can add wan 
dering monster encounters in the wilderness 
through which the party travels to reach the 
fortress, but it is important not to have the 
party seriously weakened before the adventure 
begins! Monster stats are given on page 34. 

OUTSIDE THE FORTRESS 


You have traveled far into the wilderness, 
and finally you have arrived at your 
destination-the mysterious fortress that 
you suspect may harbor Elwyn and the 
mystic bell of Chardastes. Your guide has 
turned back after pointing out the final 
direction you must travel. 

You follow a path that leads out of the 
forest and into a clearing. There, before 
you, is an enormous building. It is nearly 
black, and looks as if it might be made of 
iron. 

Suddenly, there is a horrid smell as four 
ugly humanoids emerge from the forest to 
your left! 

The humanoids are troglodytes. Because they 
have the ability to blend in with their sur 
roundings. they surprise on a 1-4 on d6. Their 
smell is nauseating, giving their opponents a 
- 2 penalty to their hit rolls unless the oppo 
nents make a saving throw vs. Poison. 

The lair of the troglodytes can be found in 
the forest a short distance from the path. It 
consists of a hollow in a small clearing with an 
opening that leads to an underground lair. 
The troglodytes' treasure consists of Gvc large 
sacks, two vials, and a piece of parchment with 
some faded writing on it. Two of the sacks con 
tain 500 sp each, two contain 500 gp each, and 
one contains 500 pp The two vials each con 
tain potions of healing. The parchment is 
Treasure Map # 1 (give a copy of the map to the 
players at this time), showing the location of 
the treasure in room 5. 

The party must defeat the troglodytes 
before they can enter the fortress. It is impor 
tant that they find the lair and locate the 
potions and the treasure map. Give the play 
ers hints, or even a little advice, to get them to 
look for the lair. 

1. ENTRANCE 


As you emerge once again from the forest, 
you finally get a good look at the fortress. 
The walls are fully 30 feet high, and the 
jagged shape of the outside looks like a 


30 







EIWYN'S SANCTUARY 


black dragon's teeth when it opens its 
mouth to breathe. The walls arc indeed 
made of iron. There is a door visible in the 
southwest comer. 


The only entrances to the building are the visi 
ble entrance and the secret door near it. (The 
secret door between rooms 2 and 3 on the map 
leads to the lower level, not to the outside.) It 
is recommended that you not allow the party 
to find the secret entrance at this time-if 
they do, they avoid all the traps, tricks, and 
encounters, and find Elwyn at room 16a. 

The visible entrance opens easily. The corri 
dor behind the door is dark. 


The corridor proceeds north from the door. 
After about ten feet, it opens up into a 
wide area to your left about 30 feet north- 
south by 20 feet east-west. The area 
appears to be empty. 


The area is empty. When the party has assem 
bled in this room, read the following: 


A musical, low-pitched female voice fills 
the air, saying, "Who dares to enter the 
Shrine of Elwyn unbidden? Turn back! 
TURN BACK NOW, for ahead lies certain 
death!" The voice then breaks into a dia 
bolical laugh. 


This is the voice of Elwyn, speaking from her 
secret observation corridor. The party is free to 
take her advice and leave-but this ends the 
adventure. If the party continues, wait until 
the entire party has crossed the area on the 
map indicated by a dotted line (between 
rooms 1 and 2), then read the following: 


Suddenly, you hear a resounding 
"BOOM!" behind you. When you turn 
around, you sec that a solid iron door has 
descended into the corridor, blocking your 
avenue of escape. You also notice that a 
small panel in the east wall has opened. 


The open panel reveals an obvious keyhole. 
When the proper key is inserted into the hole 
and turned, the door will rise. Elwyn has the 
only key. The lock and the door cannot be 
opened by a thiefs open lock skill, or with a 
knock spell. 

2. DAIS 


To your left you see an open area about 30 


feet north-south by about 20 feet cast- 
west. The area seems to be empty except 
for a raised area occupying the middle of 
the west wall. The raised area is about half 
a foot above the floor and looks like pol 
ished stone. There is a pedestal in the mid 
dle of the raised area. It is about three feet 
high and two feet square, and appears to 
be made of wood. On top of the pedestal is 
a black bell. 


The altar is made of marble, too heavy to be 
moved. The pedestal is a solid block of mahoga 
ny; it can be moved, although it is extremely 
heavy. At least four party members are needed to 
move it. It would be worth 500 gp on the open 
market. The bell is a normal bell made of 
wrought iron, and is worth about 1 gp. 

The secret door between rooms 2 and 3 
leads to a stairway that is more folly described 
under room 5. It is better if the party docs not 
discover it at this time. 

3. ALTAR 

If the party has been quiet as they proceed north 
through the corridor, read the following: 


You hear a low murmur of voices coming 
from the north. 


As the party enters the room: 


To your left you see an open area about 30 
feet east-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The entire length of the west wall is 
occupied by an altar. The room is dimly lit 
by a few candles on the altar. Kneeling at 
the altar are six human figures wearing 
plate mail armor, they arc making a low, 
chanting sound. 


These arc six acolytes (1st level clerics) armed 
with maces. They are followers of Elwyn. If 
the door trap was triggered or the party was 
noisy coming down the corridor, the acolytes 
arc aware of their coming; otherwise the party 
can surprise the acolytes. If the party tries to 
sneak past this room without alerting the aco 
lytes there is a 25% chance they can do so. If 
the acolytes notice the party, they attack. 

There is nothing of value in this room and 
the acolytes are not carrying any wealth. 

4. DAIS 


To your left you see an open area about 30 
fee east-west you about 20 feet north- 


south. The area seems to be empty except 
for an altar similar to the one your saw ear 
lier. There is a pedestal in the middle of 
the altar. On top of the pedestal is a bell 
that appears to be made of a reddish 
metal. 


The altar is made of marble, too heavy to be 
moved. The pedestal is a solid block of 
mahogany; it can be moved, although it is 
extremely heavy. At least four party members 
are needed to move it. It would be worth 500 
gp on the open market. The bell is a normal 
bell made of copper, and is worth about 5 gp. 

5. TREASURE OF THE TROGLODYTES 


To your left you sec an open area about 30 
feet cast-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The area seems to be empty. 


This is the room indicated on the treasure map 
found in the lair of the troglodytes. The room 
is empty except for the secret treasure located 
at the spot on the map marked with an "X." 
The floor in the room is hinged along the 
south wall. When the entire party has entered 
this room, Elwyn, who is observing from her 
corridor, triggers a mechanism that causes the 
floor to open up under the party . . . 


Suddenly, you feel the floor begin to move 
beneath your feet. As the floor swings 
down from a hinge near the south wall, 
you fall into the darkness, landing on the 
floor below. The floor swings back into 
position above you. creating a strong gust 
of air that extinguishes all torches and lan 
terns. 


5a. TRAP ROOM 

No one in the party takes any damage from 
the slide. Party members with infravision can 
see. When light is restored, the remaining 
party members also see the following: 


You are in a room about 30 feet square. It 
appears to be empty. A corridor leads off in 
one direction 


The room is empty. The party is now on the 
lower level of the fortress. The corridor leads 
to room 5b, and then to a scries of steps that 
will return the party to the upper level, as 
shown on the map of the lower level. 


31 












ELWYN'S SANCTUARY 


5b. ORC LAIR 


You see a large room, perhaps 50 feet long 
and 30 feet wide. There are a number of 
pallets about the room. Standing among 
the pallets are six small, ugly humanoids 
that look like a combination of animal and 
man. They are armed wtth short swords. 


These are five ores armed with short swords, 
and an ore leader armed with a short sword 
+ 1. The ores attack the party as soon as they 
spot them. 

If the party is using light, the ores cannot be 
surprised. If there is no light, the ores can be sur 
prised, but all humans without infravision 
receive a -4 penalty to hit rolls, and opponents 
who can see them receive a +4 bonus to hit rolls. 

The room contains six small sacks. One con 
tains 200 gp, the others contain 200 sp each. The 
ore leader carries a small pouch containing 7 
gems (worth 200 gp, lOOgp (x5), and 50 gp, 
respectively). The floor is Jittered with an assort 
ment of bones, mostly human and humanoid. 
These are the remains of previous adventurers 

The corridor leads to a stairway. The stair 
way ends in a door that opens easily. This is the 
secret door between rooms 2 and 3. Do not tell 
the party where they arc; let them discover it. 
As the party passes through rooms 3 and 4, 
read the descriptions of the rooms, modified 
by whatever has happened in the meantime. 
For example, if the party killed the acolytes in 
room 3, they find corpses. If they did not. the 
acolytes arc still there, praying. 

When the party returns to room 5. they find 
that there is a visible border around the collaps 
ing floor that is about three feet wide. If they 
wish, they can easily and safely move in single 
file to the spot marked with an "X" on the map. 

At the spot marked "X," there is a loose stone 
about three feet from the floor. When the stone 
is removed, a cavity behind the stone is found, 
containing the following: a clerical scroll with 
three cure light wound spells, a potion of poly 
morph self (labeled), a potion of growth (also 
labeled), a war hammer +1. and another trea 
sure map (this one leading to the treasure in 
room 9. Treasure Map HI). 

The potion of polymorph self is from the 
D&D(r) Expert Set. It allows the user to change 
shape into that of any living creature with hit 
dice or level equal to or less than his or her 
own. The transformation docs not change the 
user's ht points, hit rolls, or saving throws. 
The user gains the physical abilities of the new 
shape, but none of the special abilities (spell 
use, breath weapon, paralyzation attacks, 
etc.) The effect of the potion lasts for 7-12 


(ld6 +6) turns. If the user is a spell caster, he 
cannot use his own spells while polymorphed. 

6. EMPTY ROOM 


To your left you see an open area about 30 
feet north-south by about 20 feet east- 
west. The area seems to be empty. 


This room is empty. 

7. DAIS 


To your left you sec an open area about 30 
feet north-south by about 20 feet cast- 
west. The area seems to be empty except 
for an altar similar to the one you saw earli 
er. There is a pedestal in the middle of the 
raised area. On top of the pedestal is a bell 
that appears to be made of a shiny metal. 


The altar is made of marble, too heavy to be 
moved. The pedestal is a solid block of 
mahogany; it can be moved, although it is 
extremely heavy, At least four party members 
are needed to move it. It would be worth 500 
gp on the open market. The bell is a normal 
bell made of brass, and is worth about 10 gp. 

8. GOLEM CHAMBER 


You see an area to your left about 30 feet 
north-south by about 20 feet east-west. The 
room contains a strange humanoid creature 
about three feet tall and apparently made of 
wood. It is moving stiffly toward you. 


The creature is a wood golem. A golem is a mon 
ster created by a high-level magic-user or cleric. 
Golems can be hit only by magical weapons. 
Magical attacks will work, but the golem is 
immune to sleep, charm, and hold spells, and to 
all gasses. Because it is clumsy, it has a penalty of 
- 1 on its initiative roll, and because it is made 
of wood, it has a penalty of -2 on its saving 
throw vs. fire-based attacks. If it is hit by fire, it 
also takes an extra point of damage per die. 

The room is otherwise empty. 

9. TREASURE ROOM 


To your left you see an open area about 30 
feet cast-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The area seems to be empty. 


The room is empty, except for the secret trea 
sure marked with an "X" on the map. The 
treasure map (Treasure Map #2) found in 


room 5 will reveal its location to the party. As 
in room 5, the treasure is hidden behind a 
block of loose stone at waist height. Behind 
the stone is the following treasure: 

A smooth stick about 18 inches long. This is 
actually a wand of paralyzation (3 charges)- 
any elf or magic-user recognizes it for what it 
is, and only an elf or magic-user can wield it. 
The command word is written on the wand. 

A sword. This is actually a sword + 1. 

A piece of rolled-up parchment. This is 
actually a clerical scroll containing a cure light 
wounds spell and a silence 15' radius spell. 
The silence 15' radius spell is described in the 
D&D(r) Expert Set. It will make an area 30 feet 
in diameter totally silent for 12 turns. Conver 
sation and spell use in the area of the silence 
spell arc prevented. If cast on a person, the 
victim must make a saving throw vs. Spells, or 
the spell effect will move with the victim. If 
the saving throw is successful, the spell still 
works, but it stays in one place. The victim can 
then leave the area and speak normally. 

A ring. This is actually a ring of spell stor 
ing. Its operation is fully described in the 
D&D* Expert Set Once the ring is put on. the 
wearer knows what spells arc in the ring and 
how to cast them from it. After a spell is used, 
the ring may be recharged by a spell caster, 
who must cast the replacement spell directly 
at the ring. The ring will not absorb spells cast 
at the wearer. The spells in the ring have the 
duration, range, and effect equal to the lowest 
level of magic use needed in order to cast 
them. This ring has two magic missile spells, a 
web spell, and a lightning bolt spell. The 
lightning bolt spell creates a 5 foot wide. 60 
foot long bolt of lightning anywhere within its 
range (180 feet). Any creature in the area of 
effect takes 5d6 points of damage. If the vic 
tim makes a saving throw vs. Spells, damage is 
halved. If the lightning bolt strikes a solid sur 
face before reaching its 60 foot length, it 
rebounds back toward its caster until it reaches 
full length. If it hits its caster, the caster takes 
full damage (or half damage if the caster 
makes a saving throw vs. Spells). 

10. DAIS 


To your left you see an open area about 30 
feet east-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The area seems to be empty except 
for an altar similar to the ones you have 
seen throughout this strange sanctuary. 
There is a pedestal in the middle of the 
altar. On top of the pedestal is a bell that 
appears to be made of a silvery metal. 


32 










EEWYN'S SANCTUARY 


The altar is made of marble, too heavy to be 
moved. The pedestal is a solid block of 
mahogany; it can be moved, although it is 
extremely heavy. At least four party members 
are needed to move it. It would be worth 500 
gp on the open market. The bell is a normal 
bell made of silver, and is worth about 50 gp. 

11. STATUE 


To your right you see an open area about 10 
feet east-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The area seems to be empty except 
for a large stone statue in the northeast cor 
ner. The statue is an image of Chardastes. 


The statue is a living rock statue. It attacks by 
squirting magma from its fingertips as soon as 
any party member enters the space. A wom 
an's diabolical laughter (Elwyn, again) is 
heard as the creature attacks. There is no trea 
sure here. 

12. EMPTY ROOM 


To your right you see an open area about 10 
feet cast-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The area appears to be empty. 


When the first character enters the room, a pit 
trap covering the entire 10x20 area opens up. 
The pit is 10 feet deep, and the victim takes 
1-6 points of damage from the fall. The room 
is otherwise empty. 

13. STATUE 


The corridor widens here to form a room 
about 30 feet north-south by about 20 feet 
cast-west. The corridor continues off to the 
cast. The room appears to be empty except 
for a statue of a small horse in the southeast 
comci. The statue is made of a yellowish 
metal. 


The statue is made of solid bronze, and can 
not be moved. It is immune to any damage. If 
it is struck by a hand-held metal weapon, the 
wielder of the weapon suffers 2-5 points of 
damage from electrical shock (no saving 
throw). There is nothing else in the room. 

14. DAIS 


The corridor widens here to form a room 
about 30 feet north-south by about 20 feet 
cast-west. The corridor continues off to the 


east. This area contains an altar identical to 
the ones you have seen before. The bell on 
the altar is made of a golden metal. 


The altar is made of marble, too heavy to be 
moved. The pedestal is a solid block of 
mahogany; it can be moved, although it is 
extremely heavy. At least four party members 
are needed to move it. It would be worth 500 
gp on the open market. The bell is a normal 
bell made of gold, and is worth about 500 gp. 

15. CELL 


To your right you sec an open area about 10 
feet east-west by about 20 feet north- 
south. The area appears to be empty. 


The area is empty. If the entire party enters the 
room, an iron glare suddenly descends (trig 
gered by Elwyn, who is watching, as usual), 
trapping the party in the room. Elwyn laughs 
diabolically. A panel opens up in the east wall 
of the corridor, across from the cell. Behind 
the panel is a keyhole with a key stuck m it. 
"Just rum the key, and freedom is yours," she 
says mockingly. The key, when turned, causes 
the portcullis to raise. 

There arc several solutions available to the 
party. A knock spell cast on the keyhole causes 
the key to turn magically. If the party has the 
polymorph self potion, one member can drink 
it. change into a creature small enough to slip 
through the bars, exit the cell, wait for the 
potion to wear off (or change to to a larger or 
normal form), then mm the key. A character 
can attempt to lasso the key and turn it in the 
lock by twisting the rope. This requires a suc 
cessful hit roll with a - 3 penalty, but unlim 
ited attempts are allowed. Characters with a 
combined strength of 36 or more can bend the 
ban of the cell enough to allow passage; how 
ever, each character helping to bend the bars 
must make a saving throw vs. Paralysis or 
strain a muscle. The effect of a strained muscle 
is to give a character a - 2 penalty to hit rolls 
for the rest of the adventure. 

Creative players may come up with other 
unusual methods to escape this trap. Reward 
clever and creative thinking by allowing any 
reasonably good suggestion to succeed. Give a 
special award of 100 experience points to the 
player who comes up with a workable and cre 
ative solution to the trap. 


16. BLACK DRAGON 


The corridor widens here to form a room 
about 20 feet square. The corridor con 
tinues off to the west. A huge, black 
lizard-like creature with wings is asleep 
and snoring in the comer. It has an iron 
collar around its neck and it is chained to 
the wall. There are several large sacks in the 
northwest comet. 


The creature is a young black dragon, asleep. 
The party gets one round of free attacks, with 
a +2 bonus on all hit rolls. The chain on the 
dragon allows it to move up to 30 feet in any 
direction. If the party tries to sneak past the 
dragon, it automatically wakes up. 

The area on the map marked 16a is a secret 
door leading to the corridor from which Elwyn 
has been spying on the party. It is better if the 
party does not find the door at this time. If 
they do, proceed to the final encounter with 
Elwyn. Otherwise, the parry will meet Elwyn 
here after they have been to area 21. The final 
encounter with Elwyn takes place here when 
the party tries to leave. 

17-21. THE INNERMOST SANCTUARY 

Read the following to the players as they enter 
the corridor that leads to area 21. 


You see a large open area, about 20 feet 
wide and more than 100 feet long. It is 
dimly lit by a few candles in sconces along 
the walls. There arc four niches that extend 
out from the center aisle; two about 30 feet 
from this end of the hall and two more 
almost at the end. The far end seems to 
fade away into darkness. The walls that 
you can see are painted with abstract 
designs in soft colors. 


This is the innermost sanctuary of Elwyn s for 
tress. The party will presumably explore the 
area as they approach area 21. Note that the 
woman portrayed in the murals located 
behind the curtains is the same in each mural. 
If the party docs not realize this, tell them 
after they have seen the third mural. 

17. ALCOVE 


The west wall of this area is covered by a 
black curtain. 


If the party looks behind the curtain, they see: 


33 











EEWYN'S SANCTUARY 


You sec a mural depicting a woman in a 
bright yellow robe with a drawn swotd in 
her hand. She is surrounded by human vic 
tims. 


18. ALCOVE 


The cast wall of this area is covered by a 
black curtain. 


If the party looks behind the curtain, they see: 


\bu see a mural depicting a woman in a 
lavender robe kneeling at an altar. She is 
flanked by six men wearing black robes 
and armed with maces. They are standing 
at attention. The glint of metal armor can 
be seen under their tobes. 


19. ALCOVE 


The west wail of this area is covered by a 
black curtain. 


If the party looks behind the curtain, they see: 


You see a mural depicting a woman in a 
white robe. She is about to shoot an arrow 
from a longbow at a being who is begin 
ning to disappear into the sky. You recog 
nize the being as Chardastcs. 


20. ALCOVE 


The cast wall of this area is covered by a 
black curtain. 


If the party looks behind the curtain, they see: 


You see a mural depicting a woman in a 
black robe about to descend into a great 
chasm. Leading her into the chasm is a n 
enormous male humanoid figure covered 
with short, dark fur. Only his hands and 
feet arc uncovered. He wears no clothing. 


The party member with the highest intelli 
gence recognizes this being as Leptar, a chaotic 
Immortal who was long ago defeated by Char 
dastcs. 

21. .ALTAR 

Until the party has examined all four murals, 
this area is shrouded in darkness, caused by 
the clerical spell darkness, cast by Elwyn. 
(Darkness is the reverse of light, and creates a 
30 foot circle of darkness.) As soon as the party 
has examined the last of the four murals, the 
following occurs: 


As you turn away from the mural, the 
darkness in the area to the north dissolves, 
revealing an area about 20 feet square. The 
entire area is raised about half a foot above 
the floor and looks like polished stone. 


There is a pedestal in the middle of the 
raised area. It is about three feet high, five 
feet deep, and ten feet wide, and appears 
to be made of wood. On top of the pedes 
tal is a bell that appears to be made of a sil 
ver metal. 


The altar is made of marble, too heavy to be 
moved. The pedestal is a solid block of 
mahogany; it can be moved, although it is 
extremely heavy. At least four party members 
arc needed to move it. It would be worth 500 
gp on the open market. The bell is, of course, 
the sacred platinum bell for which the party 
has been seeking. If someone picks it up, the 
following occurs: 


As you pick up the sacred bell, it begins to 
ring. At almost the same time, four crea 
tures appear and swoop down upon you, as 
if called by the sound of the bell. Two of 
the creatures are ugly things with homs 
and long fangs. The other two are dark and 
hard to make out. Their outlines seem to 
shimmer and you can almost see through 
them. 


The homed creatures are flying gargoyles; the 
other two creatures are shadows. They have 
emerged through the one-way secret doors in 
areas 19 and 20. and immediately attack the 
party. 

Gargoyles can only be hit with magic or 
magical weapons. They arc not affected by 
sleep and charm spells. Shadows can only be

hit by magical weapons. When a shadow 
scores a hit on an opponent, it drains one 
point of Strength from its victim in addition 
to causing normal damage. The loss of 
Strength lasts for eight turns, but any creature 
whose Strength is reduced to zero becomes a 
shadow. Shadows, like gargoyles, arc unaf 
fected by sleep and charm spells. 

16a. EEWYN THE ARDANT 

If the party defeats the monsters and recovers 
the sacred bell, they can then leave the for 
tress. However, as they leave, Elwvn the 
Ardent leaves her secret corridor and is wait 
ing for the party in area 16a. 


You see a woman standing in the corridor 
to the east. She is wearing a striped robe of 
bright yellow, lavender, white, and black, 
and she carries a glowing shield. She is 
clearly the woman depicted in the murals. 
There is a glint of metal armor beneath her 
robe, and on her belt is a key ring and a 
mace. As she begins to speak, you recog 
nize the voice that has taunted you 
throughout this expedition: 

"In the name of Leptar. welcome to MY 
holy sanctuary. You have done very well; 
much better than all the other miserable 
wretches that have tried to assault my for 
tress. I presume you found their bones after 
you defeated my ores. Oh. well, ores are easy 
to find, and they like working for Elwyn the 
Ardent. The new ones will enjoy feasting on 
YOUR bones when I get through with you!" 


Elwyn is wearing plate mail armor and carries 
a shield + 1. The key ring on her belt opens 
the iron door between rooms 1 and 2. She is 
armed with a mace of draining + 1 . In addi 
tion to normal damage, this mace will, on 
command, drain one experience level from 
the character hit, as a wight. It can only absorb 
a total of three levels. After those levels arc 
used up, it becomes a normal mace + 1. 

Note that Elwyn has superior strength, 
which gives her an additional +1 to damage 
on any attack. 

Elwyn's spells are as follows: 

1st level: cause fear, darkness (used) 

2nd level: blight, hold person 

3rd level: curse 

Most of these spells arc contained in the 
D&D(r) Expen Set. 

Cause fear is the reverse of remove fear. It 
will make any one creature flee for two turns. 
This reversed spell has a range of 120 feet. 

Darkness is the reverse of light. It creates a 


circle of darkness 30 feet in diameter. Elwyn 
has already used this spell on the altar. 

Blight is the reverse of bless. It places a -1 
penalty on enemies' motaie, hit rolls, and dam 
age rolls. Each victim may make a saving throw 
vs. Spells to avoid the penalties. It affects all crea 
tures within a 20 foot square area, and lasts for 
six turns. Elwyn casts this spell on the party when 
they first leave the altar. The DM should make a 
secret saving throw for each party member 
before they reach Elwyn. 

Hold person affects human or human-like 
beings. Each victim must make a saving throw 
vs. Spells or be paralyzed for 9 turns. The spell 
may be cast at a single person or at a group. If 
cast at a single person, a - 2 penalty applies to 
the saving throw. If cast at a group, it will 
affect up to 4 persons (at the cleric's choice), 
but with no penalty to their rolls. The paraly 
sis can only be removed by its reverse or the 
dispel magic spell. 

Curse is the reverse of remove curse. It 
causes a misfortune or penalty to affect the 
victim. Curses are limited only by the caster's 
imagination, but if an attempted curse is too 
powerful, it may return to the caster! Elwyn is 
considering a curse to make one of the party's 
boots turn to glue and stick to the floor. The 
DM, of course, may think of a more ingenious 
curse. The victim is entitled to a saving throw 
vs. Spells against the curse. 

Elwyn's strategy is to cast blight before the 
party arrives. She will then cast hold person fol 
lowed by curse. Then, she will cast cause fear. 
Afterward, she will pull out her mace + 1 and 
attack the party. If the black dragon is still alive, 
she frees it from its chain and it also attacks the 
party. 

Unaware that the party has acquired a web 
spell, she is standing in the narrow corridor and 
can be quickly imprisoned if the party is clever. If 
the party uses the lightning bolt, they should be 
careful, because the rebound can cause a great 
deal of damage to their own side. 

Elwyn should be a tough opponent, but not 
impossible to defeat. She will never surrender. 
Once she is defeated, the party automatically 
sees the slightly-opcn secret door behind her. 
Just inside the secret door is Elwyn's treasure: 
a small wooden chest containing 11 gems 
(worth a total of 1,630 gp), and 2 pairs of 
matching bracelets (one worth 1.000 gp each 
and the other worth 1,100 gp each). Beside 
the chest is a staff of healing 

The party can use the key on Elwyn's belt to 
open the iron door between rooms 1 and 2, 
and exit through the front door, or they can 
follow Elwyn's secret corridor to the door that 
leads to the outside. 


Following the adventure at Elwyn's Sanctuary, 
the adventurers return to Threshold with the 
bell. Word rapidly spreads about the party's 
deeds. For the next week or so. the party will 
not be able to keep up with the invitations - 
this is a good time to have the characters drop 
a few hundred gold pieces for fancy dress, 
presents for the hosts, and similar items. This 
also a good time to introduce more NPC con 
tacts if the players are interested. 

Eventually things will quiet down The bell 
will be put away pending a decision to build a 
new shrine in Threshold or return it to Specu- 
larum (the former will call for a special tax, the 
latter could lead to a new adventure). At this 
time the players may either be called in by the 
Church or receive an unusual dream visit. The 
first leads to the Caves of Chaos, the second is 
detailed in Interlude E. 

Further investigation of Elwyn has revealed 
that Elwyn recently concluded a secret alliance 
with an evil temple hidden in some caves near 
Castellan Keep. The area is filled with human 
oids, but the temple must be found and 
destroyed. The characters must travel upriver 
past Kelvin by boat, to the military post called 
Castellan Keep. If they agree, they will receive a 
letter of introduction from Shcrlane 

The trip to the fort, though long, is unevent 
ful. The party will leave the boat in a wilderness of 
wooded hills and complete their journey on foot. 

The keep looms atop a sheer-walled mount of 
stone, teachable only by means of a narrow rocky 
track. Its gatehouse opens on an outer bailey, 
which contains stables, barracks, a tavern, a 
chapel, and similar structures. Through a second 
gatehouse is the inner bailey and main keep, for 
bidden to ail except those on official business. 

The commander will be polite, but formal. 
He is worried about giants, not evil temples. 
He has no time, men or equipment to spare 
for the concerns of a patriarch in another pan 
of the realm. Supplies can be drawn from the 
quanermaster at twice list price, subject to 
availability-and it's a shame you didn't 
bring some recruits with you. The interview 
ends as an aide interrupts with some impor 
tant papers to be signed. (If the party is rude, 
the commander will become less cooperative.) 

The tavern keeper can give the pany the 
location of the cave complex, which has been 
pretty quiet lately. Since there arc no giants 
there, patrols have been few. These rumors 
are available from soldiers in the tavern: 

1. Tribes of different creatures live in the caves. 

2. All of the cave entrances arc trapped. (False) 
3 If you get lost, beware the cater of men! 

4. "Brcc-yark" is goblin language for "we 
surrender!" (False) 

5. There is more than one tribe of ores with 
in the caves.

Genera/ Notes: This module, originally titled 
B2, The Keep on the Borderlands, has been 
the standard introductory module from the 
earliest boxed editions of the D&D(r) rules. 
The adventure consisted of a detailed Keep, 
to be used as a base, and a cave complex 
known as the Caves of Chaos. The latter has 
been included here. 

Cave Maps.138-139 


START: The forest you have been passing 
through has been gening more dense, tan 
gled. and gloomier than before. The thick, 
twisted tree trunks, unnaturally misshapen 
limbs, writhing toots, clutching and grasping 
thorns and briars all seem to wam and ward 
you off, but you have forced and hacked your 
way through regardless. Now the strange 
growth has suddenly ended - you have 
stepped out of the thicket into a ravine-like 
area. The walls rise rather steeply to either side 
to a height of about 100' or so - dark, 
streaked rock mingled with earth. Clumps of 
trees grow here and there, both on the floor of 
the ravine and up the sloping walls of the can 
yon. The opening you stand in is about 200' 
wide. The ravine runs at least 400' west (actu 
ally 440') to where the western end rises in a 
steep slope. Here and there at varying heights 
on all sides of the ravine, you can see the black 
mouths of cave-like openings in the rock 
walls. The sunlight is dim, the air is dank, 
there is an oppressive feeling here - as if 
something evil is watching and waiting to 
pounce upon you. There arc bare, dead trees 
here and there, and upon one a vulture 
perches and gazes hungrily at you. A flock of 
ravens rise croaking from the ground, the beat 
of their wings and their cries magnified by the 
terrain to sound loud and horrible. Amongst 
the litter of rubble, boulders, and dead wood 
scattered about on the ravine floor, you can 
sec bits of gleaming ivory and white - closer 
inspection reveals that these ate bones and 
skulls of men, animals and other things. . . . 

You know you have certainly discovered the 
Caves of Chaos. 

NOTES FOR THE DM 

CAVE AREA MAP: There are woods overlays 
and rough contour lines shown on the map. 
These arc only for surface movement refer 
ence, and once your players are underground 
you should ignore these markings. 

WOODS: The small groves and copses are 
thick growths, tangled and forbidding. You 
may, at your option, have characters encoun 
ter occasional monsters herein - stirges, 
humanoids (kobolds, ores, etc.) from the 
caves nearby, or the like. Movement through 
these wooded areas is slow and difficult. Char 
acters must move in single file. Even though 
not shown, there are single trees, shrubs, and 
bushes elsewhere. 

UNDERGROUND: The caves, passages, and 
rooms of the complex are on different levels. 


Passages slope upwards and downwards 
between the contours, even where stairways 
are not shown. Areas are rooted by at least 5' 
of solid rock. 

INTERIORS: Except where noted otherwise, 
all underground areas are natural or hewn 
from living rock. All surfaces are rough (and 
easy to climb for a thief) with small ledges, 
minor cracks, and s m all openings, etc. 

RANSOMING PRISONERS: Organized 
tribes can optionally be allowed to take player 
characters prisoner, freeing one to return to 
the Keep in order to bring ransom back to free 
the captives. Set the sums low - 10 to 100 gp 
(or a magic item which the ransoming mon 
ster would find useful) per prisoner. If the ran 
som is paid, allow the characters to go free. 
Then, without telling the players, assume that 
this success brought fame to the capturing 
monsters, so their numbers will be increased 
by 2-12 additional members, and the tribe 
will also be very careful to watch for a return of 
the the adventurers seeking revenge for their 
humiliating captivity. The period of extra 
alertness will last 1-4 weeks; the increase in 
numbers is permanent. 

TRIBAL ALLIANCES AND WARFARE: You 
might allow player characters to somehow 
become aware that there is a constant skir 
mishing going on between the goblins and 
the hobgoblins on one side and the ores, 
sometimes with giant allies, on the other - 
with the kobolds hoping to be forgotten by 
all, and the bugbears picking off any strag 
glers who happen by. With this knowledge, 
they might be able to set tribes to fighting one 
another, and then the adventurers can take 
advantage of the weakened state of the feud 
ing humanoids. Be careful to handle this 
whole thing properly; it is a device you may 
use to aid players who arc few in number but 
with a high level of playing skill. It will too 
easy if there are too many players, or if the 
players do not actually use wits instead of force 
when the opportunity presents itself. 

MONSTERS LEARNING FROM EXPERI 
ENCE: Allow intelligent monsters (even those 
with only low intelligence) to learn from expe 
rience. If player characters use flaming oil 
against them, allow the monsters to use oil as 
soon as they can find some. If adventurers are 
always sneaking up on them, have the mon 
sters set warning devices to alert them of 
intruders. If characters run from overwhelm 
ing numbers have the monsters set up a ruse 
by causing a few to shout and make noise as if 


36 







THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


there were many coming, thus hopefully 
frightening off the intruders. This method of 
handling monsters is basic to becoming a 
good DM. Apply the principle wherever and 
whenever you have reason. 

EMPTIED AREAS: When monsters arc 
cleared out of an area, the place will be desert 
ed for 1-4 weeks. If no further intrusion is 
made into the area, however, the surviving 
former inhabitants will return or else some 
other monster will move in. For instance, a 
troll might move into a minotaur's cave com 
plex (1.). bringing with him whatever treasure 
he has. 

Encounter Areas: 

A. KOBOLD LAIR: There is a 2 in 6 chance 
that as the group enters the cave-like tun 
nel, 8 kobolds will come out from hiding 
in the trees above and attack first. 
Kobolds: (AC 7, HD 1/2, hp 3 each, #AT 

1. D 1-4, MV 40', Save NM. ML 6). Each 
carries d8 sp. 

Note: 30' inside the entrance is a pit. 
There is a 3 in 6 chance that each person in the 
front rank will fill in unless they are probing 
ahead. There is a 1 in 6 chance that individ 
uals in the second rank will also fall in. but 
only if they are close to the first rank and the 
character ahead has already fallen in. The pit 
is 10' deep, and those falling in will take 1-6 
points damage. The pit lid will close, and 
those persons within cannot escape without 
aid from the outside. The noise will attract 
creatures from areas 1. and 2. Planks for cross 
ing the pit are stored at #1., beyond. 

1. GUARD ROOM: 6 kobold guards. (AC 
7, HD 1/2, hp 3 each, D 1-4). They will 
throw spears the first round if they have 
initiative. Each carries d6 sp. One will run 
to alert areas 4. and 6. The guards will be 
alerted by loud noises or lights. 

2. GIANT RATS (amidst garbage and 
waste): There arc 18 giant rats (AC 7, HD 
1/2, hp 2 each, #AX 1, D 1-3 plus disease, 
MV 40'. Save NM, ML 8). Each time a 
character is bitten there is a l-in-20 chance 
of getting a disease unless a save vs. Poison 
is made. If the saving throw fails, there is a 
25% chance the character will die in 1-6 
days. Otherwise the the character will be 
too sick to adventure for one game month. 
These monsters are the pets of the kobolds, 
living off the garbage and waste of their 
hosts. They will rush to the sound of the 


trap door closing or battle. They have 
nothing of value in their lair or on their 
bodies, but their leader (rat #18) who will 
be at the back of the pack, a huge fellow 
(AC 5 due to speed and cunning, HD 1-1, 
hp 4. #AT 2, D 2-4/2-4, i.e. 1-3 + 1, MV 
40', Save Fl, ML8) wean a thin silver chain 
set with 5 small gems (jewelry value 400 
gp, chain value 50 gp, each gem worth 50 
gp). The weight of a few rats will not trig 
ger the pit trap. 

3. FOOD STORAGE ROOM: The door is 
locked. This place contains various sorts of 
dried and salted meat, grain, and vegeta 
bles in sacks, boxes, barrels, and piles. 
There arc also bits and pieces of past 
human victims. There is nothing of value 
here; even the wine in a large cask is thin 
and vinegary. 

4. GUARD ROOM: Here are 3 very large 
kobold guards with chain mail and bows to 
fire down the passage at attackers (AC 5, 
HD 1 +1. hp 5 each. #AT 1, D 1-6 MV 40'. 
Save Fl, ML 6). The guards will hide 
behind the comer for cover, so all missiles 
fired at them will be at -2 "to hit". Each 
carries an axe in his belt and a purse with 
2d6 gp. 

5. KOBOLD CHIEFTAIN'S ROOM: This 
huge kobold is equal to a 2 hit dice mon 
ster, has 8 hit points, chain mail and shield 
(AC 4), with a large gem on a great golden 
chain about his neck (value 1,200 gp). He 
has the key to the storage room (#3). He 
hits for 2-8 (2d4) points of damage with a 
large battle axe. (AC 4, HD 2, hp 8, #AT 
1. D 1-8, MV 40'. Save F2. ML 8). There 
are 5 female kobolds in the room also, (AC 
7, HD 1/2, hp 2 each, #AT 1. D 1-3, MV 
40', Save NM, ML 8 due to the chief). 
There are heaps of cloth and bits of bat 
tered furniture in the place. Hidden in an 
old blanket hanging on the wall are 50 gp 
(sewn into the hem). Each female has d6 
gp. A locked chest holds 203 cp, 61 sp, and 
22 cp. 

6. COMMON CHAMBER: The bulk of the 
kobold tribe dwells here. There are 17 
males (AC 7, HD 1/2, hp 3 each, #AT 1, 
D 1-4, MV 40', Save NM, ML 6), 23 
females (AC 7, HD 1 /2, hp 2 each. #AT 1. 
D 1-3, MV 40', Save NM, ML 6), and 8 
young (which do not attack). If their caves 
are invaded, those able will help in its 
defense. Males have d6 sp each, females d4 
sp each; the young have nothing. Amidst 


the liner of doth and bits and scraps of 
odds-and-ends there is a piece of silk worth 
150 gp. (If the party docs not search, it will 
not be located.) 

DM NOTE: Kobold losses will not be 
replaced, though injured kobolds will heal. If 
the anackers hurl oil at the kobolds, they will 
retreat if possible, rather than suffer damage. 
(Should they have the opportunity to find any 
flasks of oil, the kobolds will use them against 
attacking characters!) 

B. ORC LAIR: Upon entering, the party will 
see that the wall 30' to the north is deco 
rated with heads and skulls (human, elven, 
dwarven) in various stages of decay. These 
cheerful greetings are placed in niches that 
checker about 100 square feet of the sur 
face of the wall. Close inspection will show 
that one is orcish (sec g. below). Sounds of 
activity can be heard from the west, but all 
is quiet to the cast 

Area g: This nanowing area is a guard 
post, the watcher (Ore: AC 7, HD 1, hp 5, 
#AT 1. D 1-6, MV 40', Save Fl, ML 8) having 
a small window-like opening from which he 
can observe the entrance to the lair. A piece of 
gray canvas behind gives the impression that 
the guard's head is another of the ghastly tro 
phies that decorate the wall. If adventurers 
enter, he will quickly duck down, slipping a 
goblin head into the place his own was. and 
alert the ores at 7. 

7. GUARD ROOM: 4 ores: (AC 7, HD 1, 
hp 5 each #AT 1, D 1-6, MV 40', Save Fl, 
ML 8). These guards are armed with 
spears. Each carries one for hurling and 
one to melee with. They have d8 ep each. 
When alerted they will rush to engage 
intruders, raising a hue and cry when they 
sec them. There is nothing of value in their 
chamber, only pallets and shabby clothing 
hanging on pegs. 

8. The watcher (g.) will alert the 4 guards 
here (exactly as in 7. above) who will rush 
west and then south to flank or surround 
the intruders threatening area 7. or 9. or 
approaching their own quarters 

9. BANQUET AREA: There is a great fire 
place on the south wall and many tables 
and benches in this 30' x 50' chamber - 
the table at the north end having a large 
chair at its head where the ore leader usu 
ally holds court. The place is empty of ores, 
although there is a small fire of charcoal 


37 




THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


burning in the fireplace. 

10. COMMON ROOM: Here are quartered 
12 male ores (AC 7, hp 4 each, #AT 1, Save 
Fl, ML 8) and 18 females and 9 young 
(who do not fight). The males have 2d6 sp 
each, the others have nothing of worth. 
The few furnishings in the room arc like 
wise of no value. 

11. STORAGE CHAMBER: The doot is 
locked. Amidst the stacks and heaps of 
supplies and goods here (see 3.. above), 
there are 3 shields, 17 spears, and 2 axes in 
excellent condition (by some quirk of 
fate). A small crate in the far northeast cor 
ner contains a long-forgotten light cross 
bow and 60 bolts. There is nothing else of 
value in the place. 

12. ORC LEADER'S ROOM: This large 
creature is clad in chain mail, has a magic 
shield +1. and carries a mace. He fights as 
a 4 hit dice monster, has 15 hit points, and 
adds +2 to damage he causes when suc 
cessfully striking an opponent (thus, 3-8 
points of damage) due to his strength and 
skill. He carries 31 gp, and wears a ring set 
with a gem (total value 700 gp). 

The room is carpeted, has tapestries upon 
the walls (note one of these covers the 
entrance to the small cave to the west), and 
battered but still serviceable furniture and a 
cot. His two mates sleep on cushions at the 
foot of his resting place. The two females in 
the place fight as males (HD 1. hp 3 each, #AT 
1, D 1-6, Save Fl, ML8), and each has 2d6 gp 
on her person. The chests and other furniture 
have nothing of value. 

If hard pressed, the leader will wiggle behind 
the tapestries on the south wall and attempt to 
work the catch on the secret door to the south 
and go to the rival tribe for help, but his very 
life must be in great peril before he will do so. 
(Adventurers can only spring this catch by 
rolling a I (on a d6) twice in a row. or having 
two characters do so simultaneously.) 

Area t: This alcove is used by the ore leader 
to store arms and treasure. There are two 
complete suits of chain mail here (man- 
sized and dwarf-sized), 4 swords, and a 
locked iron chest which holds 205 cp. 386 
sp, 81 gp and 13 pp. A small niche in the 
back wall, with a boulder in front covering 
it, hides a potion of healing and a scroll 
with a 6-die fire ball spell on it. 

(DM Note: Ore losses cannot be replaced, but 


after an initial attack by adventurers, four of 
the males at location 10. will move to area 9., 
arm themselves with light crossbows, and lay 
an ambush for intruders. If the leader is slain, 
all surviving ores from this locale will seek ref 
uge with the tribe at C. (see below), taking 
everything of value with them, and B. will 
thereafter be deserted). 

C. ORC LAIR: Similar to the ores at area B., 
these monsters inhabit cave areas 14-16. 
These ores, however, do not rely upon a 
continual watch being kept; instead, they 
have a series of nearly invisible strings run 
ning across the entry passage, about 11' 
from the entrance. When any of these 
strings is tripped, a heavy, weighted net 
suspended from the ceiling will drop upon 
the intruders, and metal pieces tied to it 
will create an alarm sound. (The trip 
strings will be spotted only if careful obser 
vation is asked for, each observer having a 1 
in 6 chance of seeing the devices. The cam 
ouflaged net is 10' wide and 18' long, 
made of thick tarred ropes, and will entrap 
the victim for 1-4 rounds. Meanwhile, ores 
from area 14. will be there in 1 round....) 

13. FORGOTTEN ROOM: Only the two 
ore leaders (from this area and from B.) 
know of this place. They secretly meet here 
on occasion to plan cooperative ventures or 
discuss tribal problems, for although the 
separate tribes are not exactly friendly, 
both leaders are aware of the fact that there 
is strength in numbers. A small table and 
two chairs are in the middle of the room. A 
wooden chest to one side holds a bow, a 
quiver of 20 arrows, 2 swords, and 2 dag 
gers. Two shields arc hung on the south 
wall. There are only odds and ends other 
wise, except that in the southeast comer, 
hidden beneath an old bucket (which is 
filled with black, stagnant water) are two 
small pouches, each holding one gem of 50 
gp value, 10 gp. and 20 sp. Nesting under 
these small pouches, arc 2 giant 
cendpeder. (AC 9. HD 1/4, hp 2 each, 
#AT 1. D illness. MV 20' Save NM. ML 7). 

14. COMMON CHAMBER: Here arc quar 
tered 9 male ores with shields and swords 
(AC 6, HD l, hp 3 each. #AT 1. D 1-6. 
Save Fl, ML 8) and 8 females and 3 young 
who do not fight. The males have d20 sp 
each, the females d4 cp, the young have 
nothing. The place is a mess, and there is 
nothing of value in it. The males will go to 
the entrance if they hear the net falling, 
arriving in 1 round. 


15. COMMON HALL: General meetings 
are held here, and food is likewise cooked 
and eaten here. There are 6 males here, 2 
with light crossbows (AC 6, HD l, hp 3 
each, #AT 1. D 1-6, Save Fl, ML8) and 4 
females (non-combatant), dwelling in the 
western forepan. Each has treasure on their 
person equal to 14. above. The males here 
will also go to the entrance if they here the 
noise of the net falling, arriving in 3 
rounds. 

16. LEADER'S ROOM: A guard (g.) is 
always posted just inside the door, and he 
cannot be surprised. (Ore: AC 5, HD 
1 + 1. hp 6. #AT 1, D 1-6. Save Fl, ML 8, 
carries 2d6 sp and d4 gp.) He immediately 
shouts an alarm if any intruders attempt to 
enter. Behind him are stacks of barrels and 
boxes and sacks - extra supplies for the 
tribe. (One small wine barrel, 400 coins in 
weight, contains a good quality wine worth 
55 gp.) None of the other items here have 
value, and the foodstuffs ate not up to 
human standards. 

The area to the east houses the leader (AC 
2, HD 3, hp 16, #AT 1. D 1-6, Save F3, ML 
10). He is a very large ore who wears plate 
and carries a shield, uses a sword, and 
attacks as a 3 hit dice monster. At his belt is 
a magic axe +1 which he can hurl at an 
opponent, and he can do so and still attack 
normally in the same round of combat. His 
belt is of silver, with a gold buckle (total 
value 160 gp). and his sword has a 100 gp 
gem set in its pommel. In his purse are 8 
gp. 17 ep. and 5 sp. His mate is equal to a 
male ore in combat (AC 7, HD 1. hp 5 #AT 
1, Save Fl, ML 10). and she has a bracelet 
of ivory which is worth 100 gp. The area is 
well furnished, and a small chest of 
drawers contains a sack with 50 pp tied 
shut with a rope of climbing. There is also 
a copper bowl, finely wrought and chased 
with silver, on a small table near the bed. It 
is filled with garbage and very tarnished, 
so it looks only as if it were worth 10 sp, 
rather than the actual 50 gp, unless it is 
closely inspected. 

(DM Note: Ore losses cannot be replaced. If 
this tribe is attacked, they will have the males 
at area 15. watching the entrance, ready for a 
second try by the adventurers. If the leader is 
slain, the survivors will seek safety in area B.. 
if possible; otherwise, they will flee the place 
entirely, carrying their goods away.) 

D. GOBLIN LAIR: The natural cave quickly 


38 



THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


turns into the worked stone tunnels typical 
of this whole complex. The passageways 
here arc very busy, and for every 10' dis 
tance covered by the party there is a 1 in 6 
chance that they will encounter a group of 
goblins (see below). Check each time the 
party travcb 30' (a 3 in 6 chance) until 
wandering goblins are encountered, then 
check no further. When an encounter 
occurs, the entire bunch of goblins will 
attack and cry out an alarm (Brec-Yark!) at 
the same time. Wandering goblins are in 
addition to those found in numbered 
areas. 

Wandering Goblins: 6 males, (AC 6, HD 1- 
1. hp 3 each. #AT 1. D 1-6. MV 20'. Save NM. 
ML 7). Each will have d6 sp. (They are patrol 
ling and carrying messages back and forth 
The group will also be carrying several bags 
(d6) of fairly good foodstuffs - not worth 
much, but quite suitable for human fare.) 

17. GUARD CHAMBER: 6 goblin guards 
with several spears each (AC 6. HD 1-1. hp 
3 each. #AT 1. D 1-6, Save NM, ML 7) arc 
alertly watching both passages here for 
intruders of any sort, including hobgoblins 
from the south. They each have d4 x 10 cp 
and d4 sp. The chamber has a band with 
60 small spears, a small table, 2 benches 
and a keg water. 

18. GUARD CHAMBER: This is the same 
as 17., above, except the goblins watch 
mainly to the east. If there is a cry of 
"BREE-YARK" ("Hey, Rube!"), two of 
these guards will rush to the secret door, 
toss a sack with 250 gp in it to the ogre 
(E.,22., below) and ask him to help them. 
The ogre will accept payment and will 
enter the goblin's lair and move to attack 
intruders immediately, if possible. The 
sack of gold coins is hidden in a water bar 
rel in the corner by the secret door. 

19. COMMON ROOM: There are 10 males 
(AC 6. HD 1-1. hp 3 each. FAT 1. D 1-6, 
Save NM. ML 7) and 12 females and 6 
young (who do not fight) dwelling here. 
Food is prepared and eaten here, and gen 
eral meetings arc likewise held here. There 
are heaps of bedding, tables, stools, 
benches, etc. all around the whole place, 
making it very cluttered. Each male has d6 
sp, each female has 2d6 cp. If the wander 
ing group of goblins has not been encoun 
tered when the adventurers enter this area, 
be certain to have those 6 additional males 
in this chamber. 


20. CHIEFTAIN'S ROOM: The goblin 
leader (AC 4 due to chain mail and shield, 
HD 3. hp 11, #AT 1, D 2-7 due to strength 
and skill, Save F3. ML 9). 3 guards (AC 5, 
HD l + i, hp 7 each, #AT 1, D 1-6, Save 
Fl, ML 9 due to presence of chief), and sev 
eral females are quartered here. The chief 
and the guards have bows hung on the 
wall, and if there is time, they will take 
them down and use them. If hard pressed. 
2 of the female goblins can fight as well as 
males, and will do so (AC 7, HD 1-1, hp 2 
each, #AT 1, D 1-6, Save NM, ML 9 due to 
the presence of the chief); the other 
females do not fight. The chief has a purse 
with 18 gp and 2 pp in it; each of his 
guards has 8 ep and d6 sp. There is a silver 
cup (value 90 gp) under his bed. 

This place has quite a bit of furniture in it 
- all scaled goblin-size, of course. A low 
bench near the bed has a secret drawer 
door under the scat, and inside is stored 
the treasure of the goblins: a tapestry with 
silver and gold threads which is worth 900 
gp. Nearby is a stand with a pewter bowl 
which holds 273 sp and 321 cp. 

21. STORAGE CHAMBER: Note that at 
position g there are 4 goblin guards on 
duty (AC 6. HD 1-1, hp 4 each, #AT 1, 
D 1-6, Save NM. ML7) armed with ready 
crossbows and swords. Many bales, boxes, 
crates, barrels, and sacks are stacked and 
heaped in the large chamber. They contain 
cloth, food, beer, and wine - all of no 
special worth. The hard-working but not- 
too-bright goblins continually bring sup 
plies of stolen and looted goods to this 
place. They do not realize that their large 
cousins, the hobgoblins at area F.. below, 
use a secret door known only to them to 
steal the best foodstuffs and drink. If the 
adventurers stay in this chamber for more 
than 1 turn, a party of 4 hobgoblins will 
come through the secret door: 

4 Hobgoblins: AC 6, HD 1 + 1. hp 6 each, 
#AT 1. D 1-8. MV 30'. Save Fl. ML 9). Each 
carries d4 gold pieces. 

(DM Note: Goblin losses cannot be replaced 
If they are being soundly defeated by 
intruders, the goblins will attempt to hide or 
flee east. Those who do so will go from area 
17. to area 23.. inform the hobgoblins, and 
join forces with them, so adjust encounters 
appropriately.) 

E. OGRE CAVE: Persons entering this place 


will notice a strong, sour odor and then 
notice what appears to be a huge bear 
sprawled asleep in the southwest part of 
the cave. This is nothing more than the 
skin of a huge bear which the ogre killed 
and uses as a bed. making it comfortable 
by heaping leaves underneath. The ogre 
sits in the eastern portion of his lair, and 
noises will certainly bring him ready to do 
battle. This huge ogre has AC 4, due to 
another thick bearskin he wears for protec 
tion. He strikes opponents for 3-12 (ldlO 
+ 2) points of damage (AC 4. HD 4 + 1, 
hp 25. D 3-12, MV 30', Save F4, ML 10). 
The ogre has grown wealthy by serving as a 
mercenary - generally on the side of the 
goblins (and their occasional allies, the 
hobgoblins), although he has been bought 
off by the ores and gnolls from time to 
time. He will rush to aid the goblins when 
they toss him a sack of coins (see 18., 
above). If anyone offers him a greater fee 

- one which he can actually see and feel 

- it is 90% likely that he will simply take 
it (and the goblin's money too!), and 
return to his lair. 

22. The ogre sits here on top of a great leath 
er bag. In this bag arc seven large sacks 
which contain: 

#1: 287 sp: #2 a hard cheese; #3: 182 cp and 
91 ep; #4: 289 gp; #5 a keg of brandy (value 
80 gp); #6: 303 cp; #7: 241 gp (actually lead 
coins with a wash of gold, so value of each is 
only 1 copper!). 

If intruders offer him a bribe of 20 or more 
gold piece value, the ogre will be 90% likely 
to allow them to leave unmolested, but if he 
catches them again, he will attempt to kill 
them, whatever the offers. Hidden under a 
heap of old bones in the southern portion of 
his cave arc 6 magic arrows +/, a potion of 
invisibility, and a magic scroll with 2 clerical 
spells - cure light wounds, find traps. 

F. HOBGOBLIN LAIR: Seldom are these 
fierce creatures troubled by marauders, for 
the entrance to their lair is guarded by a 
stout, barred door at the back of the entry 
cave. Skulls are lined along the walls, and 
several are affixed to the oaken door to 
highlight a warning written in common 
runes: "Come in - we'd like to have you 
for dinner!" (Which could be misinter 
preted as a cordial invitation to dine. . . .) 
Careful inspection of the barred door has a 
1 in 6 chance per person examining it of 
detecting a secret mechanism which allows 


39 




THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


a person outside to slide the bar back so 
the portal can be entered. If it is forced 
open, it will require three Is (on a d6) to 
break the bar, and the noise will alert the 
six hobgoblins in area 26. If a knock spell is 
used to open the door, the noise of the fall 
ing bar will be heard, but the guards will 
not have time to react - the intruders will 
have two rounds before the guards come. 

23. COMMON ROOM: This place quarters 
5 males (AC 6, HD 1 +1, hp 5 each. #AT 
1, D 1-8, MV 30'. Save Fl. ML 8) with d4 x 
10 sp each: 8 females (AC 7, HD l, hp 4 
each, #AT 1. D 1-6. MV 30', Save Fl. ML 
7) with 2d6 sp each, and 3 young which do 
not fight and have no treasure. There arc 
heaps of cloth and skins for beds, some 
odds and ends of furniture, a small band 
of beer, buckets, etc. in the place, all 
worthless. The males are watching the cast 
door which communicates with the goblin 
lair (D., above) and arc battle-ready. 

24. TORTURE CHAMBER/ PLAYROOM / 
FOOD STORAGE: There are 2 very large, 
ugly hobgoblins here. Each is equal to a 
2 + 1 hit dice monster, one having 10 hit 
points, the other 8 hit points, and both 
wear chain mail (AC 5). One also has a 
whip, as well as a swotd, so that he can 
strike at opponents up to 13' distant, and 
if a hit is scored, the whip will jerk the vic 
tim off his or her feet for and stun (para 
lyze) him or her for 1-2 melee rounds. 
However, once closely engaged the hob 
goblin cannot make use of his whip, so he 
will cast it aside. Each of these monsters 
has a purse with d6 cp, sp, and ep. The 
larger also has a silver armlet worth 135 gp. 
They guard 6 prisoners who arc chained to 
the walls. There are two chains, a small 
table, a central fire pit. and various imple 
ments of torture in the chamber. The keys 
to the prisoners' chains are hanging on the 
wall in the southwest comer. The prisoners 
are: 

#1: A plump, half-dead merchant, sched 
uled to be eaten tonight in a special 
banquet. If he is rescued and returned 
to the Keep, the Guild will pay a 100 gp 
reward, grant the rescuers honorary 
Guild status, and exempt them for one 
year from any fees, dues, taxes, and the 
like which the Guild would normally 
collect. 

#2: An ore (AC 7. HD 1. hp 4, ML 8) who 
will fight goblins and hobgoblins glad 
ly, if handed a weapon (of course, he 


will seek to escape from the adventurers 
at first chance, taking whatever he can 
with h i m , and informing his fellows at 
B. (above) of what happened). 

#3: A man-at-arms (AC 9. Fl. hp 5. ML 7) 
who formerly served as a guard for the 
merchant. He will take service with res 
cuers for 1 year if an offer is made, for 
room and board only, if given armor and 
weapons. 

#4: A normal female, the merchant's wife, 
in fact, who is also slated for the big 
feast. She will personally reward her res 
cuers by giving them a magical dagger 
+ 1 she has in her room back at the 
Keep. 

#5: A crazy gnoll (AC 9 due to no armor, 
HD 2, hp 9, #AT 1. D 1-6, Save F2, ML 
8) who will snatch up a weapon and 
attack his rescuers if he is freed. (He will 
cause only 1 -6 points of damage due to 
his weakened condition.) 

#6: Another man-at-arms as #3 above who 
will behave the same way his companion 
will. 

25. COMMON CHAMBER: This large 
place is used for meals, meetings and gen 
eral revels of the hobgoblin tribe. There 
are many tables and benches set out now, 
as the place is being readied for the coming 
feast. 4 males (AC 6, HD 1 + 1. hp 5 each, 
0 AT 1. D 1-8. MV 30', Save Fl. ML 8), 5 
females (AC 7, HD 1, hp 4 each. #AT 1. 
D 1-6, Save Fl. ML 7), and 9 young (who 
will not fight) arc working here. Males 
have d4 gp each, females have 2d6 sp. The 
head table has a set of pewter dishes on it, 
and their value is 25 gp for the set. 

26. GUARD ROOM: 6 hobgoblins (AC 6. 
HD 1+1, hp 6 each, #AT 1, D 1-6, Save 
Fl. ML 8), 3 with crossbows which they'll 
fire once before dropping and taking their 
maces for close combat. Each carries d4 
each gp. sp, c p. If they heat the door 
being battered, or the bar falling, all but 
one will immediately rush to the entry, 
while the other will alert area 27.. and then 
join his fellows. It takes two rounds for 
them to reach the entry, and the sixth will 
join the other guards on round four. 

27. ARMORY: 3 hobgoblin guards (AC 5 
due to chain mail, HD 1+1, hp 6 each, 
#AT 1, D 1-8, Save Fl. ML 8) are on duty 
here at all times. If warning comes, two 
will move to the door to wail in ambush. 


and the others will pass through the secret 
entrance (to area 31.) to alert the chief. 
Each guard has 2d4 each of sp and ep. In 
the chamber are the following: 

1 suit man-sized plate mail 

1 suit of dwarf-sized plate mail 

3 suits man-sized chain mail 

2 suits elf-sized chain mail 

7 suits man-sized leather armor 
11 shields 
6 daggers 

1 axe 

4 maces 

3 swords 

2 bows (short) 

1 longbow 

13 crossbows 

11 score arrows (14 arrows have 
silver heads) 

9 score bolts 
51 spears 
19 pole arms 
42 helmets of various sizes 

Armor-type items are standing or hung from 
racks. Weapons are in chests or on pegs or 
racks. 

28. STOREROOM: Goods stolen from the 
stupid goblins ate kept here until needed 
above. There will be a single guard (AC 6, 
HD 1 + 1, bp 5. #AT 1, D 1-8, SaveFl. ML 
8) on duty here at all times. He has 2d8 cp. 
(If the hobgoblin looting party does not 
encounter adventurers in area 21., they 
will also be here: 4 hobgoblins (AC 6, HD 
1 + 1, hp 6 each, #AT 1, D 1-8, Save Fl, 
ML 8). Each of the four carries d4 gp. 

29. GUARD ROOM: 2 hobgoblin guards 
with crossbows and swords stand here (AC 
6. HD 1 + 1, #AT 1, D 1-8, SaveFl. ML 8.) 
With them arc 2 females who will fight 
(AC 7, HD 1. hp 4 each, #AT 1, D 1-6, 
Save Fl, ML 7). Males have 2d6 each sp 
and cp, females have no treasure. There 
arc two cots, a bench, a stool, and a large 
box (filled with soiled clothing) in the 
room. If attackers are seen, one female will 
alert area 30., the other area 31.1; then 
both will fight. 

30. HOBGOBLIN CHIEF'S QUARTERS: 
This great ugly creature is particularly 
tough (AC 2 due to plate and shield. HD 
5, hp 22, #AT 1, D 3-10 due to strength 
and skill, MV 30', Save F5. ML 10). He has 

5 pp and 31 gp in his purse. He wears a sil 
ver and gem studded belt (value 600 gp).

THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


With him arc 4 large female hobgoblins, 
each equal to a male (AC 6, HD I + 1, hp 6 
each, FAT 1, D 1-8, Save Fl, ML 10 due to 
the chief), and each has 2d6 gp. The room 
is crowded with furniture and junk - all 
of no real worth, except that there is a false 
bottom in a huge iron box filled with man 
gy animal skins. The secret portion of the 
iron box holds 25 pp, 200 gp, 115 ep, and 
400 sp plus a 100 gp gem and a potion of 
poison. Amidst a heap of kindling wood 
near the fireplace (southeast comer) there 
is concealed a wand of paralyzation, with 
only 17 charges left. 

31. GUARD ROOM: 4 hobgoblins (AC 5 
due to chain mail, HD 1 + 1, hp 5 each, 
FAT 1, D 1-8, Save Fl, ML 8), each with 
2d6 cp. sp, and cp. They are aicn for dan 
ger, and when notified, they will pass the 
word to areas 29., 30., and/or 27., as 
required. The room is rather bare, having 
only two pallets, a stool, and a large water 
barrel. 

DM NOTE: As usual, hobgoblin losses can 
not be replaced during the course of normal 
play, which is a period of only several days or 
weeks of action. The hobgoblins arc fairly 
sman, well-organized, and alert. If their chief 
is killed, they will typically seek to escape 
alive, unless their opponents are obviously 
weak and inferior. Survivors will reinforce the 
goblins at D., above, unless their attackers are 
very dangerous and the hobgoblins can sec 
that the whole Caves' area is in trouble. 

G. SHUNNED CAVERN: Even the normal 
inhabitants of this area, including the 
ogre, stay away from here, for the creatures 
that dwell herein arc exceptionally danger 
ous. Any creature foolish enough to ven 
ture out at night becomes fair game. A 
horrible stench is noticed as soon as crea 
tures enter the cavern area. 

32. EMPTY GALLERY: The odor of these 
places is awful. Bones and rotting corpses 
arc spread here and there amidst a Utter of 
dead leaves and old branches. If a careful 
search is made, adventurers will find a coin 
every round: 1-2 = 1 cp. 3 "4 1 sp, 5-6 1 
ep. The sound of such searching might 
bring visitors! Roll on the table below for 
an encounter: 

1 Owl bear from 34., below 

2 2-12 giant rats (AC 7, HD 1/2. hp 2 
each, FAT 1, D 1-3 plus disease. MV 
40'. SaveNM. ML 8) 


3 Gray ooze from 33., below 
4-6 Nothing is attracted to the noise 

33. SHALLOW POOL: This portion of the 
cavern is very wet, and all the walls and 
floor have a sheen from the dampness. 
There is a large pool of shallow water (as 
shown), and a few white, blind fish are 
swimming therein. There is a jewel 
encrusted goblet worth 1.300 gp in the 
water. There are 3 gray ooze monsters in 
this place (only 2 if 1 has already been 
encountered in a 32., area). Each causes 1- 
8 hit points damage on the first round, 
unless attacking from above, because half 
of their damage will be taken up in 
destroying the foot and leg protection of 
the victim. Thereafter, attacks cause 2-16 
points damage, as do any attacks from 
above (AC 8, HD 3*. hp 15 each, FAT 1, 
D 1-8 first round and destroys armor, then 
2-16, MV 3', Save F2, ML 12). The pair 
always in the place are located at the south 
edge of the pool and the on the ceding in 
the southwestern portion of the area. 
There is only a 1 in 20 chance of noticing 
cither unless a pole or other device is used 
to prod the area before the pool, or unless 
two or more torches are held aloft so as to 
fully light the ceiling area. The third gray 
ooze will be on the ceiling to the left of the 
entrance, if present. 

34. OWL BEAR'S DEN: Owl Bear: AC 5, 
HD 5. hp 30, FAT 3, D 1-8/1-8/1-8, MV 
40', Save F3. ML 9). It sleeps in the most 
southern part of its den, digesting a meal 
of gnoll it just caught at dawn. If aroused, 
the beast will roar and rush out, striking 
with its two great paws, and toothy beak 
for 1-8 points of damage per hit, with 
three such attacks per round, i.e. a claw, 
another clawing attack, and then a snap of 
its beak. It has no treasure, but amidst the 
many sticks and bones it sleeps on is a bone 
tube (1 in 6 chance of noticing it for each 
person searching the heap, with a check for 
each once per round) with a protection 
from undead scroll within it. 

H. BUGBEAR LAIR: The group of bug 
bears is not numerous, but what it lacks in 
numbers, it makes up for in strength and 
cunning. There are signs beside the 
entrance cave in kobold, orcish. goblin, 
etc. Each says: "Safety, security and repose 
for all humanoids who enter - WEL 
COME! (Come in and report to the first 
guard on the left for a hot meal and bed 
assignment.)" 


35. GUARD ROOM: 3 bugbears (AC 5. 
HD 3 + 1. hp 11 each. FAT 1, D 2-8, Save 
F3, ML 9) with 2dl0 gp each. These crea 
tures lounge on stools near a smoking bra 
zier that has skewers of meat roasting over 
the coals. Each will ignore his great flail 
when intruders enter, reaching instead for 
the food. Though they do not speak com 
mon, they will grab and eat a chunk, then 
offer the skewers to the adventurers - and 
suddenly use them as swords to strike first 
blow (at +2 bonus to hit due to surprise!) 
unless the victims are very alert. There are 
two cots in the place and a large gong. If 
the battle goes badly, one will smite the 
gong to warn the others in the complex. 

36. CHIEFTAIN'S ROOM: This tough old 
bugbear is equal to an ogre (AC 5, HD 
4 + 1. hp 18. FAT 1. D 3-12 (dl0+2). Save 
F4, ML 9). He has a pouch holding a key, 
29 pp. and three 50 gp gems. With him is 
a female bugbear equal to a male (AC 5. 
HD 3+1. hp 12, #AT 1. D 2-8, Save Fl. 
ML 8, Save F3, ML 9). She has gold ear 
rings worth 100 gp. The furnishings of the 
room are battered and crude, but several 
pieces of silk arc mixed up with the bed 
ding, in all 6 may be found; the party will 
be able to sell them for 20 gp each. There is 
a gray chest stuck up on a ledge near the 
ceiling which will only be spotted if the 
room is carefully searched. It contains 
1,462 sp. a 30 pound statue of alabaster 
and ivory (worth 200 gp) and 2 potions of 
healing (which will break if the chest is 
roughly handled). It will take three or four 
strong characters to bring this down safely. 
There is a hand axe +1 on the wall, and if 
the chieftain has the chance, he will take it 
down and hurl it first, then close for full 
melee. He knows of the secret door - it is 
his escape route in desperate situations. 

37. SPOILS ROOM: The heavy door is locked 
and the key is in the pouch of the chieftain 
(36.. above). Inside are a magical shield +1 
being used as a tray to hold a heap of dried 
herbs (catnip, something these particular 
bugbears relish), various boxes and crates of 
high quality dried or salted foodstuffs, leath 
er hides m a stack, 3 barrels of ale, a tun of 
wine, and a small keg of oil (20 flask capaci 
ty). (If all but the shield and oil are sold at 
the Keep, the value will be 400 gp.) Breaking 
the lock or smashing the door will bring 
guards from 35. and the chieftain and his 
mate from 36. 

38. COMMON ROOM: 3 males (AC 5, HD 


41 


THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


3+ 1, hp 12 each. #AT 1. D 2-8. MV 30'. 
Save F3, ML 9) with 2d8 each of gp and sp. 
7 females (AC 6. HD 2. hp 8 each. #AT 1. 
D 1-8, Save F2, ML 8). and 3 young bug 
bears (AC 7, HD 1. hp 3 each, #AX 1, D 1- 
4, Save Fl, ML 7) dwell here. There arc 
piles of bedding and old garments here 
and there. Blackened by soot, there is a sil 
ver urn worth 173 gp near the fireplace, 
but only close examination will reveal its 
true value. 

39. GUARD ROOM: Watching here arc 2 
males (AC 5, HD 3 + 1, hp 10 each, #AT 1, 
D 2-8, Save F3, ML 9) with 2d8 gp each 
and 3 females (AC 6, HD 2, hp 7 each. 
#AT 1, D 1-8. Save F2, ML 8) each with 
d 10 gp. Each has a spear in addition to nor 
mal weapons, so they can hurl this missile 
and then close to fight hand-to-hand. The 
se bugbears tend to the slaves as well as 
help to guard the entrance to their lair. 
There are bedrolls, a bench, a long table, a 
water pail, and sacks of meat scattered here 
and there in the chamber. Keys to the 
doors to 40. and 41. arc on the wall oppo 
site the stairs. Both corridors to the slave 
pens have meal sacks and small boxes and 
barrels of provisions and watered wine 
along their length. 

40. SLAVE PEN: The iron door is secured by 
a bar, a chain, and a heavy padlock. Inside 
is a litter of straw, a bucket, and the follow 
ing slaves: 3 kobolds (AC 9, HD 1 12. hp 2 
each, MV 40', Save NM. ML 6). 1 goblin 
(AC 9, HD 1-1, hp 3. MV 20'. Save NM, 
ML 7), 4 ores (AC 9. HD l. hp 5 each. MV 
40', SaveFl, ML 7), and 2 human fighters 
(AC 9. Fl. hp 4 each. MV 40. ML 7) - 
optionally add 1 dwarf (AC 9, D2, hp 12, 
MV 40'. ML 8) and 2 elves (AC 9. HD 

1 +1, hp 7 each. MV 40', ML 8) in place of 

2 of the kobolds and 1 of the ores. They are 
chained to the wall with a common chain 
and a heavy padlock. All will fight against 
the bugbears if given weapons. (Treat as 
AC 9 unless protection is provided.) The 
humans will serve as those noted in F.,24.. 
above. The dwarf and elves, if used by the 
DM, may agree to help the adventurers as 
long as they stay in the Caves' area contin 
uously and fight. The other creatures will 
desert at the fust opportunity. 

41. SLAVE FEN: Another batted, chained, and 
padlocked iron door keeps safe the following 
slaves: 3 hobgoblins (AC 8, HD 1 + 1, hp 6 
each, MV 30', Save Fl, ML8). 2 gnolls (AC8. 
HD 2. + 1. hp 9 each, MV 30'. Save F2. ML 


8), 1 (rebel) bugbear (AC 7, HD 3 + 1. hp 14. 
MV 30', Save F3. ML 9) and a huge human - 
a seeming wildman, with mighty muscles, 
shaggy hair and beard, and soring eyes. He is a 
Hero (a 4th level fighter). His 18 Strength and 
+1 for his level give him a tool of +4 "to hit" 
bonus and + 3 damage (AC 9 due to no armor, 
F4, hp 24, #ATlat +4, D 4-9. ML 10). He is 
prone to fits of betsetk fury due to his enslave 
ment. and if armed and in combat it is 50% 
likely per round that he will strike a friend 
instead of a foe in his lust to shy! If freed, these 
slaves will attempt to flee, although they will 
attack bugbears who are in the way of (heir 
escape. There are two exceptions: the big bug 
bear hates hrs fellows, and will take arms and 
fight against them or any other inhabitants of 
the whole area; he will continue to do so for as 
long as the patty stays there. The hero is chaotic 
and evil; once he is armed, and after the battle 
madness leaves him, he will either kill the 
adventurers who freed him to have all their 
treasure for himself, or else he will steal what 
ever is most valuable and then sneak off - but 
only if he knows the party is too strong for him. 

(DM Note: There are 2 bugbears out hunting, 
and they will return with a human corpse and 
83 gp the day after adventurers first enter the 
bugbear lair. They will be placed on guard 
duty at 35., if appropriate, and their statistics 
are the same as the guards there. Bugbears will 
stay in place until all arc dead, save the chief 
tain. who will seek help help from the mino- 
taur I.,45.) 

I. CAVES OF THE MINOTAUR: This laby 
rinth houses a number of nasty things, but 
the worst is a fiendishly clever minotaur 
who abides herein. Immediately upon 
entering the place, adventurers will feel 
slightly dizzy - the effects of a powerful 
spell which will cause them to lose all sense 
of direction. 

The minotaur will agree to help the 
bugbears against invaders at the cost of one 
human slave every three days of service - 
of course, the slave is eaten in that period. 
The minotaur keeps only the choicest of 
treasures, tossing unwanted loot to whom 
ever happens to find it at the mouth of the 
labyrinth. 

(DM Notes: You may allow playets to find a few 
low-value coins, normal equipment, weapons, 
or armor at the entrance. After 30' past the cave 
mouth, the spell of direction confusion will 
begin to function, so stan to misdirect them by 
naming incorrect directions, i.e. southeast 
instead of northeast, east instead of west, etc. 


Don't worry about calling the same passage as a 
different direction should they travel over the 
same route twice - that's the effect of the magic 
on them. You may wish to allow the mapping 
character a secret saving throw every couple of 
turns, a 19 or 20 indicating that effect has been 
thrown off.) 

42. STIRGE CAVE: There are 13 of these 
flying monsters here: (AC 7. HD 1, hp 3 
each, #AT 1 at +2, D 1-3 the first round 
plus 1-4 per additional round, MV 60', 
Save Fl, ML 9). After an opponent is hit, 
the stirge will automatically suck blood 
each round thereafter, doing 1-4 hit points 
of damage until the victim is dead or the 
stirge is killed. The minotaur loves to catch 
and cat these creatures, so they avoid him, 
and they arc quite hungry. In fan, this 
hunger makes it 90% likely that they will 
be squeaking and hooting to one another, 
so the parry won't be surprised. They have 
no treasure. 

43. FIRE BEETLES: Three dwell in this area: 
(AC4. HD 1 +2. hp 7 each. #AT 1, D 2-8 
(2d4), MV 40', Save Fl, ML 7). They, too. 
are hungry and will hasten to attack any 
persons entering this area. They have no 
treasure, but two glands above their eyes 
and one in their abdomen will glow with a 
red light, 10' radius, for 1-6 days after the 
beetle is killed. 

44. FIRE BEETLES: There arc 2 of these 
creatures here, in all respects like those in 
43., above. 

45. THE MINOTAUR: This huge monster 
has AC 4 due to a great chain mail coat he 
wears. and carries a magic spear + I (AC 4, 
HD6. hp 35. #AT 1 or 2. D 4-9or 1-6/1-6, 
MV 40'. Save F6. ML 12). When he 
attacks, the minotaur fust tushes and stabs 
with the spear for 4-9 points damage 
(d6 + 3 due to his strength). The next 
round he will gote and bite for 1-6 points 
of damage for each successful attack. The 
minotaur may only use his spear or his 
horns and bite. 

When intruders enter the area, the 
minotaur immediately moves to attack. He 
knows this area so well that the only way 
for victims to escape is to go through the 
secret door into area 36., or else to run out 
of the place and climb a large tree. 

The cave the minotaur dwells in has 
skulls and bones arrayed in decorative pat 
terns. The secret door is actually a slab of 
stone which takes not less than 3 humans 


42 



THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


to move. (It will be noticed by careful 
checking of the walls, but discovering how 
it is moved requires a roll of 1 on a six- 
sided die to find where it can be grasped. 
All of the minotaur's treasure is behind 
this slab of rock. It hides: 

1 locked chest (with poison needle in 

lock) - contents 930 gp and 310 ep 

1 staff of healing 

1 man-sized (optionally elf-sized) magic 

plate armor +1 

1 locked coffer - contents 3 potion bot 
tles (gaseous form, delusionary heal 
ing, giant strength) 

1 locked chest - contents 3 pieces of jew 

elry worth 1,600 gp, 900 gp, and 600 
gp, respectively 

J. GNOLL LAIR: The entry into this place is 
a small cave - and only at the end will 
worked stone be visible. If the adventurers 
have a light or make too much noise, the 
gnoll guards (46.) will certainly be alerted 
and ready. 

46. GUARD ROOM: There are always 4 
gnolls (AC 5, HD 2. hp 9 each. #AT 1. 
D 2-8, MV 30', Save F2, ML 8) on duty 
here. Two have bows, will shoot at 
intruders until melee takes place; they will 
then run for help while the other two 
fight. Each gnoll has d8 each cp. sp and cp. 

47. GUARD ROOM: 3 males (AC 5. hp 8 
each, #AT 1. D 2-8, MV 30'. Save F2. ML 
8) and 5 females (AC 6, HD l + l, hp 5 
each. #AT 1, D 1-8, MV 30'. Save Fl, ML 
7) arc quartered here. They will be ready to 
fight immediately. The males have d6 gp 
each, the females have d4. There is a scat 
tering of rude furniture in the place, heaps 
of bedding on the floor, several hides and 
pelts on the walls (one is a valuable sable 
cloak worth 450 gp), and a barrel of water 
in the southwest comer of the room. 

48. LOCKED ROOM: This chamber is a 
store room and armory. Besides the usual 
provisions, there are 7 shields, a suit of 
dwarf-sized chain mail, 12 battle axes, 3 
longbows, 5 quivers of arrows (20 in each), 
and a magic sword (~2 cursed). One bar 
rel of exceptionally fine ale is leaking and 
the odor will tempt adventurers to taste it. 
It is so good, in fact, that there is a 5 in 6 
chance per taste that he or she will draw a 
healthy draught and then spend the next 
1-4 turns drinking. (If this occurs, be sure 
that you have the appropriate characters 


sing, make noise, and act foolishly. Any of 
their attacks will be at -2 to hit; this will 
continue for as many turns as they spend 
drinking i.e. 1-4). 

49. COMMON ROOM: This place quarters 
the gnoll tribe - 6 males (AC 5, HD 2, hp 
8 each. #AT 1. D 2-8, MV 30', Save F2, ML 
8), 11 females (AC 6, HD 1 +1, hp 5 each, 
#ATl,D 1-8. MV30'. Save Fl, ML7). and 
18 young who do not fight. Males have d6 
each of ep and sp, females dlO sp each. 
There is the usual clutter of worthless fur 
niture in the room. 

50. GNOLL CHIEFTAIN S QUARTERS: The 
gnoll leader wears pieces of plate mail (AC 3. 
HD 3, hp 17, #AT 1. D 4-10 (2d4 + 2) due 
to his strength, Save F3, ML 10). With him 
arc his two sons (AC 4 due to chain mail and 
shield, HD 2 +1, hp 10 each, #AT 1. D 3-9 
(2d4 + l), Save F2, ML 10), and 4 females 
(AC 6, HD 1 + 1, hp 5 each, #AT 1, D 1-8. 
MV 30', Save Fl, ML 9). The chieftain has a 
pair of silver armbands worth 50 gp each, 
and there are 39 gp in his belt pouch. His 
sons have dlO each gp, ep. and sp. Each 
female wears as silver neck chain worth 30 gp 
and has 2d6 ep in addition. The furnishings 
of the place are crude and banered. A large 
metal pot beneath a flagstone in the fireplace 
alcove hides 200 cp, 157 sp, 76 ep, and 139 
gP 

The secret door and passage to area K.. 
63., is unknown to all parties. Just inside 
the entrance is the skeleton of a human 
thief; his leg broken, he must have died 
here trying to escape through the secret 
door. The rotten leather armor and corrod 
ed weapons arc valueless, but the purse at 
his belt holds 12 gems of 50 gp base value 
each, and the elven boots upon his bony 
feet are still in usable shape. 

(DM Note: Losses by the gnolls cannot be 
replaced. They have a loose alliance with the 
ores, so any surviving gnolls will move to the 
ore areas and vice versa. If you wish, allow the 
chieftain to be able to escape by climbing up 
the chimney of the fireplace in his area.) 

K. SHRINE OF EVIL CHAOS: A faint, foul 
draft issues from the 20' wide cave mouth 
which is the entrance to this place. The 
worn path through the copse of obscenely 
twisted and oddly bloated trees gives those 
approaching along its length an eerie sense 
of unease, and as soon as they enter the 
cave mouth a dim awareness of lurking evil 
will pervade their senses. Red strata inter 


twines with bulging black veins running 
through the hewn rock walls beyond the 
entrance. The wide corridors and chambers 
are deathly still. A faint groaning sound, 
and a shrill piping may be occasionally 
heard, barely perceptible even if the party 
is absolutely silent and listening. 

The floors are smooth and worn by the 
tread of countless feet of the worshipers at 
this grim place. The footsteps of intruders 
will echo alarmingly in these vaulted halls 
(+ 2 chance of being surprised if no pre 
cautions arc taken), and extreme care must 
be taken to muffle such sounds if the party 
has any hopes of remaining undetected 
until the moment of their choosing. Con 
tinual noise will bring a group of zombie 
guards to investigate: 

8 zombies: (AC 8. HD 2, hp 8 each, #AT 1, 
D 1-8, MV 30'. Save Fl, ML 12). These 
ghastly monsters are clad in filthy red and 
black striped uniforms. Each carries a 
cleaver-tike battle axe. (Each wears an 
amulet of protection from turning, so 
attempts by a cleric to turn them are made 
as if they were ghouls rather than zom 
bies.) 

51. BOULDER FILLED PASSAGE: Large 
rocks and boulders have been placed here 
in order to seal off this tunnel. It will take 
100 man-turns to open a way large enough 
for a human to pass through into the area 
beyond (possibly outside and southwest of 
the Caves of Chaos). 

52. HALL OF SKELETONS: This unusual 
audience chamber has a dais and throne-like 
chair set with 4 large red gems (500 gp each) 
at the south end. It is otherwise empty except 
for a dozen skeletons, clad in rags of chain 
mail and bearing banered shields and rusty 
scimitars, propped against the walls. These 
bony guards do not move, and any attempt 
to turn them immediately upon entering the 
chamber will have no effect, as they are obvi 
ously not animated. However, as soon as 
intruders touch the dais or throne chair, these 
monsters will spring into action from their 
positions on cither wall of the chamber. Each 
has an amulet of protection from turning on 
it, so they are turned by a cleric as if they were 
zombies. (AC 7, HD l, hp 3 each. #AT 1, D 
1-6. Save Fl. ML 12). They have no treasure. 

Once the skeletons are disposed of. it is 
an easy task to pry the 4 garnets (gems)

THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


53. GUARD ROOM: There will always be 8 
zombies (AC 8. HD 2, hp 8 each. #AT 1, 
D 1-8, Save FI, ML 12), turned as if they 
were ghouls due to amulets of protection 
from turning hulking silently here, 4 at 
cither end of the hall. Anyone entering 
will be attacked unless they are robed (see 
area 54., below) and have an amulet iden 
tical to the ones which the undcad guards 
or priests wear. There is no treasure here. 

54. ACOIYTES' CHAMBER: There axe 4 
acolytes (1st level clerics) here (AC 5, Cl, 
hp4 each. #AT 1. D 1-6. ML 8), all dressed 
in rusty red robes with black cowls. Under 
these robes, each wean chain mail and a 
mace at his belt. Each carries 10 gp in his 
purse, and the leader wean an amulet of 
protection from good. This amulet circles 
the wearer with a magical barrier against 
attacks by characters or creatures of other 
alignments by subtracting 1 from the "to 
hit" rolls of these opponents and adding 
+1 to the wearer's saving throws. The 
amulet will also keep out melee attacks 
from enchanted (magical) monsten (such 
as gargoyles), but not missile attacks from 
these creatures. Their room contains four 
hard pallets, a brazier, a table, four stools, 
a cabinet for clothing, a water pail, a waste 
bucket, and a flagon of wine and four 
cups. There is nothing of value amongst 
these items. 

55. EVIL CHAPEL: This place is of red 
stone, the floor being a mosaic checker 
board of black and red. The south wall is 
covered by a huge tapestry which depicts a 
black landscape, barren trees, and uniden 
tifiable but horrible black shapes in silhou 
ette - possibly demons of some sort - 
holding aloft a struggling human. A gray 
sky is tom by wisps of purple clouds, and a 
bloody moon with a skull-like face upon it 
leers down upon the scene. Four blade pil 
lars support the domed ceiling some 25' 
overhead. Between these columns, just in 
front of the tapestry, is a stone altar of red 
veined black rock, rough-hewn and 
stained brown with dried blood. Upon it 
arc 4 ancient bronze vessels - a shallow 
bowl, a pair of goblets, and an ewer, a vase- 
shaped pitcher. They arc also bloodstained 
but obviously worth a great deal of money. 
(The value is 1.000 gp for each cup, and 
2,000 gp for each of the other items, but 
these arc relics of evil, and any character 
possessing them will nor pan with them or 
sell them nor allow others to handle them. 
For each character who picks up one of the 


se objects, the DM should roll a secret sav 
ing throw vs. Spells at -2. Any who save 
successfully will get a "feeling of great 
evil" about the object, and he or she may 
voluntarily put it down. If the save fails, 
the characters will rapidly fall under the 
influence of a demonic spell and within 6 
days become a servant of chaos and evil, 
returning to this chapel to replace the 
relics, and then staying as a guard forever 
after. If someone attempts to destroy these 
relics, the great bell (see 58., below) will 
sound and the Shrine's residents will come 
running in 3 rounds. If a detect evil spell is 
cast upon these items, they will glow an 
ugly purple, and all good characters will 
feel an instant loathing for them. If the 
character who has taken them has a dispel 
magic and then a bless spell cast upon him 
or her, there is a 60% chance of removing 
the evil on the first day, 50% on the 2d, 
40% on the 3rd, 30% on the 4th, 20% on 
the 5th, and 10% on the 6th. Otherwise. 
nothingwill be able to save the character!). 

56. ADEPTS' CHAMBER: There are 4 
adepts (2nd level clerics) here, each clad in 
a black robe with a maroon colored cowl 
(AC 2. C2. hp 8 each, #AT 1. D 1-6, ML 
8). wearing plate mail beneath their gar- 
ments, and each bearing a mace. Their 
waists arc circled with copper chains (worth 
40 gp each) with skull shaped clasps fash 
ioned of bone. Each carries a purse with 20 
gold and 5 platinum pieces, and each 
wears an amulet of protection from good, 
which makes their effective armor class 2 
vs. good creatures. The first and second 
have cause light wounds spells (docs 2-7 
points of damage to creature touched; nor 
mal "to hit" roll must be made to touch 
victim), the third a light spell, the fourth a 
cause fear spell (the victim touched must 
save vs. Spells or flee in terror for 1 turn; a 
normal "to hit" roll must be made to 
touch victim). They will use their spells 
first, if possible, before engaging in com 
bat with weapons. In the room arc four 
beds, four small stands, a table, four 
chairs, four chests for clothing, and various 
books and scrolls of evil nature - nothing 
of value. However, on the table are copper 
dishes and vessels (total weight 300 gp) of 
exceptional craftsmanship which arc worth 
175 gold pieces. (If the party opts to 
destroy the evil writings, they should 
receive an additional 600 experience points 
for the act. unless they are themselves evil, 
in which case they should receive points for 
keeping and reading these works ) If hard 


pressed, these evil clerics will attempt to 
flee and warn their master by striking the 
great bell (58.). 

57. HALL OF UNDEAD WARRIORS: 
There are four files of the undead here, 
two of 10 skeletons each, two of 10 zom 
bies each. The former face south, the latter 
north. 

20 skeletons: AC 6 (due to chain mail tags & 
shields). HD 1. hp 3 each, #AT 1, D 1-6, Save 
FI, ML12, turned as zombies. 

20 zombies: AC 5 (due to chain mail), HD 2, 
hp 8 each. #AT 1, D 1-8, Save Fl; ML 12, 
turned as if they were ghouls. 

Upon the striking of the great iron bell at 58. 
below, the skeletons will issue forth from the 
south door of the place and march into the 
temple (58.) to line the south wall, while the 
zombies plod out the north exit to line the 
north wall of the temple. If intruders enter 
room 57., are in the passage to the temple, or 
are within the temple itself, these undead 
warriors will attack. Proper garments and 
amulets warn by the characters will prevent 
attack unless the cleric commands the undead 
to do so. They have no treasure. 

58. TEMPLE OF EVIL CHAOS: This huge 
area has an arched ceiling some 30' or more 
in height. The floor is of polished black stone 
which has swirling patterns of ted veins 
through it. The walls behind the draperies, 
and the ceiling as well, are of dull black rock, 
while the west wall is of translucent red stone 
which is seemingly one piece, polished to 
minor-like smoothness. A great bell of black 
iron stands near the entrance point, with a 
pair of mallets beside its supports. Lb the 
south arc several long benches or pews. There 
are three stone altars to the west: the north 
west of pure black, the middle one of 
streaked red and black, the last of red with 
black flecks. At the western end of the tem 
ple area is a dais of black stone, with four 
lesser chairs on its lower tier and a great 
throne above. The chairs are of bone; the ivo 
ry throne is set with gold and adorned with 
gems of ted and black (10 black stones each 
worth 100 gp. 10 red stones each worth 500 
gp, and one large ted stone worth 1,000 gp). 
The signs and sigils upon these seats are of 
pure chaos and evil. The other walls are cov 
ered by draperies of deep purple with 
embroidered symbols and evil sayings, done 
in scarlet and gold and black thread. As soon 
as the party enters the place, black candles in 


44 



THE CAVES OF CHAOS 


eight great candelabra on either side of the 
place will come alight magically, shooting 
forth a disgusting red radiance. Shapeless 
forms of purple, yellow and green will dance 
and sway on the western wall, and if anyone 
looks at them for more than a moment, they 
must save vs. Spells or be mesmerized into 
chanting a hymn to chaotic evil. Should three 
or more voices be so raised, the iron bell will 
sound automatically by magic, but even one 
such chant will alert the guards of the head 
cleric (see below). Zombie guards will enter 
here in 3 rounds after the party, even if the 
party is quiet. 

59. THE CHAMBERS OF THE EVIL 
PRIEST: Location 59.g is the anteroom 
where special visitors are entertained by 
the chief cleric. There arc lavish furnish 
ings here, although none are of particular 
value except for a golden flagon and cups 
(flagon worth 500 gp, each of the nine 
cups has 100 gp value). Three zombies are 
on guard here (AC 2 due to plate mail and 
shield, HD 2, hp 13 each, #AT 1, D 1-8. 
Save FI, ML 12). They stand unmoving 
unless they arc summoned by a chant from 
the temple area, someone enters their area, 
or they arc commanded by the evil priest. 

Location 59. is the private chamber of 
the evil priest. He is 3d level, wears magi 
cal armor +1, has a shield +1, and wears 
an amulet of protection from good which 
adds a further +1 to his armor class when 
attacked by good creatures (AC 0 or - 1. 
C3, hp 14, #AT 1, D 2-7 (staff) or 1-6 
(mace), ML 10). He attacks with a snake 
staff, which is +1 to hit. On command, 
the staff will turn into a snake and coil 
around a person hit. The victim is held 
helpless for ld4 turns, or until the cleric 
recalls the the staff. The staff then crawls 
back to the cleric on command. He also has 
a normal mace hanging from his belt. He 
has a gold ring with a black gem (value 
1,400 gp) and a purse with 51 pp in it. He 
wears a black cape and cowl, with red robes 
beneath. His spells are: cause light wounds 
(inflicts 2-7 points of damage) and cause 
fear. The priest must touch the intended 
victim, and successfully roll to hit. for the 
spells to take effect. He also has a scroll 
with three cleric spells on it: detect magic, 
hold person, silence. 15' radius. He has a 
potion of gaseous form which he will use to 
escape through the boulder-filled corridor, 
51., when all else fails. 

His room is furnished lavishly, with red 
carpet, furniture of black wood with velvet 
upholstery of scarlet, and a large bed cov 


ered with silken covers of black and red 
cushions and pillows. A demon idol leers 
from the wall to the north, directly over 
the be bed. If anyone other than the priest 
touches it. it will topple over upon the 
character, causing 2-12 points of damage. 
It has two gem eyes (100 gp value each). 
The evil priest will dan behind a screen in 
the southeast comer, enter a wardrobe 
there, slip through a secret door in its back, 
and then down a shon passage and out 
into the corridor through another secret 
door, should his life be in danger. When 
the secret door in the back of the wardrobe 
is opened by the party, 500 gp and 50 gems 
of 10 gp value each will spill from the 
wardrobe into the room to hopefully cause 
pursuers to stop for the loot. The priest will 
meanwhile either try to rally his forces, or 
else escape (assuming that most of his fel 
lows have been eliminated already). 

60. GUEST CHAMBER: This lower room is 
for important guests of the place. It con 
tains a large bed, table, chairs, etc. There is 
nothing of value within, although the tap 
estries adorning the walls (things picturing 
evil cruelties and obscene rites) appear 
expensive. Beneath a velvet cloth on the 
table is a polished mirror. 

61. TORTURE CHAMBER: There are vari 
ous implements of torture here, both large 
and small - a rack, iron maiden, tongs, 
pinchers, whips, etc. Comfortable chairs 
are scattered along the walls, evidendy so 
placed to allow visitots an enjoyable view 
of the proceedings. The torturer lives in 
the forepart of the place, and he will attack 
unauthorized persons who enter. He is a 
3rd level fighter, hp 19 . with chain mail 
under his black leather garments (AC 5, 
F3. hp 19. #AT 1. D 3-8 (ld6 + 2 due to 
Strength), ML 8). His weapon is a huge 
axe. Hidden in his mattress are 135 gp and 
a bracelet worth 700 gp. 

62. THE CRYPT: The door to this room is 
bolted shut. This long hall is of roughly 
hewn stone, with a low ceiling. In it are 
many coffins and large sarcophagi with the 
remains of servants of the Temple of Evil 
Chaos. The sixth tomb opened will contain 
a wighr. (AC 5. HD 3*, hp 13, #AT 1. D 
drains one level, MV 30'. Save F2, ML 12). 
There is a secret compartment in the 
wight's tomb; this contains a sword +2 a 
scroll of protection from undead, a helm of 
alignment change, and a silver dagger 
worth 800 gp because of the gems set into 


its pommel. 

63. STORAGE CHAMBER: There are many 
piles of boxes, crates, barrels, sacks, and so 
forth here - the supplies of the temple. 
There is nothing of value, and if the party 
stays within the place for longer than 3 
rounds, a gelatinous cube will move from 
the corridor into the place and block it: 
(AC 8, HD 4*. hp 22. #AT 1. D 2-8, plus 
paralyzation. MV 20', Save F2, ML 12). 
Inside the creature arc dl2 each of cp. sp, 
cp, gp, and pp, as well as several bones - 
evidently parts of a victim not yet wholly 
digested. (One of the bones is actually a 
wand of enemy detection with 9 charges 
left. If it is not gotten out of the monster 
within one turn, it will be ruined by diges 
tive juices.) The secret door in the room 
leads to the gnoli chieftain's cave. (50., 
above). 

64. CELL: The door is of iron, locked and 
barred, but a window is set in the door. 
This is the place where prisoners arc kept 
until tortured to death or sacrificed in the 
area above. There are several skeletons still 
chained to the wall, and one scantily clad 
female - a fair maiden obviously in need 
of rescuing! As she is partly around a cor 
ner. at fim only her shapely legs and body 
up to the shoulders can be seen. Those who 
enter and approach closer arc in for a rude 
shock! This is actually a medusa recently 
taken by the evil priest's zombie guards. 
(AC 8. HD 4**. hp 20. #AT l.Dl-6 plus 
poison, MV 30'. Save F4, ML 8). An oppo 
nent hit by the medusa's attack has been 
bitten by the asp-hair and must save vs. 
Poison or die. Those looking at the crea 
ture - including those fighting her from 
the front - must save versus being Turned 
to Stone by the medusa. 

Not being above such things, the cleric 
had plans for removing its snakes, blinding 
it, and then eventually sacrificing it at a 
special rite to a demon. The medusa will 
spare one or two of the adventureis from 
her gaze, promising them she has magic 
which will turn their companions back to 
flesh again, if they will free her from her 
chains. She docs, in fact, have a special 
elixir, a potion of sronc to flesh in a small 
viaJ, enough liquid to turn six persons back 
to normal, but she docs not intend to give 
it away. If freed she will attempt to 
"stone" her rescuers.

INTERLUDE E 


THE SILVER PRINCESS 


Unlike the other adventures in this book, this 
one begins when an Immortal intervenes 
directly in campaign affairs. Thus, the adven 
ture of the Silver Princess can occur at any time 
the DM desires. 

Direct contact with an Immortal is an unusual 
and highly significant affair. Special care should 
be taken to impress the players with the signal 
and wonderous trappings of such contact 

The Immortal 

An immortal is a superior being, seldom seen, 
who influences and manipulates campaign 
events in pursuit of higher goals. Some arc 
benign, some arc malevolent, but all tend to 
work indirectly. In this adventure, the party will 
be contacted by Thcndara. Protector of the Val 
ley of Haven, whose words are given at the 
beginning of the Silver Princess adventure 

The party can be anywhere at the time of 
the contact. First, they will experience a chill 
wind, although there will be no visible signs 
(even torches will not flicker). Motion outside 
the party starts to slow, and their surround 
ings become hazy and indistinct. Other peo 
ple and creatures seem to stop, and the party's 
own motions become dreamlike and slow. A 
glow of light appears, growing and finally 
resolving into a tall woman with dark brown 
hair and faintly green skin- Her features have 
a slightly elvish cast. She has no weapons they 
can see, but an auta of power overlayed with 
gentleness emanates from her As she smiles, 
the light that surrounds her expands to sur 
round the party and they discover they can 
move freely within it. Upon dose examina 
tion, the being seems slightly transparent. At 
this point the adventure begins. 

If any of the parry accepts the Immortal's 
offer, all will be instantly transponed to the pal 
ace of the Silver Princess. Any wounds will be 
instantly healed, and spell casters can tcchoose 
spells if they wish. Effectively, they will be starr 
ing a new adventure at full strength. 

Note: This encounter can be used to save a 
party that faces total destruction. However, 
such intervention must remain very rare if the 
players arc to remain the driving force in your 
campaign. Think carefully about the effect of 
such intervention on play before you decide to 
use it-players lose interest if the DM pulls 
them out of trouble every time they foul up. 
Save this for a time when they play well, but 
are beaten by poor luck (though this, too, is 
pan of the game!) If you do use this encounter 
to save the pany and they won't accept it, let 
them take the consequences.

Player's Background (Read to 
players) 

This is narrated by the Protector, when she 
appears to the players: 


"The valley of Haven was a peaceful 
land. Its crops were abundant, its citizens 
prosperous. Elves. Dwarves, Halflings, 
and Humans lived together in harmony. 
Hidden away in the heart of the Altan Tepe 
Mountains, Haven was a safe place to live. 
The rivers were sweet and pure; the weath 
er was pleasant and warm. 

"One reason Haven was so peaceful was 
due to my presence. 1 am Thcndara, and 1 
am known to the people of the valley as the 
Protector. I am an Immortal and patron of 
the valley. For years without number I have 
warded off evil and helped the crops to 
grow and the valley of Haven to prosper. 
Hear now the talc of Haven. 

"The ruler of Haven was the fair Princess 
Argenta. She lived in a palace made of 
white shining marble, which, when the 
sun set, glowed like silver. Princess Argen 
ta was beloved by all her people. She was 
just, fair and friendly to all. 

"One day, the dwarves of Haven found a 
ruby the size of an apple while digging in a 
new mine. As a token of their devotion, they 
gave the ruby to Princess Argenta. The 
dwarves named the tuby "My Lady's Heart". 
The princess was so pleased with the gift that 
she invited all the valley to attend a celebra 
tion to see the wondrous gem. The dwarves 
were to be the guests of honor. It was to be a 
grand day of feasting and fun. 

"The day before the celebration a 
strange visitor arrived. He flew into the 
valley tiding a white dragon. The rider was 
dressed all in black. He had pale skin, long 
blond hair, and a short blond beard. Since 
Haven was noted for its hospitality, the 
princess invited the stranger to stay at the 
palace. She also granted his request to 
escort her to the celebration. 

"At midnight, disaster struck. Dark 
clouds hid the moon and a freezing wind 
blew through the valley. The crops with 
ered in the fields. Cattle grew sick. The 
valley began to die. I could do nothing. 

"From the palace came an explosion and 
parts of the walls came tumbling down. 
When the dust cleared a ruby glow sur 
rounded the entire palace. 

"Haven now lies in chaos. Raiding 
bands of ores, goblins, and hobgoblins ter 
rorize the countryside. The disaster hap 
pened so suddenly that the people are con- 


46 
















THE SILVER PRINCESS 


fused and helpless. Without their lcadcts. 
who are trapped in the palace, they have 
no courage to fight back. The situation has 
become desperate. 

"Haven is in dire trouble I do not know 
what caused the disaster, but I do know 
that the reason can be found somewhere in 
the palace. Allies of the evil that has 
attacked Haven have challenged me and I 
am under siege. I cannot help Haven, but 
you can. The princess needs you; the peo 
ple of Haven need you. You arc Haven's 
only hope. Find the source of the evil that 
has overtaken Haven, and destroy it. If you 
will go. 1 will open the way into of the pal 
ace for you. I will also give you all the help 
I can, but ray power is limited. The future 
of Haven is in your hands." 

"Please decide quickly, my time here is 
nearly ended. Already evil forces have detect 
ed my sending. Will you come now?" 


Dungeon Master's Background 

The disaster that has struck Haven has been 
caused by the magical ruby that the dwarves 
found. While it was called "My Lady's Heart" 
by the people of Haven, its true name is "The 
Eye of Erik". 

Arik is an ancient, evil being of great power. 
He is also known as Arik of the Hundred Eyes, 
and is sometimes worshipped as a god. For his 
many crimes. Arik was banished to a special 
dimension centuries ago to be imprisoned 
there for all eternity. 

Arik has been seeking to escape from the 
prison dimension through the ages. And he 
desires to take over Haven and enslave all its peo 
ple. He has at last managed to send one of his 
eyes across the dimensional bamers into the 
heart of the mountains. There, the dwarves 
found Arik's ruby eye and brought it to the pal 
ace, not knowing the evil they were bringing to 
their beloved valley. The ruby, though larger 
chan most gems, looks like any other ruby and 
though the Protector would have sensed the evil, 
by the time the ruby's influence was felt, it was 
too late. Arik had already struck. 

The ruby is linked to Arik. It has allowed 
him to channel some of his evil magical power 
past the dimensional barriers into Haven and 
the power of the ruby attracts evil, chaotic 
monsters. Arik hopes to use the ruby "eye." 
when the time is right, to open the way and 
cross the dimensional border. 

The power of the ruby has killed the crops 
and brought disease to the animals. It has 
drawn ore, goblin, and hobgoblin hordes into 
Haven to fight for its master. It has even 
brought the evil cleric, Catharandamus into 


the palace, to prepare the ceremony that will 
allow Arik to cross the dimensional barriers. 
The ruby has turned many of the palace 
inhabitants to stone and trapped the princess 
and the mysterious stranger inside itself. 
Finally, the ruby has created a magical field 
around the palace to prevent help from arriv 
ing and stopping Catharandamus. 

The Protector will opien a way through the 
ruby glow, and will also open a safe passage out, 
if the party chooses to leave the palace to rest and 
recover spells and hit points The Protector will, 
however, state that it is a drain of power and the 
way can only be opened a few times. 

Ellis the Strong and Ariksbane 

The mysterious stranger in black armor who 
arrived just before the disaster struck is named 
Ellis the Strong (AC 2; F 3; hp 21; #AT 1; 
D 1-10 + 3; MV 20'; ML9; ALL; Sl8,19. W12. 
D13. Cl6. Chl5). Ellis is a Knight of the White 
Drakes, a special band of fighters from Thyatis 
who ride white dragons and are dedicated to 
defeating evil wherever it exists. The characters 
have heard stones of them. He wears black plate 
mail armor and wields a two-handed sword. His 
dragon steed is known as Ariksbane (AC 3; HD 
6; hp 30; #AT 3; D l-4/l-4/2d8; MV 30'. Fly 
80'; ML 8; AL N). Ellis and Ariksbane came to 
Haven because they had heard of the great ruby 
and suspected that the ruby was one of the leg 
endary eyes of Arik. Before they could be sure, 
they were caught by the power of the ruby and 
defeated. Ellis is now trapped inside the ruby 
with Princess Aigcnia. Ariksbane has been ban 
ished to another dimension. 

Destroying the Ruby 

The party must, at some point during the 
adventure, discover or figure out how to 
destroy the ruby Eye of Arik. There are several 
clues and aids throughout the dungeon. How 
ever, if through bad luck the party appears to 
be missing most of these, "a vision from the 
Protector" can be used to give hints to steer 
them in the right direction. 

There are three ways that the party can 
destroy the "Eye of Arik" and defeat the evil. 
The name Ariksbane means "the min of 
Arik." And if the dragon is freed it can use its 
frost breath, if the dragon wishes, to destroy 
the ruby without harming anyone near the 
ruby (or trapped inside it). The ruby can be 
shattered by using the Sword of Arik, if this 
can be found. Catharandamus is using the 
sword as pan of the ceremony to free Arik. If 
the sword is used to shatter the ruby it will be 
destroyed at the same time. Finally, two notes 
played on the Ice Harp will summon the min 
strel Rowena (see room 32). Rowcna is one of 


the legends of Haven. She was a famous min 
strel who left Haven years ago to visit the Pro 
tector. Time does not flow the same with the 
Protector as in the rest of the world. Though 
she has lived with the Protector for many 
years, she is little older than the day she left 
Haven. Rowena knows the proper notes to 
play on the Ice Harp to shatter the ruby. 

If the ruby is destroyed, by any one of the 
three possible means, the evil curse which has 
befallen Haven will be lifted. Those people 
turned to stone by the ruby will return to nor 
mal. Princess Argcnta and Ellis the Strong will 
be freed and return to normal size. If Ariks- 
banc has not already been freed, the dragon 
will be freed when the ruby is destroyed. The 
hordes of chaotic monsters invading Haven 
will flee in terror. The crops will grow again 
and the animals will be cured. A grateful Prin 
cess Argcnta will reward the characters with a 
special medal of honor plus 3.000 gp each. 

DUNGEON LEVEL ONE 

The DM may expand on the detail of this 
adventure by describing what rooms and 
items found look like: what do the floor and 
walls look like, what are they made of, what is 
in the room? He or she may also wish to 
change or add things to this dungeon. But be 
careful that any changes made do not make 
the dungeon too dangerous or give the players 
treasure that makes them too powerful. 

WANDERING MONSTERS 

Every other turn, the DM should make a check 
for a wandering monster. A roll of 1 on ld6 
indicates an encounter has occurred. The 
monster will first be seen 20-120 {2d6x 10) feet 
away when encountered, though the monster 
may surprise the party by stepping through a 
door, or waiting around a comer Use the spe 
cial table given below to determine the type of 
monster encountered. 

Acolyte: Acolytes arc 1st level NPC clerics. 
The acolytes encountered as wandering mon 
sters will all be clerics of Arik. If there arc 4 or 
more encountered they will be led by either a 
2nd or 3rd level cleric. To determine which, 
roll ld6. A roll of 1-4 indicates a 2nd level 
leader. A roll of 5-6 indicates a 3rd level lead 
er. The DM can choose any clerical spells for 
the leader, or they may be rolled at random. 

The clerics of Arik all wear blood-red robes 
with large hoods that hide the faces of the cler 
ics. The robes are decorated with 100 eyes. 
Beneath the robes the clerics wear plate mail. 
They all carry shields painted with a single 
large red eye.

Bandits: Bandits arc NPC thieves who have 
joined together to rob others. Bandits will act as 
normal humans, lost and wandering in the pal 
ace, to surprise their intended victims. These 
particular bandits have been drawn to Haven by 
the Eye of Arik. If the DM chooses, the bandits 
may be led by a 2nd or 3rd level thief. 

Bear, Black: Black bears have black fur and 
stand about 6' tall. They are omnivorous (will 
eat almost anything), but prefer roots and 
berries. A black bear will not usually attack 
unless it is cornered and cannot escape. This 
particular black bear has wandered into the 
caverns below the palace and was trapped 
there by the red glow from the ruby. The bear 
is extremely hungry. If the party gives him 
food, he will not attack. 

Koboki: These kobolds have been attracted by 
the "Eye of Arik." They hope to join in the loot 
ing and pillaging when Arik takes over the valley. 
Ores: These ores have gathered to fight for Arik 
when he finally enters Haven. They will help any 
clerics of Arik, if the clerks are in trouble. 
Skeletons: The Eye of Arik has released hordes 
of undcad usually kept away by the Protector. 

PLAYER'S START 


Approximately a half-mile from the palace 
you can see that pan of the structure's left side 
has been destroyed. Stone blocks and rubble 
cover the mountain side. Almost all of the cas 
tle and many parts of the surrounding land 
glow a soft ted. All plant life, except some 
strange-looking thorn bushes with white roses, 
has died where the ruby glow radiates. 

As you travel closer to the palace, a trail 
untouched by the ruby glow appears. The 
trail leads directly to the entrance of the 
palace. The main entryway into the palace 
is the only pan of the palace that docs not 
glow red. The massive, barred portcullis 
that usually blocks the entrance is raised. 

There is a quick, funivc movement to your 
right, as your party startles a rat near the 
entrance. The small beast darts out into the 
glowing area, suddenly stop*, shakes a bit. 
and dies. You notice the remains of other 
small unfortunate creatures inside this red 
zone. 


Any player characters who enter or touch the red 
area must make a save vs. Spells. If successful, 
the character takes no damage. If unsuccessful, 
the character takes 1-6 points of damage. A new 
saving throw is required each round the charac 
ter is in the red area. Evil creatures of Arik arc 
immune to the effects of the red glow. 

If the player characters search the entrance, 
they will find a small, almost invisible wire 
stretched across the 30-foot wide entrance, 3 
inches above the ground. If the wire is tripp>ed 
(automatic if the party just walks in without 
searching), a small dart shoots out of a con 
cealed niche in the rocks. If there is a target in 
the entranceway, the dan will hit a character 
on a 10 or better rolled on a 20-sidcd die, 
inflicting 1-4 points of damage. 

1. ENTRANCE HALL 


You pass beneath the raised pioncullis and 
enter the palace proper. The gateyard is a 
large open area surrounded by 20-foot tall 
rock walls, running 30 feet from east to 
west and 40 long. There arc doors to the 
cast and west, 20 feet from the entryway. 
Both doors are made of wood and rein 
forced with iron bars. There are two 
smaller portcullises in the south wall, 10' 
wide and 20' high. One is set in the west 
ernmost ten feet of the south wall, the oth 
er in the easternmost ten feet of the south 
wall. There is 10 feet of solid stone wall 
between the two portcullises. 


As soon as the last character enters the palace, 
read the following to the players: 


As the last member of your band passes 
beneath the gates, the portcullis crashes 
down behind the party, removing any 
chance of escape by that means. The ruby 
glow you noted before now covers the path 
to the palace and the pioncullis, but does 
extend into the palace itself. 


Any character trying to move the pioncullis 
will find it will not budge, and will in addi 
tion suffer the effects of touching the red 
zone. 


Both wooden doors are shut. If the charac 
ters successfully try to hear any noise behind 
the door, they will hear scratching and squeak 
ing behind the western door (room 3) and the 
slow clank of chains behind the eastern door 
(room 4), respicctively. 

The southern portcullises cannot be raised 
by hand, though they will not harm the char 
acter touching them. Each of the portcullises 
are marked with the letters "A + B" and an 
arrow pointing upward. These refer to the 
levers found in rooms 2 and 3. When both 
levers tn these rooms are in the "up" position, 
a grinding noise occurs and the portcullises 
will retract into the ceiling, allowing the party 
to enter the palace proper. 

2. EAST ROOM 


You opien the door to reveal a 20 foot by 20 
foot room. There is a lever in the center of 
the south wall. At the center of the room is 
a 3-foot long gray rat who regards you with 
reddish eyes. 


There is a single giant rat in the room (AC 7; 
HD 1; hp4; MV 40'; #AT 1 D 1-3+ disease; 
ML 8; AL N). It is very hungry. If the party 
throws the rat some food, it will ignore the 
party and gobble down the rations. Otherwise 
it will attack. 

The lever in the south wall can be moved up 
or down. Its current position is down. The 
"up" position is marked by an "A" carved 
into the rock. For the effects of this lever, see 
room 1. Remember that the gates south will 
raise only if both levers are in the "up" posi 
tion. 

3. WEST ROOM 


You open the door to reveal a 20 by 20 foot 
room with a large wooden lever in the 
southern wall. In the center of the room 
are a pair of skeletons. Long iron chains 
dangle from their wrists, and they carry 
curved swords. 


The two skeletons (AC 7; HD 1; hp 5 each; 
MV 20'; #AT 1; D 1-6; Save Fl; ML 12; AL C) 
are undcad. and cannot be affected by sleep or 
charm magics, though they can be turned. 

The lever on the southern wall is similar to 
that in room 2, except that the "up" position 
is marked by a "B" instead of an "A". If the 
levers in this room and room 2 arc both moved 
to the "up" position, the gates to the south 
will raise.

THE SILVER PRINCESS 


4. SECRET ROOM 


The secret panel slides back to reveal a 10 
by 10 room littered with equipment: 2 sets 
of chain mail, a shield, a sword, a cross 
bow. and 20 crossbow bolts. 


The equipment is in good condition, and was 
left by a previous group of adventurers as a 
storage cache that they never returned to. 

5. LIBRARY 


Reed pens, dried ink wells, and scraps of 
paper litter this large room. There arc sev 
eral huge oak tables overturned in the 
southeast corner. This room appears to 
have been some kind of study, classroom or 
library. You do not see any books or scrolls, 
however. 


Hidden behind the tables is a family of five 
kobolds (AC 7; HD 1/2; hp 3 each; MV 40'; 
#AT 1; D 14; Save NM; ML 6; AL C). If the 
party decides to search the room, or they dis 
cover the kobolds by accident, the kobolds 
will fight to defend their lair. Otherwise, they 
will remain hidden until the danger passes. 
Buried in the litter are 50 copper pieces. 

6. STOREROOM 


This room looks like a storeroom. Its 
shelves are filled with large sacks. A dozen 
barrels are stacked against one wall. 


If the players examine the sacks, they will find 
the sacks are filled with grain. The barrels are 
filled with beer. Except for the stored goods, 
the room is empty. 

7. PANTRY 


This area looks like a pantry. Wooden 
plates, spoons, knives, and other utensils 
are scattered around the room. Broken 
pots liner the floor. You see five small, 
incredibly ugly, human-like beings open 
ing drawers and cabinets and tossing 
things on the floor. The creatures have pale 
eanhy colored skin. Their eyes are red and 
glow in the dark. 


The 5 human-like creatures arc goblins (AC 6; 
HD 1-1; hp 4 each; MV 20'; #AT 1; D 1-6; 
Save NM; ML 7; AL C). The goblins are loot 
ing the kitchen for valuables. So far they have 
found nothing. As a result, they arc very 
angry. 

Goblins normally live underground. In full 


daylight they fight with a penalty of -1 on 
their "to hit" rolls. Torch light, lantern light 
or a light spell is not equal to full daylight and 
will not affect them. Goblins hate dwarves 
and will attack them on sight. 

8. DINING HALL 


This room appears to be a dining hall. 
Seated around a large table are twenty 
statues. The statues look like men and 
women eating supper. One statue is cut 
ting meat, another is drinking from a wine 
cup, and so forth. The food on the table is 
not stone. The food is cold and stale, but 
no moldy or decayed. 


When Arik sent his power to this dimension 
through the ruby, his power turned most of 
the palace inhabitants into stone statues. This 
group of people were earing supper at the 
time. There is neither monster nor treasure in 
the room. 

9. HOBGOBLIN BARRACKS 

If the party listens at the door first, they will 
hear arguing, which any who speak hobgob 
lins will recognize as that language. No roll for 
listening needs to be made. 


This room holds six beds. Musty, ragged 
blankets lie on the beds. Six footlockers 
(small wooden chests) rest at the foot of the 
beds. A half-dozen creatures sit on the 
beds arguing. The six creatures are human 
like and man-sized, though incredibly 
ugly. Their skin is an eanh color and they 
appear very brutish. 


The six creatures arc hobgoblins (AC 6; HD 
1 + 1; hp 6 each; MV 30'; #AT I; Dl-8; Save 
Fl; ML 8; AL C). The hobgoblins have moved 
into the old barracks which once housed the 
palace guards. 

10. DESERTED BARRACKS 


This room contains the remains of bunks, 
bl ank ets wooden tables and stools which 
have been broken. Five corpses liner the 
floor. Two of the bodies are human, 
dressed like palace guards. The other three 
corpses ate of a small human-like race with 
grotesque faces and livid gray skin. 


This room was a barracks for palace guards 
men. The two dead men had been patrolling 
outside the palace when the disaster struck. 
They managed to rush back inside before the 
red glow surrounded the palace. Unfortu 


nately they ran into a party of goblins who 
sneaked into the palace through the lower 
caverns and were looting the barracks. 

After a short, bloody fight both men were 
killed, but not before they killed three gob 
lins. The remainder of the goblins, in a fit of 
rage, smashed all the furniture in the room. 
The room is presently empty of treasure and 
live monsters. 

11. CAVERN ENTRANCE 


Wind whistles softly through this dark 
damp cave carrying with it a musky smell. 
Straw is scattered about the floor, along 
with jagged bones. Chained to one wall is a 
large ape with pale white fur. As soon as it 
secs you it begins to rattle its chain and 
roar. 


The white ape (AC 6; HD 4; hp 18; MV 40'; 
#AT 2; D14/ M; Save F2; ML 7; AL N) used 
to guard the entrance to the caverns. It was fed 
regularly and became something of a pci. It 
would nor attack anyone wearing a guard uni 
form. Unfortunately, the white ape has not 
been fed for many days. If the party gives the 
ape food, the white ape will not attack. The 
ape's chain is long enough that there is not 
enough room to pass without being attacked. 

12. OAKEN CABINET 


An oaken cabinet sits against the west wall 
of this hexagonal room. The cabinet is 
carved with scenes of springtime in Haven. 
The floor of the room is white marble, 
veined with black and gold. 


The cabinet is filled with pale green towels 
and pink bars of soap carved into dolphins. 
Hidden under the towels is a spitting cobra 
(AC 7; HD 1; hp 3; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-3 + 
poison; Save Fl; ML 7; AL N). The cobra is 
asleep. It will attack if it is disturbed, other 
wise it will remain quiet. 

A spitting cobra is a 3' long, grayish-white 
snake that can spit a stream of venom up to 6'. 
It aims for its victim's eyes. If the spit hits, the 
victim must save vs. Poison or be blinded. If 
the DM wishes, he or she can have the cobra 
bite, instead of spit poison. The damage 
caused (1-3 points) refers only to when the 
cobra bites, if the cobra bites instead of spit 
ting, the victim must save vs. Poison or die in 
1-10 turns (instead of being blinded). Next to 
the spitting cobra is a large golden key worth 
150 gp.

THE SILVER PRINCESS 


13. SUNKEN BATH 


This hexagonal room contains a large sunk 
en bath filled with water. The sunken bath 
is made of white marble veined with black 
and gold. The walls of this room arc lav 
ishly decorated with murals of water 
nymphs, ponds with long reeds, and 
hunters stalking water birds. In one comer 
of the room are seven flasks and a large 
peacock feather fan. Flying above the bath 
you sec five birdlike creatures. The crea 
tures resemble small feathered antcaters. 
with long noses. 


The 5 birdlike creatures arc stirges (AC 7; HD 
1; hp 5 each; MV 60'; "AT 1; D 1-3; Save F2; 
ML 9; AL N). When a surge attacks a creature, 
it thrusts its beak into the victim's body to 
suck out blood for 1-3 points of damage. A 
successful hit means that it has attached itself 
to the victim and will automatically suck 
blood for 1-3 points of damage per round 
until cither it or its victim is dead. If its victim 
dies, it will leave. A flying stirge gains a bonus 
of + 2 to hit on its Erst attack against any one 
opponent, due to its speed 

If the party investigates the seven flasks, 
they will find that six of the flasks contain 
scented bath oil in different colors. The last 
flask is a potion of ESP. 

14. PINK PEDESTAL 


Upon entering this room, the first thing 
you notice is a small, pink marble pedestal 
five feet tall. Light gleams from a small 
object atop the pedestal. The object is sil 
ver in color. Other than the pedestal the 
room seems to be empty. 


When a character gets within one foot of the 
pedestal, a green glow will surround the ped 
estal. In the midist of the glow you see the 
transparent face of the Protector. The Protec 
tor warns the party to ''Beware!" then disap 
pears along with the green glow. 

On top of the pedestal is a small silver pen 
dant on a silver chain. If a character reaches 
out to touch the pendant he or she will hear 
hysterical laughter which seems to come from 
the pendant. Any character who actually 
touches the pendant must make a save vs. 
Spells or be driven insane. The insanity will 
mainly consist of suicidal bravery, always 
charging into deadly battles, accompanied by 
hysterical laughter. There is no known cute for 
the madness (unless the DM chooses to make 
one up). 

The silver pendant once belonged to 
Silvcrheart. the alchemist. When used by 


Silverheart, the pendant was magical because 
it contained pan of his spirit. The power of 
the Eye of Arik warped the magic of the silver 
pendant. Through Arik's evil influence, it 
drove Silverhean insane. 

At the time that Silverhean went insane, he 
was in the midst of an imponant alchemical 
experiment. Because of his insanity, the exper 
iment produced disastrous results. The entire 
section of the palace (on level 2) where he was 
working exploded. Silverhean and those peo 
ple in that section of the palace at the time 
were killed. All that remains of the section of 
the palace where Silverhean worked is rubble. 
The only thing to survive the explosion was 
the pendant which was teleported to the ped 
estal by the power of the Eye of Arik. The pen 
dant lies and waits for more victims. 

15. MOSAIC ROOM 


This hexagonal room is decorated with 
mosaic tiles. The mosaic covets the entire 
room, the walk, the floor and the ceiling. 
One scene shows a man in black plate 
armor riding a white dragon. A young 
woman wearing a golden crown is riding in 
front of the man. Another scene shows 
elves playing in some woods while a white 
dragon watches them from a hiding place 
behind two tall pines. On another wall is a 
scene showing a pool of bright blue water. 
Several mermaids swim and frolic in the 
water. The design on the floor shows the 
crowned maiden, the man in black armor, 
and the white dragon asleep around a key 
hole. All the mosaics look new. 


Once the party has entered the room, if they 
examine the mosaic, the keyhole in the floor 
will emit a blue white glow which will last 
until a key is placed into the keyhole. If the 
players use any key other than the gold key 
from room 12, ot fail when trying to pick the 
lock, a stone slab will fall from the ceiling over 
the spot where the keyhole is located. Any 
character caught by the stone will suffer 2-12 
points of damage. 

If the gold key is placed in the keyhole, 
another keyhole will appear on the cast wall. 
The second keyhole is also opened by the gold 
key. Once the key is placed in this second lock 
and turned, the mosaic, keyhole, and key will 
vanish. A long silvery sword, floating in the 
air, will appear in their place. The sword glows 
with a bright blue white light. If a character 
reaches out to touch the swotd, the man in 
black plate mail will suddenly appear beside 
the sword and artack the character attempting 
to take the sword. The man will attack like a 
10 hit dice monster. 


The man is an illusion and will disappear 
after 4 rounds or when it is touched by a char 
acter. Touch does not mean hitting it in com 
bat, it means touching the illusion with a bare 
hand. Characters hit by the illusion will 
believe that they have actually taken damage 
and will feel 'hun,' - though no damage will 
actually be taken. The illusion cannot be hit 
in combat. 

Once the illusion disappears, the sword will 
drop to the floor. It still glows. All characters 
will immediately discover that they took no 
damage, and characters who may have been 
"killed' will discover that they are actually 
alive and were only asleep. If the characters 
decide to touch the sword again, nothing will 
happen to them and the sword will "feel 
good" in their hands. The sword will always 
glow when not sheathed. There is no sheath 
for it in this room, nor will it fit into a sheath 
not specifically made for it. The magically 
glowing sword is a +1 weapon. It casts 
enough light to sec for 30'. The weapon 
belonged to Ellis. He still wears the sheath (he 
is trapped inside the Eye of Arik). 

16. STEAM ROOM 


This room is filled with a thick mist. The 
room seems hotter than normal. 


The mist is actually steam and is safe to walk 
through This is a steam room. The steam rises 
from a geyser underneath the room. Once 
inside the room, the party will find that there 
arc wooden benches along the walls. The 
room holds no monsters, traps, or treasure. 

17. CAVERN TEMPLE 


The cavern opens into a large cave. The 
cave floor and walls have been polished 
smooth. Several statues once rested on a 
raised platform along the west wall. The 
statues seem to have been of three people 
kneeling in from of the Protector. They arc 
bestowing gifts on the Protector. Now, 
however, the statues have been smashed. 
In their place is the crude clay statue of a 
large eye. The eye has been painted blood 
red. 


Hidden under the rubble of the broken 
statues is a giant centipede (AC 9; HD 1 / 2; hp 
2; MV 20'; #AT 1; D poison; Save NM; ML 7; 
AL N). If a character tries to move the rubble 
by hand, the giant centipede will be disturbed 
and attack. If the rubble is moved from a dis 
tance (with a spear, pole or similar item), the 
centipede will scurry out of the room without 
attacking

THE SILVER PRINCESS 


18. UNDERGROUND POOL 


Most of this cave is filled with a pool of 
water. A small ledge circles the pool, run 
ning along the east wall of the cave. The 
ledge is only wide enough for one person 
to walk along it without falling into the 
water. In the middle of the pool you sec a 
disturbance in the water. There are several 
3' long creatures swimming toward you. 
The creatures look like weasels. 


The disturbance is caused by 3 giant ferrets 
(AC 5; HD 1 +1; hp 6 each; MV 50'; #AT 1; 
D 1-8; Save Fl; ML 8; AL N). Giant ferrets 
usually hunt giant rats underground. Unfor 
tunately. they are highly unpredictable, and 
they may attack the party if their reaction to 
the party is low enough. 

The water in the cave is fresh. The pool is 
fed by a stream which enters from the south. 
The ledge ends where the stream enters the 
pool. The party can go no further along the 
stream, for it has the same red glow as the land 
outside. 

19. GREEN SLIME 


The walls of this room are covered with 
green, oozing slime. Except for the slime, 
the room appears to be empty. 


The oozing slime is green slime (AC can 
always be hit; HD 2*; hp 9; MV 1'; tf AT 1; D 
special; Save Fl; ML 12; AL N). Green slime 
can be only harmed by fire or cold; it cannot 
be hurt by any other attacks. It dissolves wood 
and metal (in 6 rounds), but cannot dissolve 
stone. Once in contact with flesh, green slime 
will stick and turn the flesh into green slime. 
It cannot be scraped off. but must be burnt 
off. If it is not burned off, the victim will turn 
completely into green slime 1-4 rounds after 
the green slime first came into contact with 
the flesh. Burning green slime while it is on 
the victim causes 1 / 2 damage to the slime and 
1/2 damage to the victim. 

20. SULFUR POOL 


This small cave is largely filled with a bub 
bling gray pool of liquid. The cave smells 
foul. The pool is surrounded by coarse red 
sand. The sandy ledge surrounding the 
pool on the south and west sides, is only 
wide enough for one person to stand on 
without touching the liquid. 


The liquid is water, but the water has a very 
high content of sulfur. Because of the sulfur 


bubbles, the air here is not safe to breathe for 
long periods of time. Anyone staying in the 
room for one full turn will begin to feel dizzy. 
If they do not leave in the next round they will 
take 1 point of damage for each round they 
remain in the room without getting fresh air. 
If the party searches the room they will find 
that some unfortunate individual once fell 
into the pool. The victim is now nothing but 
bones. The victim clutches a leather bag. The 
bag is filled with 133 gp and a silver wolf 
headed ring with two small sapphires for eyes 
(worth 300 gp). 

21. STOREROOM 


This room contains shelves along the south 
and west walls. The shelves arc filled with 
wooden crates. Otherwise, the room 
appears to be empty. 


The crates arc filled with iron rations. Each 
week's worth of iron rations is packed in a sep 
arate tin. The iron rations were used by the 
palace guards when they went on long patrols 
through the countryside. Except for the iron 
rations, the room is empty. 

22. BLOCKED EXIT 


This area seems to have been in some kind 
of explosion or earthquake. Stairs once led 
up out of this area. Rubble covers the floor 
and blocks the stairs. Through cracks in the 
rubble, you catch a faint glimpse of a red 
glow outside the palace. 


This is pan of the area devastated by the alche 
mist Silverheart when he went insane and his 
experiment proved a disaster (sec room 14). 
Though this area is actually below the experi 
mental rooms, it was still caught in the explo 
sion. Even if the characters clear the rubble, 
they would still have to face the red glow 
which surrounds the palace if they tried to use 
this exit. 

23. SECRET ROOM 


Four statues dominate the room, one in 
each corner. Each statue is of a young girl 
in a different pose. No two statues look 
alike. Between the two statues on the cast 
wall is a plush chair. Four smaller chairs 
surround the central chair. A leather- 
covered book rests on the central chair. 
Between the statues on the north wall you 
see a 4' long beetle with a striped shell 
resembling a tiger's skin. 


The monster is a giant tiger beetle (AC 3; HD 
51 


3 + 1; hp 15; MV 50'; #AT 1; D 2-12; Save Fl; 
ML 9; AL N). Tiger beetles are carnivorous 
(meat-eaten) and have been known to attack 
humans when starving. They attack with a 
pair of powerful mandibles. The book on the 
chair is the diary of Princess Argcnta. It stops 
on the day before disaster struck Haven. The 
final entry reads; 

"Today my love arrived tiding his noble 
dragon like the great hero he is. He swept me 
into his arms and proposed marriage. Natu 
rally I acted reluctant. It wouldn't do to seem 
too enthusiastic. But when 1 saw the forlorn 
look on his face I immediately relented. We 
kissed, then set the wedding date. We will be 
married in two weeks, when Ellis' service with 
the Knights of the White Drakes ends. We 
will invite the entire valley." 

This was one of the rooms where Argenta 
often went to escape the duties of court life. 
When the disaster struck Argenta, along with 
Ellis, were magically shrunken and trapped 
inside the ruby. Both of them arc still alive 
and will return to normal if the ruby is 
destroyed. The four statues in the room are 
Argenta's ladies in waiting who were turned to 
stone when the disaster struck. 

24. FOUNTAIN ROOM 


There is a small fountain of water in one 
corner of this room. Tapestries hang along 
both the north and south walls; one shows 
a scene of a young maiden with golden hair 
sitting on a silver throne. Upon her head 
rests a crown of silver and rubies. In one 
hand she holds a silver scepter and in the 
other she holds a large ruby. The other tap 
estry shows a warrior in black plate mail 
resting casually in a wooden chair deco 
rated with carvings. His feet are propped 
upon a stool. 


The two tapestries show Princess Argenta and 
the warrior Ellis the Strong. Except for the 
fountain, the rest of the room is empty. The 
fountain contains only water. 

25. ANTEROOM 


In this room is a 10' wide semi-circular 
alcove. On either side of the alcove stands 
the statue of a warrior. 


The two statues arc actually living crystal 
statues (AC 4; HD 3; hp 14; MV 30'; /AT 2; 
D 1-6/1-6; Save F3; ML 11; ALL). Living crys 
tal statues are life forms made of crystals, 
instead of flesh. While they look just like nor 
mal statues, they arc actually living beings. 
Whenever this room is entered the DM should 










THE SILVER PRINCESS 


roll a monster reaction (2d6). On a roll of 5 or 
less, the statues will attack. 

26. SCHOOLROOM 


The toom contains several wooden desks and 
chairs. Against one wall is a blackboard. 


This room was a schoolroom for the children 
in the palace. It is empty of monsters or trea 
sure. 

27. TRAPPED PASSAGE 


This small chamber is more of a passageway 
than a room. It is very cramped and there arc 
several sets of empty shelves on the walls. 


The pit trap in the floor of this storage passage 
will be activated by the first person to step 
onto it. and triggered by the second one who 
steps onto it. Once triggered, the floor will 
swing open and drop whatever is on it into a 
10' deep pit. The cover will then swing back 
and lock shut. Anyone falling into the pit will 
take ld6 points of damage. 

If the first person who walks across the trap 
door reaches the other side before the second 
one tries, only the second person will fall in, 
otherwise both will fall in. 

After one round, small openings will appear 
in the pit walls, and oil will pour into the pit. 
The oil will continue to pour forth until it fills 
the floor of the pit 1 ' deep. Another wall open 
ing will now appear and a torch (unlit) will fall 
into the oil. (When the palace was occupied, the 
torch would have been lit.) 

The pit cannot be opened from inside. It can 
be opened from the outside using release mecha 
nisms hidden inside secret compartments on the 
inside of either doorway. Check to see if any par 
ty member discovers the secret doors of the com 
partments. The release mechanism is a simple 
button that needs to be pressed. The stone cover 
will then slide back. If the party decides to try to 
smash the stone covet, it will take 10 turns to do 
so; toll for wandering monsters five times before 
the pit is opened. 

28. LIBRARY 


You see shelves covering most of the walk. 
The shelves arc filled with books and 
scrolk. There arc also a number of wooden 
tables and chairs in the room. You notice 
that the room has more candles to light it 
than is usual. The candles are not lit at 
present. Against the south wall is a fire 
place which is also unlit. 


This room is the palace library. Since the stu 


dents sometimes used the library both day 
and night, there arc extra candles in the room. 

Clinging to the ceiling is a giant crab spider 
(AC 7; HD 2*; hp 9; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-8 + 
poison; Save Fl; ML 7; AL N). Giant crab spi 
ders have chameleon-like powers and can 
change their color to blend into their sur 
roundings. They will surprise the party on a 
roll of 1-4 on ld6. After the first attack, a crab 
spider can be seen and attacked normally. 
Crab spiders are carnivorous (meat-eaters). 
Any victim bitten by a crab spider must save 
vs. Poison or die in 1-4 turns. However, their 
poison is weak, and the victim may add + 2 to 
the saving throw roll. 

If the party searches the books and scrolk 
carefully (which will take a full 3 turns), they 
will find that one scroll is a magic-user/elf 
spell scroll. The scroll contains the second 
level spell; web. 

29. FITTING ROOM 


In the center of thk room k a folding 
screen with three panek. The screen k five 
feet high and six feet wide. From behind 
the screen you hear a forlorn wailing 
sound. Behind the screen you sec two 
vaguely human shadows. The shadows arc 
about four and one half feet tall and have 
no heads or arms. Their legs arc indkunct. 
The eerie shadows dance wildly about. 


The shadows are caused by a lit lamp behind 
the screen, shining on two dressmakers' dum 
mies. Each dummy has a sleeveless dress on it 
ready for alteration. The dummies themselves 
arc merely carved wooden torsos mounted on 
platforms of metal rods so that they stand 
roughly the height of a woman. Since the 
dummies have no heads or arms they do not 
cast shadows of heads or arms. The shadowy 
legs are indistinct because of the dress hang 
ing down. The shadows are dancing because a 
breeze k blowing through the open door mak 
ing a forlorn wailing sound. 

The screen k a dressing screen. Members of 
thk palace family and their retainers dressed 
behind it during fittings. The rest of the room 
contains bolts of cloth, ribbons, pin cushions, 
needles, etc. 

30. BUTCHER'S ROOM 


The floor of thk room k covered with blood 
stained sand. A rack on the north wall holds a 
number of large knives and meat cleavers. In 
the center of the room k a large wooden 
block about 2' high, 3' long, and 2' wide. 
The wooden block k also bloodstained 


Thk room k a butchering room. Meat k 
butchered here, then stored in the ice cavern 
(room 31). Underneath the sand k a pit trap 
door in the floor. The trap door stands in front 
of the butcher's block. Anyone who walks on 
the door has a chance of accidently causing it 
to open. Roll ld6 for each character walking 
over the trap door. It will open if a 1 or 2 k 
rolled. The trap door k used to get rid of 
refuse. The door opens to a chute which leads 
below to an underground river. Anyone open 
ing the door will fall down the chute to the 
river below. The river k only 2' deep, but any 
one falling down the chute will take ld6 dam 
age from the fall. 

The underground river channel k blocked 
by a heavy iron grill. Anyone falling into the 
river will be swept against the grill by the pow 
erful current. Fortunately the grill k too small 
for characters to be swept through. 

Three giant rats (AC 7; HD 1 / 2; hp 3 each; 
MV 20'; #AT 1; D 1-3; Save NM; ML8; ALN) 
are also trapped in the underground passage. 
They are desperate and in a state of panic. 
They will immediately attack. There k a 1 in 
20 chance that any one of the giant rats carries 
a disease. If an individual k bitten by a dk- 
cascd rat the victim must make a save vs. Poi 
son. If the save faik, the victim will either die 
in 1-6 days or be sick in bed (unable to adven 
ture) for one month. Roll ld4; the disease k 
only deadly on a result of l. 

If the underground passage is searched, the 
characters will find the dead body of an unfor 
tunate victim. The body will be only a skele 
ton. The individual was carrying a sack of 
mixed coins (10 gp. 8sp; and 9 cp) plus a jade 
ring with dragons carved into it worth 250 gp. 

31. ICE CAVE 


As you walk down the stain you notice a 
rapid drop in temperature. The tempera 
ture k nearly freezing at the bottom of the 
stairs. You notice that the walls of the large 
cave at the foot of the stain arc covered 
with a thin layer of ice. Hanging from 
hooks in the ceiling arc slabs of meat. 


Thk room k an ice cavern, a natural under 
ground cave which stays cold all year round. 
Except for mean and other foods stored here, 
the room k empty. 

32. ROWENA'S ROOM 


Upon entering this rectangular room, the 
first thing you notice is a tapestry hanging 
on the wall; they show scenes from the life 
a female minstrel. In front of each tapestry 


52 










THE SILVER PRINCESS 


is a couch. Pillows of various sues are scat 
tered on the couches. Empty wine goblets 
and wine bottles are piled into one comer 
of the room. Decorative candle holders 
filled with candle stubs sit on small tables 
near each couch. In the center of the room 
is a decorative wheel painted on the floor. 
The wheel is 5' in diameter. In the middle 
of the wheel is a small lap harp made of 
crystal with strings of spun silver. 


The crystal harp is known as the Ice Harp. It 
belongs to the minstrcal Rowena. Rowena is 
one of the legends of Haven. Her music was so 
melodic that she was invited to live with the 
Protector. Time does not flow the same there 
as in the rest of the world. Though Rowena 
has lived there for many yean, she is still a 
young woman. 

If the party plays two notes on the Ice Harp. 
Rowena will appear. She will know about the 
Eye of Arik and will be able to tell the characters 
what happened to cause the disaster to Haven. 
She also knows the proper sequence of notes to 
play on the Ice Harp to shatter the ruby. She will 
show the party which notes to play. 

Rowena cannot remain here for long or her 
real age will catch up with her and she will 
wither away to dust. She will explain what 
needs to be done, then she will return to the 
Protector's realm. If the party attacks her for 
some reason, she will return there immedi 
ately. The proper sequence of notes which 
destroys the ruby is too complicated for the 
party to accidently discover. For the short time 
she is in this world, Rowena is protected 
against all attacks. Thus it makes no differ 
ence what her characteristics or statistics are. 
She will not attack, nor can she be harmed. If 
the party attacks her she will leave because she 
deems the party unworthy of her help. 

The Ice Harp is magical. If the phrase "For 
the memory of Rowena" is chanted, the Ice 
Harp will play some of her most famous tunes. 
Princess Argenta often held parties in this 
room. The guests sat and drank wine while lis 
tening to the Ice Harp. 

33. ZOMBIE CHAMBER 


This room has been partly cut from the sur 
rounding rock. The stone work is cruder 
than is usual for the rest of the palace. On a 
table in the comer of the room is the small 
silver statue of a dragon readying for 
flight. In front of the statue, acting as 
guards, are five humans. Each human 
guard has a gaping wound. The wounds 
look serious enough to kill any person who 
suffered them. 


The five guards are zombies (AC 8; HD 2; hp 
9; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-8; SaveFl; ML 12; AL 
C). Zombies are undead monsters and may be 
"turned" by a cleric. They are not affected by 
sleep or charm spells or any form of mind 
reading. Zombies are slow fighters and always 
strike last in a round (no initiative roll is need 
ed). The zombies are guarding the silver 
dragon statuette and will attack on sight and 
fight to the death if not turned (no morale roll 
necessary). 

The silver dragon statuette is one of three 
identical statuettes. On the base of the statu 
ette is the phrase "Ariksbane, Destroyer of 
Evil." If any two statuettes are brought within 
30' of the Eye of Arik. the dragon Ariksbane 
will be released from his imprisonment and 
appear. The dragon's frost breath can destroy 
the ruby Eye of Arik without harming anyone 
near the ruby (or trapped inside the ruby). 

The silver statuettes are worth 500 gp each. 
If two of them are used to free Ariksbane, the 
statuettes will disappear. Ellis the Strong and 
Ariksbane will give the party 1,000 gp to pay 
for the statuettes that disappear. 

34. CAPTAIN OF THE GUARD'S ROOM 


This room contains a bed, a small oak 
table, a wooden chair, a wooden footlockcr 
and a pile of papers. The table has been 
toppled over, the chair has been smashed 
into pieces, the footlockcr has been broken 
open, the papers are scattered over the 
floor, and the bed covets arc smeared with 
blood stains. 


This room used to be the quarters for the cap 
tain of the guard. Just before the disaster 
struck, the captain was murdered by one of his 
own men. The murderer, Travis, had been 
driven mad when he saw the Eye of Arik. He 
now serves Arik, leading some of Arik's ores. 
The papers scattered on the floor arc weekly 
reports which the guard captain had to fill 
out. 

35. BARRACKS 


You see five double bunk beds in this 
room. At the foot of each bed arc two 
footlockers. On the east wall, near one of 
the beds, a message has been scrawled. 
The letters of the message are too small for 
you to read at this distance. 

The message has been scratched onto the wall 
with the point of a dagger. It reads. ' Beware 
of Travis." Except for the beds and footlockers, 
the room is empty when the party enters. The 
foodockers contain spare guard's uniforms. 


The foodockers show signs of having been 
searched. 

One round after the party enters the room, 
the crazed guard Travis will enter. Travis has 
been driven insane by the sight of the Eye of 
Arik. Travis (AC 3; F 3; hp 16; MV 20'; #AT I; 
D 1-4 (+2) or 1-8 ( + 2); Save F3; ML 12; AL 
C; S17. 113, W9. D12. Cl5. Ch8) will attack 
the party on sight. First he will throw his mag 
ical throwing dagger +2. The dagger is, of 
course, +2 to hit. On the second round of 
combat, Travis will draw his sword and attack. 
He still wears his guard's uniform over plate 
mail (hence his armor class of 3). 

While Travis fights, he will scream at the 
characters, "You'll never get my treasure! 
Thieves! Everywhere I look, thieves are trying 
to steal my treasure You all must die! I'll nev 
er let you steal my treasure!" 

Travis will fight to the death. The only trea 
sure that can be found on him or in the room 
is the magical throwing dagger. The throwing 
dagger +2 is +2 only when thrown. If used in 
melee it is +1. 

36. SPY ROOM 


You see a small room here. The only furni 
ture in the room is a wooden stool. There is 
a small spy hole in the secret door that lets 
someone inside the room see the corridor 
outside. A rope bell pull hangs from a hole 
in the ceiling. 


This is the room where Travis was hiding. The 
room is normally used as a watching post in 
times of invasion. The bell rope runs up 
through the rock to a bell in room 78. When a 
guard pulls the rope, the bell will ring, alert 
ing the court of danger. The room is now emp 
ty. If the party should open the secret door 
before going into room 35, Travis will still be 
in this room and will attack, (for details of the 
encounter sec room 35). 

37. ARMORY 


Inside this room you see ten statues of 
guardsmen standing at attention. On the 
floor is the corpse of a guard captain. 
Along the walls of the room are empty 
racks which look like they might have once 
held weapons. 

This room was the armory. The ten statues are 
guardsmen who were turned into stone by the 
Eye of Arik. The dead guard captain was mur 
dered by Travis (see room 34). The room holds 
no treasure nor monsters. 


53 










THE SILVER PRINCESS 


38. TRAVIS' ROOM 


As soon as you open the door, the character 
who opened the door is attacked by a wild- 
eyed wolf. 


The wolf (AC 7; HD 2+2; hp 11; MV 60'; 
#AT 1; D 1-6; SaveFl; ML 12; ALQused to 
be Travis's pet dog. When Travis was driven 
insane by the Eye of Arik, his dog was turned 
into a wolf. Since the dog was magically trans 
formed into a wolf who serves Arik, the ani 
mal has a Chaotic alignment instead of the 
usual Neutral alignment for wolves. The wolf 
is as insane as Travis. Travis is the only one who 
is safe with the wolf. The wolf will attack the 
party on sight and fight to the death. It has 
heard the party outside the door and was wait 
ing to attack as soon as the door was open. 
This is a special case where the DM need not 
roll for surprise, and even listening at doors 
will not be successful, since the surprise ele 
ment has been determined in advance. It is 
still a good idea for the DM to pretend that he 
or she has checked for surprise and/or listen 
ing at doots by rolling a few dice. If the party 
kills the wolf and looks into the room read 
them the following room description: 


A small bed of fresh straw lies in the north 
western corner of this room. A wooden 
plate, a pair of eating knives, and a bronze 
wine goblet rest on a table in the center of 
the room. Under the table is a wooden 
bowl filled with meat. Several old tapes 
tries have been hung on the walls, and bits 
of fur and other types of floor coverings 
form a makeshift carpet. A lit lantern 
hangs over the table. 


This is the room where Travis and his wolf live. 
Most of the furniture in the room has been 
brought here by Travis. The wooden bowl is 
filled with food for his wolf. On the east wall, 
behind one of the tapestries is a peephole Tra 
vis uses to spy out into the hallway. If the party 
has not yet encountered Travis (sec room 35), 
he will be following them. Travis will attack 
the rear of the party on round 2 of the combat 
with the wolf. For details of an encounter with 
Travis see room 35. 

Travis' treasure is concealed in this room. 
His treasure is hidden beneath the bed, undet 
a loose stone in the floor. The treasure is kept 
in a small wooden case. The treasure consists 
of two sapphires each worth 300 gp, one large 
emerald worth 2,000 gp. and a gold ring with 
the initials "DB" carved on the inside. The 
treasure once belonged to his fellow guards 
men. 


39. TRAVIS' OFFICE 


Directly across the room from the door in 
the north wall is a huge wooden table. 
Behind it is set an ornately carved wooden 
chair. On the table is a candlestick, a feath 
ered quill pen, and several pieces of parch 
ment. 


Travis used to hold court in this room. He 
would review his ore troops here. Since Travis 
had seen his captain fill out reports, he too has 
filled out reports on the condition of his 
troops. But Travis does not know how to write 
his reports, and they are a meaningless jumble 
of scribbles which no one can read (except Tra 
vis). The room is empty of monsters and trea 
sure. 

40. ORC BARRACKS 


This room holds four double bunkbeds. 
Seated on the beds are eight human-like 
creatures who look like a combination of 
animals and men. Despite their weird 
looks, the creatures are all wearing the uni 
forms of palace guards. The uniforms do 
not fit properly. 


The human-like creatures are ores (AC 6; HD 
1; hp 4 each; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-6; Save Fl; 
ML 8; AL C). The ores were led by Travis who 
had them dress up in the uniforms of guards. 

Ores are nocturnal, usually sleeping in the 
day and active in the dark. When fighting in 
full daylight, they must subtract 1 from their 
"to hit" roll. The ores' treasure totals 12 gp. 
38 sp, and 56 cp. 

41. JAIL CELLS 


This area is a group of jail cells. In the aisles 
between the cells you see two large apes 
with white fur. 


The large apes are white apes (AC 6; HD 4; hp 
18 each; MV 40'; #AT 2; D 1-4/1-4; Save F2; 
ML 7; AL N). the white apes will beat their 
chests and growl as the party enters the room. 
If their threats are ignored, they will attack. 

Three of the cells contain statues of men 
dressed in everyday clothing. The rest of the 
cells appear empty. Hidden behind a statue 
inside one of the cells is a small wooden chest. 
The chest holds 1,000 cp. 400 sp, and 200 gp. 
This money is used to pay the guards. Travis 
hid the chest in the cell. 


42. CAVE OF THE STATUES 


A number of life-sized stone statues of 
humans and dwarves have been piled in 
this cave. No attempt has been made to 
store the statues in any order. Some statues 
lean against the walls, others have fallen 
down, and some have been stacked on top 
of other statues. 


The statues piled in this cave are humans who 
were turned to stone when the disaster struck. 
The ores, goblins, and hobgoblins have been 
clearing out the rooms and carrying the statues 
to this cave. If the party takes the time to search 
the cave (5 turns) they will find a chest contain 
ing weapons, beneath a pile of statues. The chest 
holds 4 swords, 2 maces, and a battle axe. One of 
the swords is a sword + 1 . It is indistinguishable 
from the rest of the swords unless a detect magic 
is cast on it. If the party decides to use the 
swords, number the swords 1-4 and let the magic 
sword be number 3. Make sure each character 
who is using a sword (or any other weapon from 
the chest) tells the DM which weapon he or she ab 
using. For example, sword #2 or mace #1. Any 
character using sword #3 will discover it is magi 
cal the first time the sword is used in combat 

43. FUNGUS CAVE 


This room is filled with a number of clay 
pots of different sizes. Plants were once 
planted in the pots but all the plants are 
now dead. Withered stalks, dead leaves, 
and brown dried flowers litter the floor. 
Though ail plant life in the clay pots is 
dead, a vile-looking yellow fungus grows 
on the west walls. 


The yellow fungus is vellow mold (AC can 
always be hit; HD 2; hp 9; MV O'; #AT 1; D 
1-6 + special; Save F2; ML no applicable; AL 
N). Yellow mold can only be killed by fire. A 
torch will cause 1-4 points of damage to it each 
round. Yellow mold will cat through wood 
and leather, but does not harm metal or stone. 
It does not actually attack, but if it is touched. 
the mold will squirt out a 10' x 10' cloud of 
spores. Anyone caught within the cloud must 
save vs. Death Ray or choke to death within 6 
rounds. 

44. CAVE OF THE LOCUSTS 


This huge cave is filled with stalactites and 
stalagmites that glow blue. The stalactites 
and stalagmites in many places have grown 
together to form a single column, growing

THE SHYER PRINCESS 


together so closely, that in some places, 
they almost form a wall from floor to ceil 
ing. It looks difficult, but not impossible, 
to move through the cave. 


This cave is the home of 8 giant locusts (AC 4; 
HD 2; hp 9 each; MV 60'; #AT 1; D special; 
Save F2; ML 5; A1 N). Giant locusts are 3' 
long, giant gray grasshoppers that live under 
ground. They arc herbivorous (plant-eaters) 
and often eat fungus such as yellow mold or 
shriekers. They cannot be harmed by most 
poisons. Giant locusts are stone gray and may 
not be noticed until they move or until the 
party approaches within 20'. They are very 
nervous and will flee most of the time rather 
than fight. They flee by jumping up to 60'. 
Unfortunately, when they panic their only 
thought is to escape. There is a 50% chance 
that they will try to flee by jumping right 
through the party. If they try to jump through 
the party, choose a character at random and 
roll to sec if that character has been hit. If so, 
the character takes 1-4 points of damage from 
being battered. The locust then flies away. 

Giant locusts can also attack and bite for 1-2 
points (but not when they are fleeing). When 
frightened or attacked, giant locusts make a 
loud shrieking noise to warn their fellows. 
This shriek has a 20% chance per round of 
attracting wandering monsters to investigate. 

If cornered, a giant locust will spit a brown 
gooey substance up to 10' at its attackers. To 
hit a character, the locust need only make an 
attack against armor class 9, no matter what 
type of armor the individual is wearing. A 
character hit by giant locust spittle must save 
vs. Poison or tie unable to do anything for 1 
turn due to the awful smell. After this time he 
or she will be used to the smell, but any char 
acter approaching within 5' of the victim must 
also save or be violently ill. This effect will last 
until the spittle is washed off. 

The blue glow of the stalactites and stalag 
mites is caused by a type of moss. The moss is 
harmless. It can be used as a weak light source, 
casting light up to 10'. If the players search the 
cave they will find a small silver statuette of a 
dragon readying for flight. The statuette is in 
a niche along the north wall. The statuette 
looks the same as the one found in room 33 
(for more details see room 33). 

45. CAVE POOL 


A large pool of pitch black water fills the 
room. You sec the glint of gold coming from 
the far side of the pool. A hot wind blows 
through the cave. Moisture fills the air and 


tiny beads of water form on clothing, skin, 
and hair. The floor is damp and slick. 


Once the characters have entered the cave they 
will be able to see the crowned head of a large 
statue of a man. The statue seems to be made 
of bron 2 c. The eyes of the statue are small 
rubies (value 50 gp each). The glint of gold 
comes from a crown on top of the statue's 
head. The crown appears to be made of gold. 
The statue really is bronze, but the crown is 
only gold paint. 

The liquid in the pool is a kind of ink. The 
water of the pool is heated by hot springs. The 
hot water absorbs color from a particular kind of 
mineral lining the pool. The result is a deep pur 
ple ink. Anything that comes in contact with the 
ink will be stained purple Since the ink is per 
manent it will have to wear off naturally (1-6 
days). It will not stain non-porous surfaces which 
do not absorb warer very well (such as steel). The 
ink will not harm charactets. 

Once the charactets reach the statue they 
will find that the rubies can be pried out easi 
ly. If the party carefully examines the statue, 
there is a 50% chance they will discover that 
the head of the statue can be unscrewed. Hid 
den inside the head, packed in a protective 
oilskin bag, is a ring of protection +1. 

46. BLADE TRAP 

At the comer of the corridor is a trap. When a 
character walks over a pressure plate in the 
floor the trap might be sprung. Roll ld6. The 
trap will be sprung on a roll of 1. Roll sepa 
rately for each character that walks around the 
comer. If the trap is sprung, a weighted blade 
(like a guillotine blade) will fall from the ceil 
ing causing 1-10 points of damage to the per 
son who sprung the trap. The blade is hidden 
in the ceiling. 

47. TROGLODYTE ROOM 


In the center of the room you sec three 
human-like reptiles with short tails, long 
legs, and a spiny "comb" on their heads 
and arms. They block the way out. 


The human-like reptiles arc troglodytes (AC 
5; HD 2*; hp 9 each; MV 40'; #AT 3; D 1-4 
each; Save F2; ML 9; AL C). Troglodytes arc 
intelligent. They hate most other creatures 
and will try to kill anyone they meet. Hence 
they will attack on sight. Troglodytes have a 
chamclcon-likc power to blend into their sur 
roundings (normally they surprise on 1-4 on 
ld6), but they are not using the ability at the 
moment. Troglodytes secrete an oil when 
fighting which smells so bad that characters 


will be nauseated unless they save vs. Poison. 
Nauseated charactets have a penalty of - 2 on 
their "to hit" rolls while in melee combat 
with the troglodytes. 

48. WATCH ROOM 


This room is higher than the surrounding 
countryside so that guards could look out 
on the surrounding land when standing 
watch. There are windows in the west and 
south walls. Ybu notice that the red glow 
still surrounds the palace. In the center of 
the room is an iron ladder. The ladder 
leads to a trap door in the ceiling. By the 
south wall you sec a statue that looks like a 
cleric. He looks frightened and had appar 
ently just finished scratching a message 
into the wall. The inscription reads: 

Evil red eye, malefaction! 

Sweet music from strings; 

Priceless Blade of Destruction, 

Salvation rides on dragon's wings! 


The chief palace cleric had divined the evil 
intent of Arik when disaster struck. He hur 
riedly left the inscription - clues as to how to 
destroy the ruby - in the faint hope that it 
might help rescuers. 

This trap door is the only way the party can 
reach the second level of the dungeon. It is 
important that the party reach the second 
level and finish their mission, but it is also 
important that they encounter a number of 
monsters and traps before reaching the second 
level. If they reached the second level too easi 
ly the adventure would not be a challenge. On 
the other hand, since they must reach the sec 
ond level, the DM might consider sending the 
vision of a Protector to the party if they cannot 
find the way to this trap door leading to the 
second level. 

SECOND 

DUNGEON LEVEL 

Wandering Monsters 

The second dungeon level has its own wander 
ing monster table. Check for wandering mon 
sters every other turn. Roll ld6: the party will 
encounter a wandering monster if a 1 is rolled. 
The wandering monster will be first seen 20- 
120 feet (2d6xl0') away from the party when 
encountered. in any direction and doing any 
thing the DM chooses. To determine exactly 
which monster is encountered, use the Wan 
dering Monster Table: Level 2.

It is suggested that the monsters Harpy and 
Medusa be encountered no more than once as 
wandering monsters. If the DM rolls a wan 
dering monster encounter with a second Har 
py or Medusa, a wandering monster from the 
Level One table should be chosen instead. 
Both monsters are very difficult challenges, 
might upset the play balance if encountered 
too many times. 

All the monsters on the second level wan 
dering monster table appear in the D&D(r) 
Basic rules. Only those with unusual powers 
arc described below. 

Ghoul: A successful attack by a ghoul will par 
alyze any creature of ogte-size ot smaller, 
except elves, unless the victim saves vs. Paraly 
sis. Elves are immune to the paralysis, but still 
take normal damage from a ghoul's attacks. 
Paralysis lasts for 2-8 turns. 

Harpy: Any character hearing the harpy's song 
must save vs. Spells or be charmed. Charmed 
individuals will move toward the harpy, resist 
ing any attempt to stop them, but not other 
wise attacking. If a character successfully saves 
the character will not be affected by the harpy 
song for that encounter. Harpies are resistant 
to magic and have a +2 on all their saves. 
Medusa: Looking at a medusa will turn a char 
acter to stone unless the victim saves vs Turn 
to Stone. A medusa can also attack with her 
snaky hair. The bites of the snakes are poison 
ous (save vs. Poison ot die in one turn) and 
when the snakes hit they cause 1-6 points of 
damage. Anyone who tries to attack a medusa 
without looking at it must subtract 4 from 
their "to hit" roll. A medusa is resistant to 
magic and gains + 2 on saves vs. Spells only, 
other saving throws arc normal. 

Key to Dungeon Level Two 

49. WATCH TOWER 


This watch tower has 6 windows overlook 
ing the surrounding lands. There is a trap 
door in the center of the floot. A stone 
statue of a guard stands looking out each 
window. Except for the statues the room 
looks empty. 


The room is empty except for the statues. 

50. PASSAGEWAY 


As soon as you open the door, bright lights 
flood the hallway. You sec three swords 
fighting each other, as if being held by 
invisible men. 


The fighting swords and bright light is an illu 
sion placed there by the palace magic-user to 
frighten intruders who might enter the palace 
through the tower. The illusion is triggered by 
the door opening without the password 
"Argenta" being spoken. If any character 
touches the illusion it will be dispelled. 

51. LABORATORY 


You see a room filled with stuffed animals, 
shelves filled with books and scrolls, and 
jars of powders and herbs. Strange symbols 
are painted on the walls. An iron statue of 
a warrior stands in the southeast comer of 
the room. A polishing cloth is draped over 
the warrior's shield. 


This room was the palace magic-user's labora 
tory. The iron statue is actually a living iron 
statue (AC 2; HD 4; hp 18; MV 10'; #AT 2; D 
1-8/1-8; Save F4; ML 11; AL N). Living iron 
statues have bodies which can absorb iron and 
steel. When hit, they will take normal dam 
age, but if a non-magical metal weapon is 
used, the attacker must save vs. Spells or the 
weapon will become stuck in the body of the 
living iron statue, and can only be removed if 
the statue is killed. 

52. STOREROOM 


This small room appears to be empty. 


The room once held stores of various sorts but 
has recendy been cleaned out. 


53. MIRABIUS' ROOM 


A plain bed and a huge wooden desk dom 
inate this sparsely furnished bedchamber. 
A broom lies in one comer near a pile of 
din. A tattered pair of silk bedroom slip 
pers lie on the floor near the bed. A small 
nightstand has been overturned. While 
you watch, a small black kitten races out 
from under the bed. bats one of the slip 
pers around, then runs back under the 
bed. 


The room is the bedroom of the palace magic- 
user. Mirabilis. The black kitten is his familiar 
and pet. Three times a day the kitten can 
transform itself into a panther (AC 4; HD 4; 
hp 18; MV 70'; #AT 3; D 1-4/14/1-8; Save 
F2; ML 8; AL L). The transformation lasts 10 
rounds. When in kitten form the creature is 
harmless. Note that while panthers are usually 
neutral in alignment, the kitten / panther is 
lawful because this magical animal is the 
familiar of a magic-user. 

If the party carefully searches the desk, 
there is a 50% chance that they will find a 
secret compartment. The secret compartment 
holds a potion of invisibility. 

54. WASHROOM 


A mirror is hung on the cast wall. In front 
of the mirror is a wash stand. On top of the 
wash stand is a porcelain bowl filled with 
water. A statue stands in front of the wash 
stand. The statue is of an old man with 
long hair and beard. The man wean robes 
covered with magical symbols. The statue 
looks like a man trimming his beard with a 
pair of scissors. 


The statue is actually Mirabilis, the palace 
magic-user, who was turned into stone by the 
Eye of Arik. Mirabilis was trimming his beard 
at the time. 

55. STUDY 


A statue of a young girl playing with a dove 
is in the southeastern comer of this oddly 
shaped room. A large hand-carved book 
case stands next to the northeastern wall. 
Two wooden benches, one in front of each 
of the the rwo southwestern windows, have 
scrolls lying upon them. Two women stand 
next to one of the benches. Both women 
wear leather armor and carry swords. One 
of the women has just unrolled a scroll and 
is reading it. 


The statue in this room is one of Princess 


56 










THE SILVER PRINCESS 


Argenta's ladies in waiting who was turned to 
stone. None of the scrolls in the room arc 
magical, they are merely blank parchment on 
which court officials sometimes write letters. 

The two women appear to be fighters, but 
are really thieves. They were trying to loot the 
rooms of Mirabilis before the disaster struck. 
Mirabilis caught them and put them to sleep 
with a sleep spell. He was going to clean up 
and then report them to the guards, but disas 
ter struck first. The women thieves were not 
affected by the disaster. They have only 
recendy awakened and arc setting out to loot 
the palace. The two women are named Can- 
dclla (AC 5;T/2; hp 8; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-8; 
Save T2; ML 7; AL N; S12, 115. W13, D17, 
Cl5. Ch 14), and Duchess (AC 5;T/2; hp 11; 
MV 40'; (CAT 1; D 1-8; Save T2; ML 7; AL N; 
Sll, 112, W15, D16. 08, Chl5). Because of 
their wisdom ability scores, both women gain 
a bonus of +1 on magic-based saving throws. 
The two thieves are both very attractive and 
will attempt to use this to their benefit. 

These two thieves will act friendly toward 
the party. They will pretend to be young inex 
perienced fighters in search of adventure. 
They will politely ask to join the party, saying 
that they are not quite as tough or as prepared 
for adventuring as they had originally 
thought. 

If they join the party the two thieves will wait 
for a good chance to steal whatever they can 
(cither by trying to pick pockets or just grabbing 
any loot in sight), and then tun away. 

If the thieves are not allowed to join the 
party, but arc not attacked, they will try to get 
close enough to a character to try to pick that 
person's pockets. If discovered, they will claim 
that the person made a mistake, that they 
merely bumped into the person by accident. 
If successful they will leave with their loot. 

The thieves will each have the following: a 
backpack. 50' rope, 12 iron spikes, mirror, 
wineskin, rations, 4 small sacks, 21 cp. 7 sp. 
15 gp, wolfsbane (Duchess only), and a suing 
of pearls worth 600 gp (Candclla only). 

When playing the roles of NPCs the DM 
should keep in mind that NPCs arc reasonably 
normal persons. They seldom act suicidally. 
usually fighting only if there is a chance to 
win. While they will take risks, they will sel 
dom take unreasonable risks. In this particular 
encounter, the two thieves want loot. They arc 
likely to try whatever method offers the best 
possibilities for gaining the most loot at the 
least risk. 

56. MAGIC USER'S BEDROOM 


In this room is a large canopy bed with 
heavy dark ted curtains, all closed. Three 


matching rugs lie side by side on the floor. 
The room also contains a long wooden 
dresser, a matching chest of drawers, and a 
large stuffed easy chair. 


If the party opens the curtains to the bed they 
will see an old man lying in the bed. The old 
man has a long white beard and hair. He is 
wearing robes embroidered with magical sym 
bols. If the party asks, let them know that the 
man looks exactly like the statue in room 54. 
Even the clothing is similar. 

The creature on the bed is not really a man, 
it isadoppleganger(AC 5; HD 4*; hp 18; MV 
30'; #AT 1; D 1-12; Save FlO; ML 10; AL C). 
Dopplegangers are man-sized, shape 
changing creatures that are intelligent and 
evil. A doppleganger is able to shape itself 
into the exact form of any human-like crea 
ture (up to 7' tall) it secs. The creature is imi 
tating the statue of Mirabilis. While the 
doppleganger can speak, it cannot cast spells 
(as Mirabilis could, if he were not stone). The 
doppleganger will try to join the party. Then, 
when it gets a chance and no one is watching, 
it will single out a victim. Just before it 
attacks, the doppleganger will turn into a 
duplicate of the victim. The doppleganger 
will try to secretly kill its victim so that it can 
take the victim's place. 

If Duchess and Candclla are with the party, 
the doppleganger may choose one of them as a 
victim or one of the party members. Of 
course, if the doppleganger succeeds in killing 
its victim, and hides the corpse, it will pretend 
to be the new character Sooner or later some 
one should notice that Mirabilis has disap 
peared. The doppleganger will continue to 
kill characters secretly until caught. 

Sleep and charm spells do not affect dop- 
plcgangcrs. When killed, a doppleganger will 
turn back to its original form, that of a 
human-like creature with blank features. 

57. ALCOVE 


This small alcove contains two large cush 
ioned chairs. A small book lies on the floor 
between them. 


The small book is a book of prayers. Someone 
has slashed the pages with a knife. The prayer 
book was slashed apart by the bugbears in room 

59. 

58. SANCTUARY 


This large room looks like a temple where 
the patron Immortal of Haven is wor 
shipped. A statue wearing clerical robes 


stands in front of an altar. More statues of 
people of many different ages, all dressed 
in normal clothing, sit on the wooden 
pews. Someone has splashed red paint over 
the altar and all the statues. 


This room is the palace chapel. A service was 
being held at the time when the disaster 
struck. The cleric Branaur and the people 
attending the service were ail turned into 
stone. The bugbears in room 59 have splashed 
red paint on the statues. If they check, the 
party will discover that the paint is still fresh. 

59. CHAPEL 


This room is filled with symbols holy to the 
gods of Haven. Three large, human-like 
individuals are splashing red paint on the 
holy symbols using large buckets of paint. 
The three creatures are extremely hairy and 
ugly-Iooking. 


If the party has encountered goblins or hob 
goblins, they will recognize a family resem 
blance between goblins, hobgoblins and the 
three bugbears (AC 5; HD 3 + 1; hp 14 each; 
MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-6 + 1; Save F3; ML 9; AL 
C). Bugbears arc giant hairy goblins. Because 
of their strength, they add +1 to all damage 
rolls with weapons (but not on their "to hit" 
rolls). 

60. SECRET CLOSET 


You see a number of clerical robes and 
fighting gear hanging in this closet. 


Branaur keeps his spare robes and fighting 
equipment in this secret closet. His armor is 
plate mail +1 and his mace is a mace +1. 

61. GAME ROOM 


A game table has been set up in the middle 
of the room. A chess set sits upon it. with a 
game apparently in progress. Two statues 
sit on cither side of the chess board. One 
statue is of a man, the other is of a woman. 
On the north wall of the room is a mosaic 
map of Haven. The area on the map which 
represents the palace glows with a ted 
light. The red light seems to be slowly 
expanding outward, covering more of 
Haven as you watch. 


The wall map magically depicts the spreading 
influence of the Eye of Arik. It indicates that if 
the player characters do not succeed in their 
mission, Haven is doomed.

THE SHYER PRINCESS 


62. BALLROOM 


This large ballroom is decorated in silver, 
red and blue. The two huge fireplaces are 
stacked with logs. A bell-shaped wire 
framework hangs from the ceiling, sup 
ported by four white marble columns. The 
framework is decorated with intertwined 
leaves and flowers. You hear the strains of 
eerie music. Two pale, shadowy appari 
tions are dancing to the sounds of the 
strange music. The two figures are dressed 
in clothing that was popular more than 
three hundred years ago. 


The ballroom had already been decorated for 
the grand dance to celebrate the finding of the 
ruby when the disaster struck Haven. The two 
ghostly dancers have haunted the ballroom 
since their tragic deaths nearly 300 years ago. 
The ghostly dancers were lovers who died on 
the eve of their marriage just before a grand 
ball to celebrate their marriage. Ever since 
then, they have haunted the ballroom at 
times right before a grand ball. They leave 
when the dance begins, but since the celebra 
tion has been postponed indefinitely, they 
continue to haunt the room. 

Characters who look at the ghostly dancers 
must make a saving throw vs. Spells or run 
from the room in fright. Anyone who fails to 
save will run into room 63 (the garden), the 
ghostly dancers have no actual physical 
bodies. They cannot attack, nor can they be 
hurt by weapons or magic. If attacked, they 
will continue to dance on, completely ignor 
ing the party. 

63. PALACE GARDEN 


This area is the palace garden. The garden 
is roofless and is lit from above by a blood 
red light. The garden has become com 
pletely overgrown with weeds. Except for a 
large stand of white rose bushes in the cen 
ter of the garden, all the flowers that once 
grew here have died. One type of weed 
seems most common in the garden. The 
weed is a large bush. It has a dwarf-sized 
central trunk covered with sickly-looking 
green leaves. Growing out of the central 
mound-like trunk is a tangle of many 
thorny branches. You sec about a dozen of 
these plants. Beneath the weeds you can 
just barely sec a cobblestone path that 
wanders through the garden. 


Where Arik rules, normal plants do not grow. 
The normal flowers in the garden have all 
died. In their place now grow weeds and two 
monstrous types of plants. 


The garden introduces two new monsters: 
archer bushes and vampire roses. The bushes 
with the sickly green trunks and thorny brown 
branches are archer bushes (AC 7; HD 2; hp 9 
each; MV 1'; #AT 1; D 1-4; Save Fl; ML 12; 
AL C). Archer bushes arc carnivorous and can 
move slowly to reach dead prey. Hidden in the 
trunk, beneath the leaves, is a large mouth. 
The mouth holds extra hard thorns which the 
archer bush uses like teeth to devour ptcy once 
the ptcy is killed. Archer bushes attack by 
shooting a spray of thorns at their victims. The 
thorn spray is composed of several small 
thorns which become embedded in the vic 
tim's flesh on a successful "to hit" roll. The 
thorn spray causes 1-4 points of damage, and 
can only be directed at one target at a time. 
Archer bushes can shoot their thorn spray up 
to 20 feet away. Each bush can only fire three 
such sprays in a day. 

The white rose bush at the center of the gar 
den is a vampire rose bush. Vampire roses (AC 
7; HD 4; hp 18; MV 10'; #AT 1 + blood 
drain; D 1-8; Save F2; ML 12; AL C) look like 
normal white rose bushes. Like the archer 
bushes, however, they can uproot themselves 
to move about slowly. Each 4 hit dice worth of 
vampire roses represents a single rose bush. 
There is only one vampire rose bush in this 
garden. The 10' long thorny stalks of a vam 
pire rose can whip around a victim, inflicting 
1-8 points of damage on a successful hit. Once 
the thorn stalk has struck and wrapped around 
a victim, the vampire rose will inflict 1-8 
points of damage (blood-drain) each round 
automatically. The vampire rose also injects a 
hypnocic anesthetic into the victim's blood 
stream. The victim must save vs. Spells or lose 
all willpower, allowing the vampire rose to 
continue sucking blood until the victim dies. 
If the victim saves successfully, any character 
with normal strength can break free and try to 
run away. After a vampire rose has completely 
drained a victim, the roses will be colored 
blood red instead of white for 1 day. 

The archer bushes and the vampire bush 
work together. The vampire rose needs a vic 
tim's blood and the archer bushes need the 
victim's flesh. On a pedestal 5' away from the 
vampire rose bush is a silver statuette of a 
dragon about to fly The statuette is similar to 
the ones in rooms (33 & 43). The silver statu 
ettes can be used to return the dragon Ariks- 
banc to Haven. Ariksbane can destroy the Eye 
of Arik (sec room 30 for details). 

64. SILENT ALARM 

Corridor: As the party steps under this arch 
way. they will step on a hidden pressure plate 
that rings an alarm bell in room 65. warning 
the monster there of the party's presence. 


65. GREAT HALL 


This large dining hall is panelled with 
rough wood. Wooden bracing beams run 
from floor to ceiling along all four walls. 
Crossbeams run from the bracing beams, 
supporting the wooden ceiling. A large 
fireplace is set in the north wall. A long U- 
shaped wooden table dominates the center 
of the room. Stuffed animal heads, obvi 
ously hunting trophies, hang on the walls. 


This dining room was used for grand feasts. 
The wooden beams were intended to give it a 
"rugged" look. Hanging from the ceiling 
beams, waiting for the party, is a new monster, 
a decapus (which was warned of the party's 
approach when they stepped on the pressure 
plate in area 64). 

The dccapus (AC 5; HD 4; hp 18; MV 1' or 
30'; #AT 9: D 1-6 or 1-3 each; Save F2; ML 9; 
AL C) is a creature usually found in forests. It 
looks like a bloated, hairy globe with ten ten 
tacles. Its hail is brown, and its body is green. 
In the center of the decapus's 4' wide body is a 
huge, toothy mouth. 

Decapuses usually live alone, preferring to 
hunt by themselves. They hunt by swinging 
through trees and scooping up their prey in 
their tentacles. The tentacles are 10' long. 
They extend from all parts of ic body. The 
tentacles are covered with suckers which the 
decapus can use not only to grasp prey, but to 
climb walk and ceilings. 

The decapus attacks with nine of its tenta 
cles, using the tenth tentacle to hang from the 
ceiling (or trees). When the floor or ground, 
the decapus is much more helpless. Its tenta 
cles are not strong enough to support its 
weight upright for long periods of time. On 
the ground, the decapus can only manage six 
attacks, and these attacks do only half normal 
damage. When swinging through trees, the 
decapus can travel at 90' per turn, or 30' per 
round. On the ground the decapus can only 
move 3' per turn or 1' per round. 

If the party searches the room they will find 
on the mantle a book, which the ores who 
serve Arik took from the library and brought 
to the decapus to guard. The book details 
what happens when Arik tries to break into 
another dimension. The party will recognize 
the description as similar to what has befallen 
Haven. The book also details methods of 
destroying an Eye of Arik, including those 
methods given in the introduction. If the par 
ty is not already aware what their true mission 
is and how the mission can be accomplished, 
the DM should take this opportunity to 
inform them.

THE SILVER PRINCESS 


66. WASHROOM 


This room contains a counter along the 
east wall. Beneath the counter top is a pair 
of sliding cabinet doors. The room other 
wise appears to be empty. 


This is a room where hunters clean up after the 
hunt. Beneath the counter are shelves filled 
with basins for bolding water, bars of soap, 
and clean towels. The room is empty of mon 
sters or treasure. 

67. LOUNGE 


This room holds piles of broken furniture. 
Standing among the remains of the furni 
ture is a huge fearsome, human-like crea 
ture about 9' tall. The creature is wearing 
skins for clothing. 


The human-like creature is an ogre (AC 5; HD 
4 +1; hp 19; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-10; Save F4; 
ML 10; AL C). The ogre is on a rampage and 
has just destroyed the furniture here for the 
fun of it. The ogre is carrying a leather sack 
with 300 gp in it. 

68. SUMMONING ROOM 


When you open the door you see a man 
chanting in some unknown language. The 
man is standing inside a blood red circle. 
Strange symbols have been painted around 
the circle. The man has long black hair and 
wean red robes. Hanging from his belt is a 
mace. A red eye has been painted in the 
center of his forehead. Inside the circle, in 
front of the man, is a strange-looking 
sword. The sword, which appears to be 
made of ruby, rests on a plush black velvet 
cushion. As the man continues to chant, 
the sword begins to pulse with a crimson 
light. 


The man inside the circle is Catharandamus, a 
cleric who worships Arik (AC 2; C3; hp 15; 
MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-6 + 2 or by spell; ML 7; 
AL C; S16. 112, W17, D12, CIO, Chl4). 
Right now, he is in the middle of a ceremony 
that will permit Arik to teleport from his 
prison dimension to Haven. The focal point of 
the ceremony is the ruby sword, which is the 
Sword of Arik. This sword will act as a gate 
through which Arik will enter Haven if the 
ceremony is successful. As soon as Catharan 
damus sees the party he will yell "Help!" A 
voice from behind the left inner door (to room 
69) will answer "Hang on, we're coming." 
Two rounds later the 7 ores and the werewolf 
from room 69 will burst into the room. 


Catharandamus has two spells: darknr" 
and cause fear. Darkness is the reverse of the 
spell light. It will block all sight except infra 
vision within a circle of darkness 30' in diame 
ter. It will cancel a light spell if cast against it 
and vice versa. If cast at an opponent's eyes, it 
will cause blindness until cancelled, or until 
the spell duration is reached (12 turns ).-Cause 
fear is the reverse of the spell remove fear. It 
will make any one creature flee for 2 turns 
unless a successful save vs. Spells is made. The 
spell has a range of 120'. 

Beneath his robes. Catharandamus wean a 
suit of plate mail armor. He carries and will 
fight with his magical mace + 2. 

69. BEDROOM 


This room contains a bed, a large wooden 
chest, a stool, and a wooden wardrobe. 


The bedclothes arc crumpled, as if a number 
of people had been sitting on the bed. The 
chest is filled with old nightshirts packed in 
mothballs. The wardrobe is empty. Normally 
this room is a guest bedroom. Recently, the 
room has been occupied by the bodyguard of 
Catharandamus. the cleric in room 68. The 
bodyguard is 7 large ores (AC 6; HD 1; hp 6 
each; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-6; Save FI; ML 8; 
AL C). The ores all carry shields with a red eye 
painted on them. The leader of the ores is 
Alha, a werewolf (lycanthropc). When first 
encountered, she will be in human form, but 
she will change into a werewolf to attack if she 
can. Alha (AC 5 (9 in human form); HD 4*; 
hp 18; MV 60'; #AT 1; D 2-8; Save F4; ML 8; 
AL C) will also be wearing a red robe and has 
an eye painted on her forehead. 

If Catharandamus yells for help (from room 
68), Alha and the ores will yell back that they 
are on their way and rush to his aid. Alha will 
turn into a werewolf and attack. Any human 
character who is severely hurt by her (losing 
more than half of his or her hit points) will 
become a lycanthropc of the same type in 2-24 
days. The victim will begin to show signs of 
the disease (such as an appetite for raw meat) 
after only half that time. The disease will kill 
non-humans instead of turning them into 
werc-creatures. However, if the Eye of Arik is 
destroyed as a result of the party's actions, any 
character with the disease of lycanthropy will 
automatically be cured. 

70. TREASURE ROOM 


This room appears to be bare except for a 
table and four chain. A wooden chest sits 
on top of the table. 


The wooden chest is a treasure chest. It is 
trapped with a poison dan trap. A close 
inspection of the chest will show that the lock 
is in the form of a screaming face. The two 
eyes of the face can be pushed in. If both eyes 
arc pushed in at the same time, the chest will 
be safe to open. If not, a poison needle will 
shoot out of the mouth when opened. Any 
one opening the chest without precautions 
will be hit by the needle and must save vs. Poi 
son or die within 2 rounds. Inside the chest are 
650 gp. 1,000 sp, and a pouch holding 10 fire 
agates (a type of gem stone) each worth 50 gp. 
The treasure belongs to Catharandamus and 
his bodyguard. 

71. SITTING ROOM 


Several chairs and tables form a semi-circle 
in front of the fireplace in this room. A 
worn mg lies rolled up in one comer. A 
knitting basket sits next to the mg. On a 
small table near the fireplace is a small tea 
cup on a saucer and a tea pot. Hanging 
over the fireplace is a portrait of Princess 
Argenta. She is holding a beautiful blood 
red mby the size of an apple. 


The tea cup is magical. If any character touch 
es the tea cup it will speak, reciting a riddle- 
type poem which gives the part)' hints on how 
to stop the disaster that has befallen Haven. 
The riddle is; 

Three crystal notes; 

Two Silver drakes; 

One mby sword; 

All will smash the Demon's Eye, 

And lift the curse from Haven. 

The riddle refen to the Ice Harp (room 32), 
the silver statuettes of the dragon Auks banc 
(rooms 33,43. and 63). and the Sword of Arik 
(room 68). 

72. BATHING ROOM 


The walls of this bathing room arc painted 
with peaceful scenes of spring and sum 
mer. An ornate marble and silver bathtub 
sits against the eastern wall. A silver enam 
elled towel rack standing next to the tub 
holds a towel and wash cloth. A soap con 
tainer of carved ivory sits on a stand next to 
the tub. At the head of the tub is a deli 
cately sculpted tray. Sitting on the tray are 
three small gems. One gem is red. one is 
blue, the other is yellow. 


This particular bath tub is magical. If the red 
stone is placed in the mb. the mb will fill with 


59 









THE SILVER PRINCESS 


hot water. If the yellow stone is placed in the 
tub, the tub will fill with cold water. If both 
stones ate placed in the tub at the same time, the 
tub will fill with warm water. If the blue stone is 
placed in a tub full of water, the water will disap 
pear. These gems are only worth 100 gp each, 
and they will only work in this bath tub. 

73. ARGENTA'S BEDROOM 


A large ornate canopy bed sits in the mid 
dle of the room. The bed posts have been 
carved to resemble twining vines. The bed 
is covered with dull red velvet. Tapestries 
line three walls. They show typical scenes 
of life in Haven before the disaster struck. 
To either side of the double door is a hand- 
carved wooden chest of drawers. Both chest 
of drawers have mirrors on top of them. A 
small cushioned chair and matching foot 
stool are at the end of the bed. 


This was Princess Argenta's room. It is cur 
rently empty. 

74. GUARD ROOM 


The room contains a wooden table and sev 
eral wooden chairs. Standing next to the 
fireplace is a man dressed in the uniform of 
the palace guard. The man's body has 
more than a dozen stab wounds, which 
would normally kill an individual. 


The man in the guard uniform is a corpse. Liv 
ing in the corpse is a particular kind of undead 
spirit known as a wight (AC 5; HD 3*; hp 13; 
MV 30'; #AT 1; D Energy drain; Save F3; AL 
12; AL C). Wights can only be hit by silvered 
or magical weapons, or turned by a cleric. On 
a successful hit from a wight, it will drain life 
energy. Each hit drains one level of experience 
or hit die and any abilities gained for that level 
arc lost. For example, a 3rd level fighter struck 
by a wight becomes a 2nd level fighter, keep 
ing only enough experience points to be at the 


midpoint of 2nd level, and losing one hit die 
of hit points. Any person totally drained of 
life energy by a wight will become a wight in 
1-4 days, and will be under the control of the 
wight who drained him or her. 

Hidden behind a loose stone in the north 
wall is the wight's treasure: 2,000 gp and a 
crystal ball. 

75. ALE ROOM 


On a stand in the southeast comet of the 
room sits a cask that has been upped with 
a spout. A cabinet next to the cask holds 
dozens of glasses. The room also contains a 
half-dozen wooden chairs. 


This room is an ale room. It is empty of mon 
sters or treasure at present. 

76. THRONE ROOM 


An ornate throne of silver and oak sits atop 
a dais along the center of the north wall. 
On either side of the dais is a tapestry 
showing the changing seasons in Haven. 
Spring and Summer arc shown on the tap 
estry to the left of the throne. Fall and 
Winter arc shown on the tapestry to the 
right of the throne. The room is filled with 
statues of men, women and dwarves. The 
statues are arranged to resemble a typical 
court scene (one sutue kneels in front of 
the throne, sutucs of guards flank the 
throne, a sutue of a councilor is leaning 
over, as if whispering to a person on the 
throne, etc.) Resting in the middle of the 
throne is a glowing ruby the size of a large 
man's fist. 


This is Princess Argenta's court room, the 
heart of the palace. The statues are people 
who were turned to stone when the Eye of 
Arik took control. If the party looks closely at 
the ruby, they will notice what appears to be 
two people trapped inside. One is Princess 


Argenu, the other is Ellis the Strong. Knight 
of the White Drakes. 

As soon as the first character touches the 
ruby, red vapors will billow up from it and sur 
round the dais, momentarily obscuring 
vision. When the smoke dean, several fight 
ers in glowing red plate mail with red swords 
and shields will be standing there guarding 
the dais. The number of guards will always be 
exactly equal to the number of party members 
present when the encounter begins. 

The glowing guards arc illusions, similar to 
the fighter in room 15. However, they will not 
go away for 10 rounds or when they are actu 
ally touched by a hand (not hit in combat). 
They attack as 3 hit dice monsters (inflicting 
1-10 points per hit), and no attacks from the 
party will hit or harm them. As soon as one 
illusion is touched with a hand, they will all 
disappear and the "dead'' and "wounded" 
characters will realize that the damage they 
took in this battle was imaginary. 

This is the key room in the party's quest. Their 
mission is to smash the ruby, thus freeing Haven 
from the disaster that has ovenaken the valley. 
The ruby can only be destroyed in three ways: (1) 
Three particular notes played on the Ice Harp 
will shatter the ruby; (2) If the party brings two 
(or more) statuettes of the silver dragon into the 
room, the dragon Ariksbane will be freed and 
the dragon's breath will disintegrate the ruby 
(without harming anything else in the room); 
(3) If some character touches the ruby Sword of 
Arik to the ruby Eye of Arik, both will crumble 
into worthless powder. 

As soon as the ruby Eye of Arik is destroyed, 
the disaster that has befallen Haven will not 
only end. it will begin to reverse. Sick cattle 
will recover, withered crops will grow green 
again. The ora, goblins, hobgoblins and oth 
er evil creatures chat invaded Haven at the call 
of the ruby will flee. The forces besieging the 
Protector will be scattered. Those people turn 
ed to stone will become flesh. Only those indi 
viduals unfortunate enough to die as a result 
of the disaster will not be restored to life. Oth 
erwise, Haven will return to normal

INTERLVDCF 


THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


The characters can stay in Haven until they arc 
completely rested. The Princess Argenta and 
Ellis will be wed, and the characters will be 
honored guests. At the conclusion of the cele 
bration, Thcndara appears. Everyone is suit 
ably impressed-there were a growing 
number of people in Haven who were begin 
ning to doubt her existence. The princess will 
ask Thcndara if the characters can stay. The 
Immortal will smile, shake her head no, and 
say that the characters have more adventures 
ahead of them. 

When the characters are ready, Thcndara will 
transport them to the bank of a rivet. With a 
wave of her hand, she creates a boat large 
enough to hold all of them, and fully provi 
sioned for a journey of some days. Thcndara tells 
them that the way back to civilization lies down 
stream. She also gives them a sealed scroll, and 
instructs them to open it only when Karamcikos 
has become too small for them 

The scroll is the title to a ship that will be 
waiting for them in Specularum (to be used 
for adventure XI, the Isle of Dread). If the 
scroll should be lost, stolen or destroyed 
before it is used, it will reappear within 24 
hours. If it is given away or sold, it will disap 
pear forever. 

Since the characters don't know where they 
are, sailing downstream is their only option. 
Shortly after they set out. it begins to rain. 
The rain continues for several days, and the 
nights arc cold and wild. Worse, the food 
starts to spoil. Just as everyone is starting to 
feel pretty miserable, a small settlement and 
fort comes into view on the cast side of the riv 
er. On the west bank is a towering, fog- 
shrouded hill of rock that rises over 400 feet 
into the air. 

If the party tries to land at the settlement, 
they will run aground and damage their boat. 
It will require at least a week to repair. In the 
meantime, they can go to the Lion's Den Inn, 
the only inn in town. There, they will begin 
the adventure of the Hobgoblin King. 

If the party decides to continue on their way 
to Specularum. the food will go bad (and 
must be purified daily), the weather will stay 
bad, and all must make a successful Constitu 
tion check or become ill (lose half of total hit 
points. -1 on all rolls for a week). The hit 
points must be recovered by bed rest, which 
will be possible once the characters reach the 
Barony of Kelvin. While they are recuperat 
ing. word comes that a small settlement some 
distance upriver named Guido's Fort has been 
overrun by hobgoblins and destroyed. (It will 
be a campaign year before the site is reset 
tled.) The rest of the journey to Specularum is 
uneventful-

General Notes: This adventure was originally 
published as B5. Horror on the Hill. Its action 
is fairly continuous once the players descend 
past the first level, which can be dangerous for 
very low level characters. The adventure in the 
Hill itself is presented here; nineteen minor 
encounter areas on the slopes of the Hill have 
been excluded. 

Maps .142-145 


Beginning the Adventure 

Characters begin their adventure at Guido's 
Fon, at the Lion's Den Inn. The inn has a 
large common room filled with many benches 
and tables, a bar, and a large fireplace. The 
common room is a smoky, dimly-lit place, and 
tends to be rather quiet. The inn also has 
sleeping quaners for rent. One sp per person 
buys a night's lodging on a straw pallet in the 
back room. The quaners arc so dirty that char 
acters who sleep here have a 75% chance of 
becoming flea-infested during the night! 
(Fleas won't affect a character's play; they're 
just a temporary nuisance.) 

At any given time of day or night, 2-12 
(2d6) persons can be found in the Lion's Den. 
Player characters can learn two of the rumors 
on the table below from any of these patrons 
or the innkeeper. For your own information 
only, the table shows whether the rumors are 
true or false. To see which two rumors the 
characters learn, roll 2d8, repeating if neces 
sary until the second roll is different from the 
first. Note that the players must state that 
they can begin to hear the rumors. 

If the characters express an interest in learn 
ing more about The Hill, they are referred to 
the "Old Timer." For each cold beer the party 
buys him, he will divulge another rumor, 
until they have heard all eight. Note that the 
Old Timer goes through the rumors randomly 
(roll a ld8), and although he will not repeat a 
single rumor twice, he will probably repeat 
the two rumors that the party has heard else 
where.

Purchasing Equipment 

The trading post in Guido's Fort is well-stocked, 
and the characters may want to purchase some 
supplies there before embarking. Because the 
outpost is isolated, however, prices are a little 
higher than usual; and thete is no guarantee the 
players can find what they need. 

To determine the availability of any item on 
the Equipment List in the Basic rule book, roll 
ld4 Any result other than a one means that a 
character can find the item. Then toll a ld6 if 
a character wishes to purchase that item. A 
result of one or two means that the price is the 
same as that listed in the Basic rule book; a 
three or four means that the price is 150% of 
the listed amount; and a five or six means that 
it costs twice as much. Note you follow this 
procedure for each item purchased; even 
though one player found a shortsword. for 
example, there k no assurance the next player 
can find one also. 

Getting to the Hill and Back 

Characters can cross the River Shrill to begin 
their adventure on The Hill by seeking out 
one of the fishermen in Guido's Fort. Since 
times are hard for the fishermen, any of them 
are willing to ferry the party across the river. 
Since The Hill k so dangerous, though, the 
cost of the ferry k high: 20 gp. 

The party might also try to rent a boat from 
a fisherman, but without success. A fisherman 
might agree to sell the party a boat, but no 
fishermen k willing to rent one. Everyone in 
Guido's Fort is convinced the party is 
doomed-and renting a boat to people you'll 
never see again doesn't make any sense! If the 
party decides to buy a boat, the cost k 50-80 
gp (ld4+4 xlO). 


As long as the party k adventuring on the 
surface of The Hill, the party may return to 
Guido's Fort as often as they want or can. If 
they haven't bought their own boat, though, 
they must make arrangements for returning to 
Guido's Fort before they leave. Even if they 
choose to stay on and under The Hill through 
out the adventure, they need return passage 
when the adventure k ended. So in any case, 
without their own boat, the party must plan 
ahead for at least one return passage. 

Perhaps they want to arrange for a fisher 
man to pick them up at a specified time and 
place. Any of the fisherman are willing to do 
so-for another 20 gp-but the party must be 
on time or the fisherman leaves. 

The party might also arrange for a fisher 
man to pick them up when he secs a smoke 
signal the party sends. Once the party builds 
its smoke signal fire, there k only a 20% 
chance per turn someone in Guido's Fort sees 
the signal. The fisherman begins crossing the 
river l-4(ld4)tums after someone notices the 
smoke signal. 

If the party has talked to the Old Timer at 
the inn, they find him waiting for them at the 
waterfront as they arc getting ready to leave. 
Impressed by the party's courage and determi 
nation, he offers them a bottle of clear liquid 
as a parting gift. He telk them a drink of the 
liquid helps to heal wounds, and he cautions 
them to use it sparingly. The bottle contains 
three doses of {ration of healing. 

About Monsters 

Many goblins and hobgoblins arc on and 
under The Hill, organized into a loose army 
under the leadership of a hobgoblin king. 
Thk king lives in the dungeon under The Hill 
but k not extremely powerful or effective. Hk 
troops are numerous but cowardly; and if 
combat with goblins or hobgoblins goes badly 
for the monsters, they try to escape. If the par 
ty prevents such an escape, the monstets sur 
render to save their own lives. 

Note that if the characters return to town 
between sorties on The Hill, certain monsters 
arc not idle in their absence. In particular, 
ogres, hobgoblins, and goblins rcplcnkh their 
garrisons three days after the party deans 
them out. In fact, there k a 33% chance the 
number of ogres, hobgoblins, or goblins k 
actually 50% larger than the number first 
encountered! Wandering monsters do not 
rcplcnkh themselves, however. 

Important! 

Encounters with wandering monsters are 


designed to keep the PCs on their toes. They 
arc not designed to be the ultimate challenge 
or climax of the adventure. If the dice call for 
an encounter that you feel would seriously 
deplete the party strength, you should ignore 
that encounter. 

The Mage 

At the end of the adventure the characters will 
encounter a red dragon that they might subdue. 
Because of thk, and because the latter parts of 
the adventure are dangerous, you might set up 
an encounter with a wandering mage who offers 
aid (or. alternately, the following items: potion 
of invisibiliry, two potions of healing, and a scroll 
with the spells web. detea magic, and magic 
missile ) in exchange for first choice of the booty. 
If attacked, he disappears in a puff of smoke. 
The mage should not aid them more than once.

Key to Areas in the Ruined 
Monastery 

20. GARRISON QUARTERS 

In ages past, thk building quartered a small 
garrison of fighters who protected the monks 
of the monastery. The building has withstood 
the ravages of time fairly well, though its 
insides have been looted repeatedly. In the 
large room, which was the dining room for the 


62 



THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


guards, the long tables and benches have been 
overturned, and shattered pottery lies over 
much of the floor. The small room off the din 
ing room was a kitchen: a few cracked pots and 
an oven arc all that remain. 

Each of the four small rooms off the hallway 
on the eastern wing of the garrison quarters 
has a pair of well-rorted wooden beds, and 
other pieces of rot that might have been tables 
and chain in some forgotten age. 

21. HUGE POOL 


This large, dark green expanse of water is 
rimmed by moldy, well-worn stone, which 
reveals still the pool's artificial origin. 


The water is uncomfortably warm to the 
touch. The pool is fed by the same geothermal 
forces that yield the blasts of steam in and 
around The Hill. The water's depth varies 
from about cwo feet around the rim to six feet 
in the middle. 

Along the east end of the pool is a crumbled 
mass of stone that was at one time a luxurious 
bathhouse. No ceiling stands over these four 
rooms, and the walls have crumbled to only 
three or four feet of height. Large cracks can 
be seen, and many of the stone slabs that had 
been used as the ceiling are supported by 
debris. Lurking in these cracks and crevices arc 
eight giant centipedes, which rush forward to 
attack any creatures passing the east rim of the 
pool.

22. STEAM VENT 


This wide crevasse is apparendy bottom 
less. Greenish mold and fungi grow thickly 
along the lip of the opening. 


As is true of the other vents of The Hill, there 
is a 5 % chance per turn that the vent erupts in 
a column of steam. As usual, one round 
before it erupts, any character standing on the 
rim of the vent can hear a gurgling sound. The 
sound gets louder throughout the round and 
culminates in a column of boiling steam 
shooting into the sky. Any character standing 
on the rim when the geyser erupts takes 1-6 
(ld6) points of damage for each round he is 
engulfed in steam. The blast lasts 2-12 (2d6) 
rounds. 


23. OLD TOMB 


The double doors of this building arc elab 
orately carved with a leering face and gro 
tesque torso. The creature's mouth is 
gaping open to display row upon row of 
hideously pointed fangs. Two long, daw- 
upped arms are carved in relief: they seem 
almost to be reaching out to gather in any 
one standing before the doors. 


This carving depicts an old pagan deity, a fat, 
squatting, vaguely humanoid figure whose 
face is twisted into a hideous leer. The door it 
guards are locked. Once inside, the group secs 
a large room lined with many doors. Occupy 
ing a position opposite the door is a large 
granite statue of the same creature pictured on 
the doors. This statue is carved in much more 
detail, and two gems still glitter from its 
eyesockets. The statue is about 12 feet tall, 
but its promiding belly prevents any character 
wearing metal armor from climbing up the 
statue and removing the gems, each worth 

100 gp. 

As soon as any character touches the statue 
or opens one of the doors on the perimeter of 
the room, 12 guardians of the tomb burst 
from the doors and attack. The guardians are 
12 skeletons, and one comes from each door.

Each of the skeletons is armed with a 
shortsword and carries a shield. 

The doors from which the skeletons emerge 
lead to 12 individual tombs, each a broad slab 
of stone set in the middle of an otherwise bar 
ren room. Behind the slab in room 23C is a 
dagger +2, visible only if a character enters 
the room and circles the slab. 

24. TANGLED GARDEN 


This garden is a tangled and thorny mass of 
brambles-virtually impenetrable by 
humans. Many types of plants have over 
run each other here. 


This garden once grew the many potent ingre 
dients the monks used for brewing foul 
potions, or for ingesting as pan of ghasdy rit 
uals. Since the monastery has been aban 
doned, the garden has grown wild. 

The three spots marked with Xs on the map 
arc entrances to tunnels that goblins have 
carved into the tangle. The tunnel entrances 


have been carefully masked with bushes, but 
they may be detected by rolling for a secret 
door. Behind each pile of brush lurk three 
goblins, waiting to ambush the party as they 
approach the temple door to room #31. The 
ambush is sprung only if the party is obviously 
moving toward the door, or if they begin to 
inspect the garden too closely.

The goblins are armed with shortswords and

25. INITIATES' BARRACKS 

This long room contains the rotted remains of 
many wooden bunks The room once housed 
60 of the monks striving to become worthy of 
the monastic order. 

26. DINING HALL 


This room holds rows of long tables and 
benches, covered by a sickening greenish- 
yellow mold. 


The mold is harmless. 

27. SECOND INITIATES' 
BARRACKS 

This room is in the same condition as room 
#25 The only difference is that it contains the 
remains of only 20 bunks.

28. MONASTERY KITCHEN 


A shattered oven and much broken pottery 
lies about the room In the southeast cor 
ner of the room is a large pile of what 
appears to be garbage. Atop this pile are 
two giant rats, squeaking loudly upon 
hearing the door to the room open. 


In two rounds, eight more rats charge into the 
room through a small hole in the kitchen wall 
that leads to the forest outside the monastery.

THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


The rats have been using the kitchen as a lair, 
storing their pile of apparent garbage here. 
Most of the pile consists of tattered pieces of 
leather, old bones, and many shiny pebbles, 
but characters willing to dig through the filth 
can find a few valuable items: three gems (60 
gp. 40 gp, and 30 gp), 7 gp. 12 sp, 2 pp. and 
an arrow +2. 

29. MONASTIC LIBRARY 


The walk of this chamber are lined with 
debris-laden shelves. In the center of the 
floor is a large pile of garbage. 


The library was a storehouse of books and 
papers-information gathered by the monks 
over many centuries. Now the paper and 
leather has crumbled; even the tables and 
chairs have rotted and decayed. The garbage 
pile was once more than 100 books of ancient 
lore. Apparently, the rats have been using it as 
a bed. No rats are currently in the room, and 
nothing of value is hidden in the pile. 

On a shelf at the end of the room (opposite 
side from the door), however, hidden beneath 
tattered works of literature, is an ivory tube, 
worth 50 gp. The tube can only be discovered 
through dose examination of the shelves. A 
screwed-in cap may be removed easily from 
the tube to reveal a well-preserved piece of 
parchment. Upon removal, any cleric recog 
nizes the parchment as a clerical scroll. It con 
tains the following spelk; 

First Level: cure light wounds (x2); detect 
magic 

Second Level: bless 

30. GARDEN OF THE FOUNTAIN 


No roof blocks the sun's rays from this part of 
the monastery, where the atmosphere is peace 
ful and quiet. Around the perimeter of this 
restful spot, placed in an orderly fashion, are 
nine large birch trees. The ground is covered 
by a thick cushion of grass and flowers In the 
center is a pool at whose south end a fountain 
splashes into a shallow bowl. From a spout in 
the bowl, the water flows back to the long 
pool. The water is cool and crystal-dear. The 
stones lining the sides and bottom of the pool 
ate glistening white, and reflections of the 
birch leaves dance in the shimmering surface. 


This garden was a place of great sacredness to 
the monastery's original inhabitants. As pan 
of his rite of initiation, each monk would be 
allowed to take a drink from the fountain. He 


would then be judged according to the effects 
the water had upon him. The magical proper 
ties of the fountain still exist, and characters 
wishing to drink from it may benefit or suffer 
from its effects. A detect magic spell can iden 
tify a strong aura of enchantment from the 
water in the shallow bowl. The water in the 
pool, however, is quite mundane; even 
though it flows from the fountain, somehow 
its enchantment vanishes before the water 
drops into the pool. 

If a character takes a drink from the foun 
tain, calculate the effects by rolling ld8 and 
comparing the result to Table 4 (see below). 
Each character may gain only one effect from 
the water; any further drinks arc simply thirst 
quenching. 

All effects take place immediately; they arc 
permanent (except #3). Note that if a charac 
ter's constitution or dexterity is changed, 
adjustments may need to be made to hit 
points or armor class. 

If the characters wish to rest in the garden, 
or even spend the night here, they encounter 
no wandering monsters.

31. ANCIENT SANCTUARY 

The door to this huge chamber bean the same 
leering visage that was found on the door of 
the tomb. 


In this room, five giant statues of a long- 
forgotten pagan god support the 20-foot 
high ceiling with their heads. The floor is 
smooth stone and very clean. 


The two secret doors leading out of this cham 
ber may be discovered with the normal rofls. 
Each of them can be opened by a simple push. 

32. EMPTY ROOM 

The door to this chamber is stuck and must be 
smashed open. Smashing the door open yields 
a 20% chance that ogres in room #33 hear the 
disturbance and come to investigate. 


Wooden and leather debris litters this 
chamber; a thick layer of dust covers the 
floor and all the room's contents. 


33. OGRE GUARDROOM 

This room is inhabited by a pair of the ugliest 
and meanest ogres to ever walk The Hill. They 
spend most of their time drinking and gam 
bling, so there is a 50% chance that characters 
who stop to listen can hear their raucous bel 
lows and heated arguments. The door to their 
room is locked, and the key hangs on the belt 
of the largest ogre.

(30'); #AT 1 club; D 1-10; Save F4; ML 10; 

ALC. 

When discovered, the ogres are seated at a 
large table in the middle of the room. (It may 
be, of course, that they heard the parry enter 
room #32 and went to investigate.) Because 
they are concentrating on rolling knuckle 
bones (crude, bone dice) on the table before 
them, add one to their chance of being sur 
prised (i.e., they are surprised if you roll one. 
two, or three on ld6). 

The ogres fight savagely, but if they fail a 
morale check, the surviving ogres surrender. 

Three sturdy wooden beds are placed along 
the north wall of the room; a jumble of old 
bones-some of which look disturbingly 
human-are piled against the south wall, and 
a solid bar holds a door on the west wall firmly 
shut. The large table, three chairs, and an old 
trunk arc the only other objects in the room. 

Scattered about the top of the table, among 
the knucklebones and spilled wineglasses, are 
35 gp. 81 ep, and 124 sp. The trunk is locked; 
the key is on a ring on the largest ogre's belt. 
The keys to rooms #33 and #34 are also on this 
ring. Inside the trunk are five huge jugs of 
wine, a sack holding 400 gp and 1,000 sp, and 
a dirty leather sack that is actually a bag of 
holding.

34. PRISON OF THE 
NEANDERTHALS 

The door to this room is barred on the outside 
and locked. If it is opened, four male Nean 
derthals within are crouching belligerently, as 
if prepared to fight with their bare hands. 
They are quite surprised if any creatures other 
than ogres open the door, and wait to see what 
develops before attacking.

These cavemen have been captured by ogres in 
one of the frequent skirmishes between these 
bands of mortal enemies. The peaceful Nean 
derthals have been trying to settle on The Hill 
for several years, but the ogres' depredations 
during this time have made this difficult. 

Since these four Neanderthals were cap 
tured but a week ago, and since they doubtless 
would not have survived long in the hands of 
ogres, they are grateful to anyone who frees 
them. Although they will not understand the 
PCs' language, they try to communicate that 
they consider the party to be valuable friends 
(assuming the party doesn't attack them, that 
is!). If the party successfully rescues these pris 
oners, all of the Neanderthals on The Hill are 
grateful, offering aid to the party whenever an 
opportunity presents itself. 

35. HOBGOBLIN SUPPIY ROOM 

The door to this room is locked; the hobgob 
lin leader in room #38 carries the key. The lock 
may be picked or the door smashed if the char 
acters wish to gain access. 


This room contains a collection of supplies 
that look sufficient for a small army. Six 
bins, a dozen barrels, two crates, and three 
racks are crammed into the large chamber. 


The bins contain many bushels of dried 
beans, grain, and fruit. The barrels hold the 
same cheap wine that the ogres in room #33 
were drinking. The racks hold an array of 
weapons, including 20 shortswords, 25 
swords, 30 spears. 10 crossbows, and 200 
quarrels. Each of the crates holds two dozen 
suits of leather armor, and 40 shields hang on 
the walls of the room. All of the weapons and 
armor arc of a size that humans could use; 
there is nothing to suggest that it is hobgob 
lins who are collecting and preparing to use 
these supplies. 

In truth, this room is a major collection 


point for the supplies the hobgoblins arc 
gathering for a planned assault on Guido's 
Fort. Since the destruction of this trove would 
be a considerable setback to the attack plans, 
consider awarding the PCs 200 experience 
points if they successfully destroy the contents 
of the room. They can do so by b urnin g the 
supplies, but in this case the hallway outside 
fills with smoke two turns after the fire is lit. 
and cannot be occupied for the next 12 turns. 
Smoke spreads through the entire corridor, 
right up to the doors to rooms #32 and #33, 
but it docs not penetrate into any rooms 
whose doors arc dosed. 

Note that the expenence point bonus is 
appropriate only if the characters take the initia 
tive to destroy the supplies. It's important you 
not give the party any suggesuon to do so. Even a 
question such as; "What arc you going to do 
with this stuff?" might be too suggesuve. 

36. ABANDONED CHAMBER 


Except for a thick layer of dust on the floor, 
this chamber appears totally empty. 

This chamber is empty. 

37. ANCIENT PAGAN ALTAR 

This room is dominated by the image of 
the leering pagan god, carved from a block 
of granite. The gems that occupied its 
eyesodeets have already been plundered. 
Eieforc this statue is a shallow stone pit, 
about 6 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 1 foot 
deep. 


The bloody cult of monks who once inhabited 
the monastery used the pit for human sacrifice. 

38. HOBGOBLIN GARRISON 


Three hobgoblins and two goblins arc 
greedily feasting on a shank of meat at a 
dirty table. Their weapons are dose at 
hand and they leap quickly to defend the 
room. 


This chamber serves as a guardroom and line 
of defense to prevent unwelcome intruders 
from discovering the entrance to the dungeon 
below the monastery. Six hobgoblins and six 
goblins are on duty here, protecting the 
approach to their lair and hideout. Four of the 
hobgoblins and four of the goblins are sleep 
ing when the party discovers this room; the 
sleeping monsters require two rounds to arm 


and prepare for battle.

The room has plain wooden bunks along each 
wall; in the center arc a table and two benches. 
Each of the hobgoblins has a belt pouch contain

belt pouches, but they hold only 2d6 sp apiece. 
The nine point hobgoblin carries the key to the 
supply room (room #35) and the access room 
(room #39) on a ring on his belt. 

39. DUNGEON ACCESS ROOM 

This small room contains only a stone stairway 
leading downward into darkness. Characters 
who have infravision may stand at the top of the 
stairs and look down, but all they sec is that the 
stairway continues for more than 60 feet. The 
stairs lead to the dungeon below the monastery. 


ADVENTURE IN 
DUNGEON LEVEL I 

This level of the dungeon is the stronghold of 
the goblins and hobgoblins preparing an 
army. Although the troops have not been 
assembled yet. there are enough goblins, hob 
goblins, and their large cousins the bugbears 
here to keep the characters on their toes! 

Since these humanoids dominate this level of 
the dungeon, few other monsters are found. 
Check for wandering monsters in the normal 
way; if an encounter is indicated, roll a ld6 and 
compare the result to the table below. 

Any monster encountered automatically 
attacks the party, fighting until either the PCs 
are defeated, all the monsters arc dead, or the 
monsters fail a morale check. In the latter 
case, any surviving creatures flee toward room 
#66 to alert the hobgoblin king.

40. BUGBEARS' SITTING ROOM 


In this dirty, vile-smelling chamber, a smoky 
fire is dying in a large fireplace, and a kettle 
holding some greenish-black stew simmers 
over the coals. Three large wooden benches, 
two chairs, and a table fill the room. On the 
table is a large jug and three wine-stained 
goblets, two of which arc tipped over next to 
a sticky pool of wine. The goblets arc crusted 
with dried wine and din. 


The wine goblets are made of silver, discern 
ible only if a character wipes the surface clean. 
Each goblet is worth 30 gp. 

41. EMPTY CELL 


This room is empty except for a pair of 
wooden bunks. 


At one time, this cell held a pair of dwarves 
that bugbears were fattening for a sinister pur 
pose. The secret door on the side of the room 
is simply a block of stone the dwarves removed 
to tunnel to freedom some years ago. The 
bugbears don't know how the dwarves got 
out. If the bugbears take any of the characters 
prisoner, the bugbears place at least two of the 
characters in this cell. 

42. BUGBEARS' QUARTERS 

The door to this chamber is locked; three bug 
bears reside within. They have just finished a 
tiring shift of bullying goblins, so all three are 
sound asleep. 

If the characters can pick the lock, or smash 
the door on the first try, they automatically 
gain initiative. If they hit the door once with 


out breaking it open, however, the bugbears 
arc armed and waiting for them on the next 
round.

the other two cany swords. 


The room contains six large beds, a table 
on which lie three empty bowls, and an old 
but sturdy chest. On three of the beds lie 
three large, apparently sleeping creatures. 


The key to the chest and the key to this room 
are on a thong around the neck of the 15 hit 
point bugbear. Inside the chest is a suit of 
leather armor: a shortsword; a bow, quiver, 
and 16 anows; a sack containing 120 sp, 30 
ep, and 50 gp; and a backpack containing a 
coil of rope, two flasks of oil. and a set of 
thieves' lock-picking tools. 

43. PRISON CELL 

In this dingy chamber is found one hapless 
thief, captured by the bugbears on the out 
skirts of Guido's Fort three weeks earlier. He 
used to own most of the equipment found in

If the characters release Cullen from his prison, 
he is most grateful, happy to join the party for 
the duration of the adventure. He does not ask 
for a share of the loot, claiming that his freedom 
is reward enough. If, however, he should be left 
alone with a bag of jewels for example, there is 
no guarantee that the bag remains as full as it 
was to begin with . . . 

If the characters are not interested in the 
services of another thief. Cullen doesn't try to 
change their minds. He asks if the party has 
seen any sign of his equipment, and if they 
have he asks to have it returned. He does not 
become hostile, however, feeling his position 
to be too precarious to risk antagonizing his 
rescuers. He simply leaves and tries to make 
his way back to Guido's Fort if he is not 
invited to join the party. 

44. SUBTERRANEAN STREAM 

This natural cavern is blocked by a solid wood 
en door-watertight but unlocked. 


A shallow stream runs through this room, 
falling from a spout in the ceding, running 
through a trench in the cavern floor, and 
rushing out through an opening in the 
floor. The stream is about eight feet wide 
and one foot deep. 


Lurking in the shadows where the stream dis 
appears through the floor are three giant cen 
tipedes. As soon as they catch sight of 
intruders in the room, they rush forward to 
attack. 

Giant Centipedes (3): AC 9; HD 1/2; hp 3.2, 
2; MV 60'(20'); #AT 1; D poison; Save 
NM; ML 7: AL N 

Although the level of the stream is low now, 
stains on the walls indicate that it often fills 
the room to a depth of three or four feet. The 
spout in the ceiling is only one foot in diame 
ter, and the stream disappears through a four- 
foot diameter hole in the floor. The hole in 
the floor drops through 60 feet of a winding, 
narrow shaft, before entering a large cavem 
totally filled with water. 

If any characters are foolish enough to drop 
into this shaft, roll 3d6 to see how much dam 
age they take before they enter the flooded 
chamber. If they are still alive, they certainly 
drown there. 

45. TORTURE CHAMBER 


A torture rack, an iron maiden, and a huge 
pot of bubbling oil all give good indication 
of this room's purpose. Feeding the fire 
beneath the oil are two goblins. 


Goblins (2): AC 6; HD M; hp 4.3; MV 60' 
(20'); #AT 1; D 1-6; Save NM; ML 7; ALC. 

Along the southern wall of the room arc four 
cells, each with a metal door. Each door has a 
barred window, pcrsumably to let prisoners 
watch the "entertainment." Mercifully, all of 
the cells are empty of living creatures, 
although a moldering skeleton lies on the bed 
in the far east cell. A ring bearing a large iron 
key hangs on the wall of the chamber. An 
examination shows that the key opens all four 
cell doors. 

46 . CLERIC'S OFFICE 

The door to this chamber is locked. 


66 








THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


In this room a polished circular table, a 
fur-lined bench, a desk, and a chair give 
the room a civilized look. An elaborate 
candelabra, made out of silver and worth 
50 gp, rests on the table. On the desk is a 
miniature statue of the same god whose 
likeness is found throughout the ruined 
monastery. This statue has been carved 
from pumice (hardened lava). 


The desk has two drawers in it. The top drawer 
opens easily, and contains an inkwell, several 
quill pens, and a dozen blank sheets of parch 
ment. The second drawer is locked and 
trapped with a poisoned needle. Any charac 
ter picking the lock without removing the trap 
is pricked by the needle and must save vs. poi 
son or die. The small amount of poison on the 
needle allows the character a + 3 to his or her 
saving throw, however. 

In the locked drawer is a small pouch con 
taining seven gems worth 200 gp each and a 
rolled up parchment. If examined by a cleric, 
che parchment is recognized as a clerical scroll 
on which is written a cure light wounds spell. 

47. CLERIC'S SITTING ROOM 

The hall door leading to this room is locked, 
although the secret door on the west wall of 
the room pushes open easily. 


The floor of this room is padded by several 
huge bearskins, and four soft chairs sur 
round a low table. On the walls are niches 
for two dozen candles, and a shelf holding 
four crystal goblets and two bottles of 
wine. 


The goblets arc worth 50 gp each, and the 
wine, 80 gp per bottle. Both the goblets and 
the wine bottles arc fragile, however, and 
there is a 20% chance they break each time 
any character carrying them is involved in a 
violent situation (combat or fall, for exam 
ple). 

48. CLERIC'S CHAMBER 

The door to this room is not locked. (Its 
inhabitant-the foul cleric Moray Vaco-feels 
quite secure behind his many secret doors.) 


A table, bed, and several chairs arc visible 
in this room. Seated at the table, a 
hunched and scrawny figure is apparently 
writing on a sheet of parchment. 


Moray Vaco: AC 2; C3; hp 12; # AT 1; D 2-7; 


Save C3; AL C; S 12; I 10: W 16; D 12; C

adjustment). 

Spells: First Level: protection from evil, detect 
magic. 

Moray uses a mace + / in combat. His mace is 
always at his side, and he is always wearing his 
plate mail armor. If discovered in his room, 
Moray fights to the death. 

This human cleric is a degenerate and filthy 
individual of thoroughly chaotic alignment. 
He has stayed so long with the goblins he has 
even begun to resemble them: his skin has 
taken on a gray hue, and he has filed his teeth 
to points. 

Moray Vaco is one of the last survivors of the 
black-hearted cult that founded the monas 
tery centuries ago. Lacking human followers, 
he has gathered a congregation of evil mon 
sters. He provides the monsters "spiritual 
guidance" and "moral leadership," and they 
provide him protection, food, and an occa 
sional prisoner to be sacrificed to Moray's iniq 
uitous deity. 

The parchment on Moray's desk is covered 
with foul chants in an ancient tongue. Hidden 
beneath his bed is a long, locked box contain 
ing 120 sp, 40 cp, 30 gp, an elven cloak, and a 
bottle filled with a potion of invisibility. The 
key to this box, the keys to rooms #46 and 
#47. and the key to the locked desk drawer in 
room #46 arc on a ring on Moray's belt. 

49. METAL FORGING SHOP 


Four huge furnace fires bum along the 
west wall of this large room. The air is sooty 
and smoky. The fires are heating various 
pieces of metal, which are being forged 
into swordblades and spearheads. Working 
in this forge arc eight hobgoblins, one 
bugbear, and a very dirty dwarf, impris 
oned by a ball and a chain attached to his 
ankle.

2- 7; Save D2; ALL; S 13,1 10, W9.D 12. 
C 16, CH 8. 

The bugbear carries a large club, the hobgob 
lins wear shortswords. and the dwarf wears a 
leather apron and carries a larger hammer. 


The bugbear oversees the operation of the 
foundry, cursing and bellowing at the hob 
goblins and dwarf. The hobgoblins are tend 
ing the fires (one per fire) and carrying ingots 
of iron from the pile next to the cast wall. Two 
are next to the pile of ingots, and two are next 
to the northernmost fire. The dwarf is ham 
mering at a swordblade at the southernmost 
fire. The positions of all these creatures arc 
marked on the dungeon map as follows: D = 
dwarf; B = bugbear; and H = hobgoblin. 

When the characters enter this room, the 
bugbear and hobgoblins immediately drop 
what they are doing and attack. The dwarf 
does the same, as soon as he catches sight of 
the parry, but he directs his attacks toward the 
monsters. He throws his hammer at the bug 
bear (for 1-6 (ld6) points of damage) and 
snatches up a second hammer with which to 
beat the nearest hobgoblin (for 2-7 (ld6 +1) 
points of damage-strength bonus). 

The foundry is being used to manufacture 
weapons for the army now being recruited. 
The dwarf has been a prisoner for nearly a 
year, his skill as a smith has kept the hobgob 
lins from killing him. Given the chance, he 
fights savagely for his freedom, and offers to 
join the party on the rest of the adventure if 
they so desire. Assuming that the PCs arc vic 
torious in this battle and that they free the 
dwarf, he takes a shield from one of the dead 
hobgoblins (becoming AC 6), but his ham 
mer remains his weapon of preference. 

In addition to the fireplaces, the forge room 
contains two large piles of iron bars, a pile of 
firewood, a smaller pile of coal, and a rack of 
metalworking tools (tongs, hammers, anvils, 
pry bars). 

50. DWARF'S CELL 

This cell, at the far south side of the forge 
room is where the dwarf has been kept. It con 
tains a simple bed. table, and a chair. 

51. GOBLIN ARENA 


Torches placed on the walls at frequent 
intervals light this chamber. Two massive 
stone columns rise from the arena floor to 
support the roof. The arena floor is 10 feet 
below the level of the hallway. Lying in a 
circle in the center of the arena, and hardly 
recognizable from the upper deck, are four 
bodies. 


If the characters approach for a closer look, 
they see that all of the bodies have been 
pierced by many arrows, but they have not 


67 







THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


been dead for long. As the characters 
approach, two shadowy forms advance from 
behind one of the columns to stand by the 
bodies and growl menacingly at the PCs. They 
are two wolves trained as war dogs. 

Wolves (2): AC 7; HD 2 + 2; hp 12.11; MV 

180' (60'); #AT 1; D 1-6; Save FI; ML 8; 

ALN. 

The dogs were trained by the party of adven 
turers now lying dead upon the arena floor. 
The canines arc very loyal creatures, remain 
ing here to guard their masters. The dogs look 
scrawny and underfed. 

Certainly, the PCs can attack the dogs if 
they want, but the dogs do not attack the 
characters unless one of them actually touches 
one of the dead bodies. If the party advances 
to the corpses, the dogs growl and bristle, but 
slowly back away as long as the characters 
remain calm and do not disturb the bodies. If 
a character speaks to the dogs in a calm voice 
and offers them food, they both eat hungrily. 
From that moment on, they regard the person 
who fed them as their master or mistress, even 
to the point of letting that individual examine 
the bodies of their former masters. 

From weapons, armor, and clothing, exam 
ination reveals the four bodies to have been 
two fighters, a thief, and a magic-uset. Each 
fighter wore plate mail armor and carried 
swords, longbows, and 2dl0 arrows. The thief 
wore leather armor and was armed with a 
shortsword + 1 and a dagger. The magic-user 
was unarmed, though a ring of protection +1 
encircles his little finger. None of them carried 
any monetary treasure. 

The dogs have been trained to obey the fol 
lowing commands: "kill," which causes them 
to attack ferociously, gaining +1 to all dam 
age rolls: "stay," which causes them to remain 
in place for at Id4x6 turns if not counter 
manded; "fetch," which causes them to 
advance and pick up an object, without harm 
ing it; "guard," which causes them to eye a 
creature suspiciously, without harming it 
unless it moves (if it moves, the dogs respond 
in the same was as if told to "kill"); and 
"stop," which negates the "kill" and "fetch" 
commands. The dogs also act on their own ini 
tiative to warn of impending danger. 

52. SUPPLY ROOM 

The door to this room is locked; the hobgob 
lin king in room #66 keeps the key. If charac 
ters succeed in picking the lock or smashing 
the door, they find provisions within to sup 
port a good-sized army for several months. 


Bales and boxes line the entire perimeter 
of this room, except for the space in front 
of the door. 


Moving clockwise around the room, the boxes 
and bales contain: cured leather, four by four 
foot pieces; grain from com. wheat, and oats; 
salt; dried beans: nails; thousands of arrow 
heads; thousands of fresh torches; 20 coils of 
rope, 100 feet to each coil; 200 woolen cloaks; 
800 iron spikes; 200 backpacks; 30 wooden 
poles, each 10 feet long; and 100 small sacks. 

This trove is obviously valuable to the hob 
goblins. so it is recommended that the charac 
ters receive bonus experience points if they 
manage to destroy it. Consider awarding 400 
points if the destruction is total; scale the 
number down for less effective sabotage. 

53- DINING HALL 

The doors to room #53 arc locked. 

In this large room, four bog tables, each 
bracketed by a pair of benches, easily iden 
tify the room's purpose. Two of the tables 
arc covered with dirty bowls and spilled 
wine, as if a meal had been eaten recently. 


If the characters enter this room before they 
enter the kitchen (room #54), then one round 
after the characters enter this room, the door 
to room #54 swings open; rwo very small gob 
lins carrying large, empty trays stroll in. They 
squeak with fright at the sight of the intruders 
and rush back from whence they came to alert 
two other goblins in room #54; all four then 
rush into the hall to alert the guards in room 
#57. The guards appear in three rounds. If the 
characters have already been to room #54, the 
goblins will already have alerted the guards.

54. KITCHEN 

The door to the kitchen is locked. 

This room contains a large oven, two cook- 
stoves, and a pantry filled with dried 
beans, grain, some stale bread, and 50 
cheap ceramic bowk. 


If the characters come into this room before 
they enter the dining hall (room #53). four 
goblins run out of the kitchen, through the 


dining hall, and into the hallway. From here, 
the goblins will rush to alert the guards. The 
guards will appear in eight rounds. 

55. PAGAN TEMPLE 

The double doors to this chamber are 
unlocked and swing open easily. Any lawful 
cleric entering this room feck chills run down 
hk or her spine. This effect may be unsettling, 
but it is harmless. 


In this room, seven sets of bare wooden 
benches face a raised dais, upon which sits 
the likeness of the same hideous god 
encountered several other times. This 
statue k carved from pumice, rather than 
the granite. 


Two glittering gems adorn the eyesockets of 
this statue. Each k a fist-sized stone worth 300 
gp, but they are set very firmly. Any character 
not wearing metal armor can scramble up the 
statue to pry the gems loose, but it takes 
2d6 +2 rounds to remove each one. Only one 
character at a time may try to loosen the gems. 

Each gem is hooked to an elaborate trap, 
which k sprung unless removed by a thief. 
Note that each gem's trap must be removed 
individually. If a trap k sprung, the statue's 
mouth drops open and fout robber flies buzz 
angrily into the room. They attack the charac 
ters randomly, although one k certain to go 
after the character stealing the gems.

56. SMALL SECRET CHAMBER 


Thk small chamber contains only a ladder 
disappearing through a hole in the floor. 


If the characters climb down the ladder, they 
see a small tunnel (three feet wide and five 
feet high) leading due north for 30 feet. A 
strong smell of carrion hangs in the air. At the 
end of the corridor k the cage in which the 
robber flics were kept. A simple calculation 
shows it k directly under the statue in room 
#55. If the statue's traps have been sprung, 
the cage k empty except for a rotting piece of 
unidentifiable meat. 

57. READY ROOM 

The doors to thk room are unlocked. 


68 








THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


A group of goblins and hobgoblins arc 
seated around two tables and three wood 
en benches. A few coins are scattered 
about the tabletops. 


The room is a place for a complement of gob 
lin and hobgoblin guards to wait while they 
are "on call." The guards arc fully armed and 
armored, and respond quickly to any threat to 
their stronghold.

If the party attacks, one of the hobgoblins 
tries to slip out the back door to alert the hob 
goblins in room #65. The other guards fight a 
delaying action until reinforcements arrive. It 
takes five rounds for the hobgoblins to arm 
themselves and run to the fight. 

The coins on the tables include 13 gp and 
25 sp on one table and 24 gp and 51 sp on the 
other. 

58. AVIARY 


This room is actually a giant birdcage. 
Having heard the door open, a flock of 
brightly colored birds have taken to the air 
from a number of perches. They utter 
piercing shrieks as they zoom toward you. 


The hobgoblin king has captured a flock of 
deadly piranha birds, and keeps them here, 
feeding them only rarely. They are half- 
starved and ravenously attack any creature so 
unfortunate as to have opened the door to the 
room.

For a complete description of piranha birds, 
see New Monsters. 

On the south wall of the room b a series of 
closely-spaced bars that blocks the opening to 
a secret door. It b from here the piranha birds 
arc fed. A small gate in the bars may be 
opened to allow access to the cage, but it b too 
small for a character-even a halfling-to pass 
through. 


59. BATTLEROOM 


This room b void of furniture. The bodies 
of two humans who obviously died vio 
lently are sprawled across the floor. One b 
wearing plate mail and carries a shield and 
a sword whose blade is broken; the tip of 
the sword lies across the room from the 
body. Strapped to hb back b a quiver hold 
ing a dozen arrows and a longbow. The 
other dead human b wearing deeply 
gashed, leather armor. A shortsword lies 
on the floor near his body. 


The longbow b actually a longbow + 1. Both 
corpses show signs of mutilation, having been 
partially devoured by a thoul in room #60. In 
fact, for every turn the party spends in room 
#59, there b one chance in four the thoul 
comes into the room from the secret door con 
necting rooms #59 and #60. If the thoul 
charges in. both the PCs and the thoul should 
check for surprise. Chances are one in two that 
if the thoul comes through the secret door, he 
trips over a third corpse: the invbible body of 
a dead magic-user lying directly in front of the 
secret door. 

The dead magic-user b invbible because of 
a ring of invisibility he wears. The body can 
only be discovered by using a detect magic 
spell or by stumbling into it. If the parry 
searches the room, chances are one in five per 
character that someone stumbles into the 
body. If a character states he or she b searching 
the room's east wall for secret doors, the char 
acter b sure to stumble over the corpse. The 
magic-user's body has no value save the magi 
cal ring. 

60. LAIR OF THE THOUL 


A lone hobgoblin appears to be the only 
occupant of thb otherwise empty room. 
He b squatting in a comer gnawing on an 
old bone. 


The hobgoblin b actually a thoul. 

Thoul (1): AC 6; HD 3**; hp 13; MV 120' 
(40'); #AT 2 claws; D 1-3/1-3 + paralysb: 
Save F3; ML 10; AL C; regenerates 1 hp/ 
round. 

The thoul attacks intruders with savage inten 
sity, attempting to paralyze as many characters 
as possible by attacking a different individual 
each turn. The thoul has nothing of value in 
its room. 


61. PARTIAL STATUE 

The door to thb chamber b not locked. 

The only item in thb room b a huge block 
of pumice. The top half of the block is 
carved into the likeness of the pagan god 
encountered elsewhere. The bottom half is 
still shapeless. 


62. TRAPDOORS 

These 40-foot long trapdoors are activated from 
the throne room of the hobgoblin king (room 
#66). The doors do not open as long as someone 
b seated on the throne, as b the case the first 
time the characters come down thb hall. 

When the seat b vacant, the weight of four 
characters causes the doors to swing open, 
plummeting those four characters down a 
300-foot chute below the trap and depositing 
them in room #70 (dungeon level ?) through 
a hole in the room's ceiling. There b a 75% 
chance any characters walking immediately 
behind the four also fall into the chute. Any 
characters who do not fall into the chute are 
isolated in thb dead-end section of the 
dungeon, though they can still shout to their 
fallen compatriots below. 

Characters falling through the trap acci 
dently take 1-3 points of damage each from 
the jostling and bouncing on the way down 
the long, curving chute. Characters falling on 
purpose can slide all the way down without 
incurring any damage. Characters who fall on 
purpose can communicate the safety of the 
slide to characters still above. 

The chute b very smooth-sided; it b impos 
sible to climb back up-even by a thief who 
successfully rolls to climb sheer surfaces. A 
levitation or fly spell could get one character 
up, but getting the whole parry up thb way 
would be a slow and awkward process-even if 
the party has enough spells to make it possi 
ble. If some characters remain above, a long 
coil of rope could be used to pull the fallen 
characters back up, but it b much more likely 
all the characters will slide down the chute to 
continue the adventure. 

63. HOBGOBLIN HALL 


Thb room b obviously a drinking and 
meeting hall for a degenerate band of 
monsters or humanoids. It b empty of 
creatures now, but many signs of use are in 
evidence. Chairs have been pulled careless 
ly back from the long tables, and spilled 


69 








THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


tankards of wine lie on both the tables and 
the floor. A sooty fireplace at the north end 
of the room holds but ashes. There is noth 
ing of value in this room except for three 
shields hanging on pegs on the wall. 


This room is the meeting hall for the hobgob 
lin king and his band. The ashes in the fire 
place arc warm to the touch. 

64 . HOBGOBLIN SLEEPING 
QUARTERS (EMPTY) 

This chamber waits behind a locked door. 


In this room, 14 filthy bunks show signs of 
recent habitation. Each of the beds has a 
mattress of moldy straw, and a blanket on 
top. 


Any character prodding the blankets, or pick 
ing them up and moving them, has a 50% 
chance of hosting a band of fleas. Characters 
so infested need ld6 + l rounds to brush the 
fleas off. If attacked, flea-infested characters 
may fight normally, but nothing other than 
combat allows them to stop brushing off the 
fleas. 

If the party smashed in the door to this 
room before they have investigated chc room 
across the hall (room #65). the chances arc 
three in four they wake up 14 hobgoblins 
sleeping there. The hobgoblins dress and arm 
themselves, bursting out of room #65 and 
into room #64 in two rounds. 

65. HOBGOBLIN SLEEPING 
QUARTERS (OCCUPIED) 

This chamber is identical to room #64. except 
that 14 hobgoblins arc sleeping on the bunks 
around the room. The hobgoblins are armed 
and ready for combat one round after awaken 
ing. but the PCs automatically gain initiative 
on that round.

Each hobgoblin is armed with a sword and 
protected by a shield. 

Since they are mistrustful even of each other, 
each hobgoblin's valuables are kept in a small 
pouch around his waist. The pouch contains 
2d6 gp. 2d6 ep, and 2d6 sp. 


66. HALL OF THE HOBGOBLIN 
KING 

The huge double doors to this room arc not 
locked. This chamber is where the hobgoblin 
king holds sway over his minions on and in 
The Hill. 


A huge hobgoblin is seated on the throne 
at the south end of the chamber. One hob 
goblin bodyguard is standing to each side 
of the throne. Four other hobgoblins arc 
seated around a huge fire burning in the 
center of the room; two more hobgoblins 
are drawing liquid from a keg in the south 
west comer of the room. Apparently, some 
kind of party is going on because the atmo 
sphere in the room is festive.

The king's personal bodyguards are armed 
with spears, one of which is a spear +i. The 
king is wearing a ring of fire resistance, so he is 
invulnerable to normal fires and gains a bonus 
when saving against magical fires. 

When the doors to the room are open, the 
hobgoblin king shouts a warning and orders 
his soldicts to attack. As long as the king is 
alive, the hobgoblins fight with a morale of 
10; if the king is killed, they fight with a 
morale of eight. 

The fire in the center of the room is heating 
a large kettle of boiling liquid, which vaguely 
resembles soup. In fact, it is soup, but the 
characters find it rancid and foul-tasting, 
though not poisonous. The smoke from the 
fire is vented through a large hole in the ceil 
ing. 

Each of the eight hobgoblins has a belt 
pouch containing a few coins: 2d6 gp. 
ldlOcp, and 3d6 sp for each pouch. On his 
belt, the king carries a ring of keys, including 
those to the doors of rooms #68 and #69. and 
to the chests in room #69. The hobgoblin 
bodyguard who carries a magical spear carries 
on his belt the key to the chest in room #67. 

67. BODYGUARD CHAMBER 

Room #67 is the chamber of the two hobgob 
lin bodyguards. 


Two soft beds, a table, two chairs, and a chest 
are the only items of furniture in this room. 
The table holds a bottle of wine and two 
glasses. 


The chest is locked; the bodyguard who carries 
the magical spear has the key on his belt. In 
the chest arc two woolen cloaks; a large sack 
containing 120 gp, 60 ep, and 200 sp; two 
swords; and a jeweled necklace worth 800 gp. 
The wine on the table is high quality. 

68. BEDROOM OF THE KING 


A large, plush bed, a table, a wooden 
chair, and two soft armchairs constitute the 
furniture in this room. Three woolen tap 
estries hang on the walls. 


Although of rather shoddy craftsmanship, the 
tapestries are colorful and worth 50 gp apiece. 
They depict battle scenes in which hobgoblin 
exploits are prominently featured. 

69. TREASURE ROOM 

A secret door to room #69 may be discovered 
by the normal roll. Turning a loose stone in 
the wall reveals a key socket. If the key is used, 
or if a thief can pick the lock, the door swings 
open easily. 


This tiny room is empty except for two 
large chests. 


The keys to these chests are on the belt of the 
hobgoblin king. Each chest is trapped with a 
poison needle, activated if a thief picks the 
lock without removing the trap. If the trap is 
activated, the thief must save vs. poison or 
die. Using the proper key opens the chests 
without activating the trap. 

The first chest contains coins of many dif 
ferent types, including 58 pp, 230 gp, 170 ep, 
480 sp. and 1,290 cp. The coins are mixed 
together; trying to son them takes three turns. 
The second chest contains four bottles of 
murky liquid-three bottles of potion of heal 
ing and one bottle potion of invisibility -and 
a pearl necklace worth 1.000 gp. 

ADVENTURE IN 
DUNGEON LEVEL II 

As explained in the description of area #62, 
characters gain entrance to this dungeon level 
by falling through the trapdoors in the corri 
dor outside the chamber of the hobgoblin 


70 









THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


king (room #66). 

It takes a steady hand to map this level of 
the dungeon-a mass of twisting and turning 
tunnels. Each has rough, rocky walls, a 10- 
foot high ceiling, and are clean of debris (a 
gelatinous cube regularly sweeps all areas of 
this level). Many tunnels slope gradually up or 
down, crossing over or under other tunnels 
the party is not aware of. Whenever two corri 
dors intersect on the map, one is shown by 
doned lines; the other is marked by the usual 
solid lines. The corridors marked by dotted 
lines pass under the corridors marked by solid 
lines. 

If a dwarf wants to check for sloping pas 
sages. examine the party's location on the 
map. If the group is within 60 feet of inter 
secting solid and dotted lines, and if the dwarf 
is successful on his roll, consult the map again. 
If the passage the PCs are on is underneath 
another tunnel, the slope is down; if the pas 
sage is on top of another tunnel, the slope is 
up. Of course, if the dwarf asks for a check at 
time when the party is not within 60 feet of an 
intersection, you roll for him anyway, but the 
result is always "no slope." 

When giving the characters descriptions of 
the twists and turns of these tunnels for map 
ping purposes, don't be too specific. Direc 
tions such as: "The corridor is gradually 
bending to the "left," or "You come around a 
sharp curve to the right" is adequate, unless 
the characters ask for more specific terms. If 
they do, explain to the characters that 
demanding such precision is slowing them 
down. Try to estimate the angle of a curve (90 
degrees, 45 degrees, etc.) as closely as possi 
ble, but remember that the party isn't going 
to measure the exact angle anyway, so slight 
inaccuracies are inevitable. 

This level is never traveled by the hobgob 
lins; in fact, they have no knowledge of the 
creatures living here or the makeup of the 
dungeon. The creatures on this level are a 
crazed and half-starved lot, living a desperate 
and hungry existence: they are quick to 
assault any potential meal. 

Many packs of rats scuttle about, living in 
tiny holes in the walls of the tunnels. The rats 
are the staple food of the residents of this area. 
The rats are used to running for their lives, so 
they never attack a character. You might men 
tion occasionally that the party hears the rats 
squeaking or scratching, but the party never 
actually sees them. 

Desperate for food, certain creatures roam 
the corridors. The chance of encountering a 
group of these wandering monsters is calcu 
lated as usual at the end of every two turns. If 
an encounter is indicated, roll ld6 and com 


pare the result to Table 6.

70. OCTAGONAL ROOM 


After bumping and sliding down the 
chute, you land on the floor of an eight 
sided room, a wooden door on each side. 


One of the doors (roll ld8 to determine which 
one) opens ld6 rounds after the characters 
land in the room; two men, filthy and unshav 
en, run wildly into the room, a maniacal 
expression in their eyes. In fact, they arc ber 
serkers and attack the party on sight.

One of the berserkers is wearing leather armor 
+ 1 (AC 6). 

These two are part of a group of humans who 
have been wandering through the labyrinth of 
this level for many years. They have forgotten 
any human language they ever knew, commu 
nicating in a series of grunts, hoots, and 
shouts. 


71. BUGBEARS' CAVE 

A rank smell emanates from this cave. If the 
PCs come within 30 feet of the cave, the odds 
are one in three they become aware of both 
the smell and the cave. 


In this dirty chamber, three large and furry 
humanoids are squatting listlessly. As they 
sec you. they yell a challenge and spring to 
their feet. 


The trio of bugbears accidentally fell down 
the trap chute several months earlier; they 
claimed the cave and attack humans and 
demi-humans on sight.

The bugbears fight with huge, knotty pieces 
of wood they use as clubs. They have no cloth 
ing, armor, or anything else of value. 

72. LARGE CAVERN 


The ceiling to this large chamber is 20 feet 
high. The floor is clean of debris. 


73- CHAMBER OF THE 
MAN-EATERS 


This large cavern appears to be empty. The 
ceiling is high, and the far end curves out 
of sight. 


This chamber is the Lair of a band of ghouls 
who happily cat humans or any other vaguely 
warm-blooded creature that they can sink 
their filthy claws into. Though the cave 
appears to be empty from its entrance, around 
the bend in the wall lurk the cave's four cha 
otic (and hungry!) inhabitants. 

Ghouls (4); AC 6; HD 2*; hp 13, 11. 10, 8;

The ghouls are squatting around a pile of mis 
cellaneous bones at the spot marked by an X 
on the map. Unless the characters arc very 
noisy, check normally for surprise. In any case, 
the ghouls attack the characters on sight. 

Garbage the ghouls have collected lies piled 
against the wall next to their pile of bones. 
Most of the garbage is merely old belt buckles, 
links from chain mail, strapless shields, and 
the like. A few items of value might be turned

up, however, if the characters wish to dig 
through the refuse. Valuables include 23pp in 
an old sack; 80 gp. 100 sp, and 200 cp scat 
tered around the floor; a jeweled necklace 
worth 100 gp; and a battered, corroded sword 
that is actually a shortsword + 2. The sword is 
not recognizable as a magical weapon unless 
considerable time is spent scraping the corro 
sion off of the blade. However, it functions 
with its + 2 bonus whether it is cleaned or not. 

74. SECRET CHAMBER 

The two secret doors leading into this room, 
and the secret door connecting the room to 
room #75, arc opened by rotating a small out 
crop of lock in the center of the door. 


Several small flying creatures dan from the 
door, zooming toward you. You can sec 
several more of these bird-like things 
immediately behind the first ones. The 
room beyond appears to be empty. 


When an entry door is opened, each character 
standing in the doorway is attacked by two 
surges apiece. The rest of these blood-sucking 
parasites fly past the first rank of characters to 
find sustenance from those in the rearward 
ranks. All the surges make an attack on the 
first round out of the chamber. 

Surges (8): AC 7; HD 1*; hp 8. 7, 6, 5. 4, 3. 
2, 1; MV 180'(60'); #AT 1; D 1-3; Save F2; 
ML 9; AIN. 

These birdlike predators have been living off 
the rats that occasionally enter their chamber 
through small holes. The stirges haven't had a 
decent meal in years; they try eagerly to attack 
any character so unfortunate as to have 
released the parasites from their cavern. 

75. SECRET TREASURE ROOM 

The secret door to this chamber is opened the 
same way as arc the two doors leading into 
room #74. From the vantage point of the 
secret door, room #75 appears empty; a char 
acter must advance down a short hallway to 
see the chamber's contents. 


In an alcove along the room's western wall 
lie three small, wooden chests. Each is fit 
ted with a sturdy lock. 


The first chest contains coins of all types: 38 
pp, 120 gp, 70 ep, 250 sp, and 1.000 cp. The 
second holds valuables made of silver, gold, 
and gems: a silver pitcher and 6 goblets (200 


gp). a fabulous jeweled necklace (400 gp). a 
bracelet (200 gp). a bejcwclcd dagger (100 
gp). and a golden serving tray (300 gp). The 
third chest contains potent magical items: a 
bottle each of potion of diminution and poi 
son. two boides of potion of hading, a sword 
+ 1, a suit of plate mail +1, and a ring of fire 
resistance. 

76. CAVERN OF THE GIANT 
SHREWS 


In a far-north alcove of this chamber lies a 
large pile of leather and cloth. 


Inside the pile are three adult shrews and six 
young. As the leading character advances into 
the room, the adult shrews bound out in fury, 
lashing at the intruders with razor-sharp 
teeth. The young arc too small to engage in 
combat.

Note that giant shrews always gain initiative 
on their first attack; for their second attack, 
they gain + 1 to their initiative roll. A silence 
If' radius spell will ''blind" them, since they 
use batlike radar to find their way about the 
darkness. 

77. OWL BEAR DEN 


This long cavern winds back into darkness. 
The air feels moist here. 


This cavern contains a well of fresh, cool 
water, and an owl bear 

Owl Bear (1): AC 5; HD 5; hp 22; MV 120' 
(40'); #AT2 claws, 1 bite; D 1-8/1-8/1-8: 
Save F3; ML9; AL N; can "hug" for exua 
damage. 

The owl bear is jealously possessive of its den. 
and will attack and attempt to maul any char 
acters who stroll through the entrance. The 
bear will be resting at the spot marked with an 
X on the maps so that it has a view of the 
mouth of its den. When it attacks, the owl 
bear will direct both of its claw attacks and its 
bite to the same character, repeating the 
attack until that character has been killed 
before selecting a new victim. It will not pur 
sue characters beyond the mouth of its cave if 
it has already killed one; if not. it will pursue 


until it slays a character. It will then cease pur 
suit and drag the corpse back to its den. 

78. BERSERKER'S HOVEL 

This cavern has been claimed by the small 
band of insane humans struggling to survive 
the dungeon. Two of these fellows the party 
met in room #70. Although some of the ber 
serkers are out wandering the tunnels, the PCs 
find five in this chamber. 

Berserkers (5): AC 7 (5); HD 1 +1*; hp 9. 7. 
7. 6, 5; MV 12'(40'); #AT 1 at +2; D 1-8; 
Save FI; ML 12; AL N. 

The nine hit point berserker carries a shield 
+2 for AC 5. 


A large human sits on a tall stone chair 
pathetically resembling a throne. He is 
wrapped in a tattered, purple carpet, hav 
ing donned it like a robe. Four other men 
kneel at his side. 


The berserker on the throne considers himself 
Derywinki III, Emperor of the Lower World. 
He carries a long wooden staff and a shield 
+ 2: he is quite mad His voice booms com- 
mandingly if he catches sight of the charac 
ters, even if they are simply walking past the 
mouth of his cave: "Who seeks an audience 
with Derywinki III? Kneel, peons!" 

If the characters do not fall immediately to 
their knees, the emperor flies into a rage: 
"Impudent swine! You shall know the wrath 
of the Emperor of the Lower World! Guards, 
arrest them!" At this command, the four 
kneeling bciscikers. followed closely by the 
emperor, rise and assault the party in full ber 
serk fury. 

If the characters kneel before Derywinki. he 
is mollified for the time being. He asks his 
"subjects" if they are happy and healthy, and 
why they seek an audience with his illustrious 
self. Judge the characters' response very care 
fully. Remember that the berserkers truly 
believe they are the custodians of a mighty 
underworld empire; they are sure to be 
offended if the characters were to state that 
the nearby owl bear is fomenting revolt, the 
emperor and his berserker subjects would 
march to slay the rebellious monster. 

Behind the throne, a small wooden chest 
contains the Empire's treasury. The chest is 
locked, and Derywinki lost the key years ago. 
but the lock may be picked or the chest 
smashed. A character can smash the chest 
open by making a successful "open doors" 
roll. The chest contains 12 pp, 45 gp, and 180 
gP

79. GELATINOUS JANITOR 

This spot in the corridor is where the party 
scumbles across the gelatinous cube. The crea 
ture is constantly on the move: when encoun 
tered, it is moving southwesterly, toward 
cavcm #80. 

Gelatinous Cube (1): AC 8; HD 4*; hp 19; 
MV 60'(20'); #AT 1; D 2-8 + paralysis; 
Save F2; ML 12; AL N; surprise on 1-4. 

If the cube surprises the party, it attacks a ran 
domly selected character in the front rank. If 
the party is not surprised, figure combat and 
damage normally. 

While sweeping the dungeon, the gelati 
nous cube has picked up a few small treasures 
it has not been able to dissolve. Once the crea 
ture is dead, characters can remove from 
inside the creature; 12 gp and 47 sp. 

80. WELL 

This chamber contains a well of clear water. 
Twelve feet deep, the well originates from a 
small spring at its base. The water is drink 
able. No creatures live in this cavern. 

81. SECOND OCTAGONAL 
ROOM 


This eight-sided room has eight identical 
doors spaced evenly around the walls. 


This room is identical in all respects to room 
#70. When they first enter this room, the 
characters probably think they are back to 
room #70, and of course you shouldn't try to 
correct this misunderstanding! 

82. PIT TRAP 

At this spot in the corridor, trapdoors have been 
placed above a pit, 10 feet deep. Unless the par 
ty is actively looking for traps, the first two char 
acters stepping onto the trapdoors trigger their 
opening. Characters immediately behind the 
first pair must successfully check their dexterity 
or fall into the pit (they must roll their dexterity 
score or less on a d20). Characters that fall take 
ld6 points of damage 

83. STEAM VENT 

This large cavern has one of the now-fa mi lia r 
steam vents in the northeastern end. There is 
10% chance per turn that this vent erupts 
with the usual scalding burst of steam, pre 
ceded by one round of bubbling and hissing, 


and doing ld6 points of damage per round to 
characters caught in the steam. 

Residing in this chamber-reveling in the 
occasional bums of steam-arc a lava lizard 
and a swarm of steam weevils.

For a complete description of both these mon 
ster types, see New Monsters. 

If the party enters the cavern, the steam wee 
vils immediately advance to swarm around a 
single character. The lava lizard, however, 
waits in the center of the cavern, moving to 
attack only if the party advances to within 20 
feet of it. 

84. UNDERGROUND STREAM 


A chute of rapids is about 100 feet on the 
right. The rapids spill into a placid stream 
before you. which meanders out of sight to 
the left. Stretching 35 feet on both sides of 
you is a dry shelf. 


This stream is the only means of escape from 
this level of the dungeon, other than climbing 
back up the chute that spills into room #70. 
The stream leads to dungeon level III. 

If the characters stay on the shelf, there is 
the normal chance to encounter a level Ill 
wandering monster. 

Greenish, phosphorescent lichens grow 
along the walls bounding the stream, allowing 
characters to see 100 feet away. If the party 
tries to move upstream, the force of the rapids 
is too strong; it knocks them back to their 
starting spot within 1-3 rounds. 

Moving downstream, however, is relatively 
simple. Most of the stream is only one or two 
feet deep; the bottom is smooth sand and fine 
gravel. In a few places along the 500 feet lead 
ing to dungeon level III. halflings may have to 
be lifted onto others' shoulders, but there is 
no danger of drowning or being washed 
downstream. 

Along the stream are five more dry shelves 
where the party may elect to camp or rest. If 
they do, they encounter no wandering mon 
sters. This area is one of the few places the 
characters don't have to worry about combat!

THE HOBGOBLIN KING 


ADVENTURE IN 
DUNGEON LEVEL III 

This deepest and most deadly of the dungeon's 
levels also holds the key to the patty's return to 
the outside world. The characters have to bypass 
many enemies to escape, however, not the least 
of which is a young red dragon. 

Level III comprises a series of winding run 
nels and several large caverns. All these areas 
were formed either by volcanoes or by the ero 
sive trickling of water through the ages , a few 
elements of artificial origin were added to the 
caverns-the steps leading to cavem #90. the 
doors to room #99, for example-but by and 
large, the forces of nature take credit for this 
grim, foreboding haunt. 

A dramatic geological fault line crosses the 
dungeon level's middle; elevation changes 
suddenly along either side of the fault line; 
the northern end of the level is generally 50 
feet lower than the southern end. Characters 
encounter this sudden shift in elevation at the 
cliffs near caverns #94 and #95. and at the 
rockslide near cavem #97. 

Check for wandering monsters normally; if 
an encounter is indicated, check Table 7 to see

ty sights this shelf of rock 100 feet ahead. 

Illuminated by the greenish phosphores 
cent glow, a flat shore is visible about 100 
feet ahead on the left. A small humanoid 
figure stands on the shore. 


Two more of these humanoids (kobolds) are 
napping in an alcove. 

Kobolds (3): AC 7; HD 1 / 2 , hp 4 . 2.2 ; MV 60' 
(20'); #AT 1; D 1-4; Save NM; ML 6; AL C. 

The kobolds arc on guard duty, instructed to 
report to their chief if they sight any creatures 
coming down the stream. So many years have 
passed since the kobolds have encountered 
any intruders from this direction, however, 
that the guards arc not taking their duties very 
seriously. When the characters first sight the 
kobold, there is a 20% chance the little 
humanoid secs them as well. If it doesn't the 
party may advance to 50 feet away, when there 
is a 50% chance they are observed. If they are 
still not seen, they can reach the northern 
edge of the landing, but then are automati 
cally sighted. When they are, the lone kobold 
shouts to his fellow guards asleep in the 
alcove. Obviously, if any of these kobolds 
escape, they run to warn the rest of the kobold 
band. In this event, the party can hear the 
blast of the warning horn from the south. 

86. KOBOLD STORAGE ROOM 
AND LAIR 

As the characters reach the point where the 
corridor to cavem #86 branches off, they see a 
dull red light flickering ahead of them. This 
light is a volcanic glow emanating from the 
crevasse that splits room #87. 

If no guards escaped from the landing (area 
#85), the party hears a clashing of swords com 
ing from cavem #86. Four young kobold sol 
diers are practicing their swordsmanship 
inside the cavem. 

If one or more of the guards at the landing 
did escape, the four kobolds arc no longer in 
cavem #86; instead they are waiting for the 
party at the bridges to cavem #87. along with 
other kobold soldiers.

60'(20'); # AT 1; D 1-5 (ld6 -1); Save NM; 
ML 6; ALC. 


If these kobolds are still in the cavem, they are 
in the northern portion; in the southern 
alcove are several shoddy wicker bins. The 
bins contain fish and rat bodies, scaled or 
skinned, presumably for use as food. 

87. THE BRIDGES OF DEATH 

This large chamber is split by a 20-foot wide 
crevasse. The crevasse is 300 feet deep, and at 
its bottom flows a river of molten lava. Obvi 
ously it's "curtains" for any creature who falls 
into it. 

The south side of the crevasse is guarded by 
five kobolds at all times. If any kobold the 
party encountered on the landing (area #85) 
or in cavem #86 had a chance to escape, an 
alarm has been sounded; all the kobolds from 
caverns #88 and #89. as well as any kobolds 
escaping the landing or cavem #86. have 
arrived to support the five kobold guards. 

If no alarm has been given, the leader of the 
five guards blows a brass horn he carries at his 
side as soon as the intruders are sighted. Rein 
forcements arrive within three rounds. 

Kobolds (5): AC 7; HD 1/2; hp4. 3, 3. 2, 1; 

MV 60'(20'); #AT 1 spear or shortsword; D 

1-5; Save NM; ML 6; AL C. 

Each of the five carries two spears. 

The five kobold guards defend bridges A and 
B by standing at the southern ends of the 
bridges and throwing their spears at the char 
acters. The PCs cannot see bridge C until they 
reach the edge of the crevasse. If a character 
tries to cross it. one of the kobolds tires to 
block the character by standing on the south 
ern end of the bridge. 

Any character or kobold who is wounded 
while on a bridge must check against dexterity 
(roll his or her dexterity score ot less on a d20); 
if the check fails, the individual is knocked off 
balance and falls into the chasm. For purposes 
of this roll, all kobolds have a dexterity of 10. 

If called by the hom, reinforcements from 
room #86 approach the bridges from the 
north. The reinforcements from cavem #88. if 
called by the hom, reach the bridges from the 
south. The reinforcements from room #89 
reach the bridges through the secret doors 
exiting at the southern end of bridge C. Note 
that when the kobold chieftan arrives, the 
morale of all of the kobolds is eight.

88. CHIEFTAN'S COUNCIL ROOM 

In this chamber, die kobold chief and his 
bodyguards dwell in modest splendor. If dis 
covered in the council room, the chief and his 
six bodyguards are sitting in the center of the 
room drinking a foul-smelling brew. More of 
this nauseating liquid is fermenting in a large 
kettle at the northern end of the room.

The chief carries a shortsword + 2. 

Around the chiefs waist is a belt made of gold 
and silver coins linked by a chain. The belt is 
worth 250 gp. but it constitutes all of the 
monetary wealth owned by the entire tribe of 
kobolds. If a character examines the liquid in 
the kettle, it is identifiable as a kind of beer 
made mainly from fishheads. 

89- KOBOLD LAIR 

Most of the kobold tribe occupies this room. If 
they have not been called to the defense of the 
bridges. 12 kobolds are here, languishing 
about. 

Kobolds (12): AC 7; HD 1/2; hp4.4,4, 3. 3. 
3. 2. 2. 2, 1. 1, 1; MV 60'(20'); #AI 1; D 
1-4; Save NM; ML6; ALC. 

There are 15 dirty pallets of sand and dried 
grass in the room, a few pieces of half- 
consumed rat, and several bottles of the 
fishhead beer. The room contains nothing of 
value to the party. 

90. EMPTY CORRIDOR 


This short hallway branches off near the 
top of a 50-foot high stairway. The floor is 
littered with broken rock and other stony 
rubble. 


91. CHAMBER OF DARKNESS 


Utter blackness consumes a 10-foot wide 
stretch of the corridor wall. You can see 
nothing but the darkness. 


Many years ago, a very evil cleric met an 
untimely end in this cavern and a strange 
magical phenomena took place: the black 
force of the evil cleric's soul took possession of 
the cavern, causing total darkness. 


If the characters thrust a torch into the dark 
area, the torch seems to disappear. But if they 
withdraw it, it burns brightly. Only a light 
spell can illuminate the room. 

There is nothing dangerous or harmful in 
the room, and in fact characters can find valu 
able treasure here. If they have no magical 
light, however, they must explore the cham 
ber in darkness. For each character entering 
the room, there is a 15% chance per turn a 
character locates the skeleton of the dead cler 
ic and the backpack he carried. This chance is 
cumulative, so if three characters search the 
room, there is a 45% chance per turn one of 
them discovers the corpse and backpack. 

The backpack contains two rolled-up parch 
ments and three bottles of colored liquids. 
The parchments are scrolls containing the fol 
lowing spells: 

Clerical 

First Level: cure light wounds (x2) 

Second Level: bless 
Magic-User 

First Level: magic missile 
Second Level: phantasmal force 
Third Level: fire ball 

The bottles are magical potions. One bottle 
holds two doses of potion of healing; another 
holds two doses of potion of growth; and a 
third holds two doses of potion of invisibility. 

92. and 93. EMPTY CAVERNS 


This network of rooms and tunnels has a 
floor littered with broken rock and dust. 
No tracks arc visible. 


94. and 95. KOBOLD-GUARDED 
CLIFFS 

These two corridors expand and then drop 
away in 50-foot cliffs, and rock outcroppings 
stud the walls. A single kobold is on guard at 
the top of each cliff. 

Kobolds (2): AC 7; HD 1/2; hp 3. 2; MV 60' 
(20'); #AT 1; D 1-4; SaveNM; ML6; ALC. 

The kobolds are lying prone, watching the corri 
dors below them that approach horn caverns #92 
and #93. If the party sneaks up on them horn 
behind, add +2 to the kobolds' chances of 
being surprised. If the party is below the 
kobolds. however, add +2 to the characters' 
chance of being surprised, and allow NO chance 
for the kobolds to be surprised. 

If a thief tries to climb one of these cliffs, 


the kobold on top waits until the thief is half 
way up. and then drops stones at him or her 
(roll "to hit" normally). Each stone hitting its 
mark does 1-4 (ld4) points of damage. The 
thief must check against dexterity if struck. If 
this roll fails, the thief falls. Consider his fall 
to be from halfway up the cliff; give 1-6 (ld6) 
points of damage for each 10 feet fallen. 

Characters below may shoot arrows or other 
missiles at the kobolds. but the kobolds have 
an AC of 3 because the cliff shields them. 

96. LARGE CAVERN 


This large chamber contains many stalac 
tites and stalagmites, some of which are 
broken and littering the floor. 


97. ROCKSLIDE 


The cliff here has gradually crumbled 
away, leaving a jumble of huge boulders. 
The rockslide lowers from south to north; 
the bottom is 50 feet lower than the top. 
The slope looks gentle enough to climb. 


All characters may move both up and down 
the rockslide. but calculate movement at one- 
quarter the normal exploring rate. In addi 
tion. a hidden menace is coiled in the exact 
center of the slide. 

Giant Rattler (1): AC 5: HD 4*; hp 15; MV 
120'(40'); #AT 2; D 1-4 + poison; Save 
F2; ML 8; ALN. 

The snake senses any character moving onto 
the rockslide, and immediately begins to rat 
tle. The snake is hidden in the rocks, however, 
so the party cannot see it. If the characters con 
tinue to move up or down the slide, the snake 
slithers forward and tries to intercept the near 
est character. If the snake fails a morale check, 
it disappears into the rocks, bothering the PCs 
no more. 

98. DEN OF THE LAVA LIZARDS 


Two large, iguana-like lizards arc in the 
middle of this natural cavern. They are 
perfectly still, and their eyes seem to be 
closed. 


These are lava lizards They remain asleep 
unless touched. Once something comes into 
contact with one of them, however, they both 
awaken and enter into combat on the next 
round.

For a complete description of the lava lizard, 
see New Monsters. 

Characters may walk around the lizards and 
open a door at the rear of the cavern without 
disturbing the creatures. Even loud noises do 
not wake them. 

99. OLD WARRIOR'S CAVERN 

The door to this room is a sturdy slab of stone; 
add + 1 to a character's roll to open. 


It is obvious this room has been inhabited, 
presumably by the poor warrior whose 
skeleton-still clad in plate mail armor- 
rests on the room's lone chair. A mighty 
sword lies by the warrior's side. Also visible 
arc a wooden table and a straw pallet bed. 


These are the remains of a human warrior who 
was trapped on this level years ago. On the 
warrior's back is a quiver holding five arrows 
+ 2. He wears plate mail + 1 , and the sword at 
his side is a sword +1(+3 against dragons). A 
broken longbow lies on the floor under the 
table. 

The secret door leading from his chamber 
may be opened by rotating an outcrop of rock. 

100. DRAGON'S ENTRY ROOM 

The winding corridor leading to this cavern is 
only three feet wide, so characters must travel 
in single file. The dragon is too large to move 
down this corridor. 


This room is empty except for six small and 
blackened skeletons on the floor. 


A close examination reveals the skeletons 
belonged to koboids; any casual observer can 
see they have been savagely burned. 

101. LAIR OF THE RED DRAGON 

The secret door on the far east side of this 
cavern opens into the cavern by rotating an 
outcropping of this rock. Characters entering 
this cavern from the secret door enter directly 
behind a red dragon, who is unaware of the 
door's existence. 


This chamber is huge and dark. You feel an 
aura of evil, and from the darkness ahead, 
you can hear deep, slow breathing. 


The red dragon living in this cavern is quite 
youthful by a dragon's standards, but it is still 
an awesome and terrible opponent. Its lair is 
connected to the outside by a tunnel nearly a 
mile long. 

Red Dragon (1): AC -1; HD 7; hp 22; MV 
90' (30'); #AT 2 claws/1 bite/ + breathes

Spells. 

First Level: ventriloquism, charm person, 
detea magic. 

Second Level: detect invisible, continual 
light. 

Third Level: dispel magic 

There is a 10% chance the dragon is asleep 
when discovered. If the characters encounter 
the dragon, then escape and stay away for at 
least six turns, there is a 10% chance again the 
dragon will be asleep when they return. 

If some characters invisibly enter the room, 
the dtagon is awate of their presence due to its 
keen hearing, unless the character is a thief 
who successfully rolls to "move silently." If the 
dragon is aware of even one invisible charac 
ter, it casts its detect invisibile spell. The 
dragon is then able to see any invisible indi 
viduals or objects in the room. As long as the 
party is not fighting the dragon, it is satisfied, 
however, merely to keep tabs on those who arc 
supposedly invisible. 

When the crafty serpent first becomes 
aware of the PCs, it does not immediately 
bake them with its fiery breath. Rather, it uses 
its ventriloquism spell to create a sound of 
great roaring and bellowing behind the party. 
When it is convinced that all the party mem 
bers are in the room, it chuckles deeply before 
greeting them with the utmost politeness. It 
enjoys conversational banter and since it sure 
ly doesn't feel threatened by the presence of a 
band of mere humans, it may spend 2-12 
(2d6) turns chit-chatting with the PCs. 

The serpent is sitting upon a large collec 
tion of coins and other valuable items. It will 
react very favorably to compliments and flat 
tery, and will even allow characters to advance 
and examine the many treasures in its trove if 
the group is appropriately respectful. 

The dragon attacks if the characters try to 
leave the cavern, or if the party moves to 
attack the dragon. In both cases, roll for initia 
tive normally: note that the dragon always 
uses its breath weapon as its first attack. 

If the characters do not attack the dragon 
and do not attempt to leave the room, be 
aware of when the dragon grows weary of con 
versation (2-12 rums): its comments should be 


more cun and impolite, even hostile. If the 
characters still do not attack within rwo 
rounds, the dragon attacks anyway. 

On the first round, the dragon tries to hit 
the greatest number of characters with its 
breath weapon; after that the dragon attacks 
as explained in the Basic Rules (roll a ld6; a 
one, rwo, or three means the dragon uses its 
claw and bite attacks; a four, five, or six means 
it uses its breath again). 

If the players are able to kill or subdue the 
dtagon, they find as much treasure as they can 
carry. The pile beneath the dragon includes 
7.000 cp, 10,000 sp, 5.000 cp, 2,000 gp, 800 
pp. and assorted gems (500 gp x20), and jew 
elry (1,000 gp, 750 gp, 600 gp, and 500 gp 
x2). Also buried among the coins are a ring of 
protection +1, a wand of magic detection 
(eight charges), a rod of cancellation, and a 
bag of devouring. 

The tunnel exiting the dragon's lair climbs 
gradually for a mile until it exits north of the 
ruined monastery. 

TY ING UP THE LOOSE ENDS 

Since the party has arranged its return trip, 
they should have no particular problem get 
ting back to Guido's Fort-unless, of course, 
they happen to be accompanied by a subdued 
red dragon! 

The dragon is clearly too large and heavy to 
put into a fishing boat. If the party tries to do 
so, the boat sinks. Another smoke signal 
might bring another fishing boat, or the party 
could build a raft. 

Seeing the boat is too small, the PCs might 
try to coax the dragon into swimming along 
side the boat, which the dragon does, though 
clumsily. 

If the party needed the mage during the 
adventure, he will seek them out and claim his 
price. His choices are, in order: a subdued 
dragon, the rod of cancellation, any ring, any 
wand, any +2 item. 

If the characters arc wondering what to do 
with a subdued dragon, they can find a mage 
at the Lion's Den who offers to buy the 
dragon. He offers 5,000 gp but the PCs can 
bargain for up to 10.000 gp, the mage's final 
offer. It is recommended the dragon pass from 
the campaign but if you choose to let them 
keep it, the dragon will refuse to go adventur 
ing and should remain, in a campaign con 
text, a source of prestige for which the 
characters pay heavily.

Adventure background 

Deep in a lush, enchanted forest lies a pleas 
ant clven village. For years, the whole village 
prospered. The people lived from the forest 
around their mountain village and temple. 

Four weeks ago, an evil human cleric, 
known only as "the Rahib," broke into the 
temple. He was looking for a treasure-a 
young maiden's dowry, rumored to be in the 
temple. Instead, he discovered a secret cavern 
under the temple. The cavern contains the 
ruins of an ancient wizard's tower. 

While exploring the ruins, the Rahib dis 
covered three witches whose spirits' were 
trapped in statues. The witches, Karclcna, 
Solorcna, and Trilena, convinced the Rahib to 
help them escape. To escape, each witch must 
take over a maiden's body, trapping the maid 
en's spirit in the statue where the witch was. 

Using the witches' knowledge, the Rahib 
magically charmed and enslaved the Siswa- 
the elven students and teachers who lived in 
the temple. Two nights ago. the Rahib and the 
charmed elves sneaked into the village and 
kidnapped two elven maidens, Sylva and 
Mcrisa. The Rahib freed Karelcna and 
Solerena, trapping Sylva and Mcrisa's spirits. 
The Rahib has only to kidnap Rahasia, the 
most beautiful elven maiden, to free the last 
witch, Trilena. 

When they arc all free and together, the three 
witches arc each much more powerful than when 
alone. So, until Trilena is freed, Karelcna and 
Solorcna will not leave the tower ruins. 

While delivering a package to the village, 
the PCs find a message and meet Rahasia. the 
most beautiful elven maiden. Her father and 
her betrothed both went to the temple, but 
never returned. 

The PCs must go to the temple and find 
Rahasia's father and betrothed. Then they 
must find the cavern, release the imprisoned 
clven maidens and destroy the Rahib and the 
witches. 

DM Notes 

The Siswa (elven students and teachers) who 
were charmed by the Rahib are not really 
responsible for their anions because they are 
magically controlled. Encourage your players 
to think of ways to get around the Siswa with 
out killing them. The charm keeps them in a 
dream-like state, but it is possible to talk to 
them The charm also changes their align 
ment to chaotic. When the Rahib and the 
witches are destroyed, the Siswa change back 
to normal. Until then, however, they follow 
the Rahib's orders. 


When the PCs encounter the witches, 
remind the players that the witches are using 
the bodies of clven maidens. Encourage the 
players to think of ways of capturing and 
defeating the witches without inflicting physi 
cal damage. If the PCs capture a Siswa or 
witch, give the PCs the appropriate experience 
points. If they kill a Siswa or witch, subtract 
the experience points from the PCs! 

To capture, rather than kill, a Siswa or 
witch, the players must say they are trying to 
capture their opponent Then, count all dam 
age toward unconsciousness, rather than 
death. NPCs fall unconscious when their hit 
points reach zero. PCs should usually have 
enough time to tie up unconscious enemies 
before they wake up. PCs cannot capture non 
living opponents and creatures such as the 
water weird (see New Monsters). 

Certain areas in the temple and tower con 
tain magical portals. The portals magically 
connect two places. Some portals only send, 
others only receive. When characters pass 
through a sending portal they instantly appear 
at its receiving portal. Characters cannot tell 
when they pass through a portal, unless chey 
realize they are not where they expected to be. 
Once characters go through a portal, they can 
not come back the same way. Objects put pan 
way into sending portals cannot be 
withdrawn; they must go all the way through. 

The player characters can use the elven vil 
lage as a base during the adventure. Empha 
size that the elves arc taking a great risk in 
hiding the characters between adventures. 
The amount of equipment the characters can 
get between adventures is limited to what a 
woodland community can provide. There are 
no local high level NPCs for training or heal 
ing, although limited numbers of healing 
potions can be made available if needed. 

Starting the Adventure 

The player characters have turned off the Duke's 
Road, following Sindar's directions, when they 
notice the woods around them is somehow dif 
ferent. Elves will immediately recognize that this 
is an clven wood At some point in their passage, 
stop giving general descriptions and begin with 
the first boxed description. 

THE FOREST 


The beautiful elven forest sleeps peacefully 
about you. Leafy green trees with silver 
and white trunks stand in blissful grandeur 
as far as you can sec. The trail you walk 


77 














RAHASIA 


winds toward the high mountains nearby 
to the north. The forest's carpet of ferns 
and deep green bushes is punctuated by 
the bright teds, blues, and yellows of the 
abundant woodland flowers. 

Ahead, sunlight flashes off metal lying 
in the path. Armor-elven armor-and 
whoever wean it is not moving. 


The elf on the trail died not long ago, perhaps 
slain by bandits. His annot is crumpled and 
useless. A search of the body reveals only a 
piece of parchment bearing a message in both 
Common Tongue and Elvish. 

Up the mountain path lies the elven vil 
lage. Beyond, a mountain of gray stone 
thrusts up from the sweet meadow grasses. 

Let the players read Rahasia's letter on the 
pull-out page at the end of the book. 

THE ELVEN VILLAGE 


In the village, the delicate elven dwellings 
mirror the grace of their people. Yet the 
faces of the villagers reveal great sadness. 
You soon are lead to an elven maid, whose 
veiled grace and beauty outshines all oth 
ers present as the sun outshines the stars- 
she is Rahasia. 

"Will you aid me?" she asks. 


If the characters accept, the elves will provide 
food and shelter, but no other aid, though 
they will hide badly wounded characters from 
the Siswa while they heal. The elves cannot 
tell the PCs very much about the temple 
because all the elves who are familiar with the 
temple are under the Rahib's control. The 
elves do know, however, that the temple was 
protected by a powerful guardian before the 
Rahib came. They think that the Rahib must 
have destroyed the guardian. They also show 
the PG; sketches of the kidnapped maidens, 
Sylva and Merisa. Rahasia accompanies the 
characters to the roadside shrine on their way 
to the temple. 

If the PCs refuse to help Rahasia and the 
other elves, they are politely, but firmly, sent 
on their way-they arc not wanted and their 
presence could bring down the wrath of the 
Rahib. In the woods beyond the village, the 
PCs are ambushed by a large group of Siswa 
led by the Rahib. The PCs arc showered with 
vials of sleeping gas with no chance to make 
saving throws. The PCs arc taken to the tem 
ple and locked in cells f, g. and h in area 49. 
The PCs wake up in those cells and must 
escape from there. 


ADVENTURE IN THE TEMPLE OF GRAY MOUNTAIN 


Many years ago, friendly dwarves helped the 
elves built most of the temple in return for 
protection and aid from the elves and Elyas. 
The upper level chambers are natural caverns 
where the elves worshipped. The passages 
were carved out by the dwarves. 

Since the arrival of the Rahib, the Siswa 
rarely visit the upper level of the temple. The 
entire upper level is unlit and unused. Thick 
dust covers most things and cobwebs arc com 
mon throughout. The Siswa use the stairways 
in the counyard shrines to reach the lower 
levels. 

If captured Siswa are questioned about the 
temple, they only explain how they used to 
use the temple, saying: 


"When we come to the temple, we climb 
the steps to the temple doors (14). Passing 
through the doors, we turn to the right and 
stop in a small room (15) to put on robes of 
worship. Then we walk down the hallway 
through a large cavern (16). Next, we 
move along another hallway (17) past sev 
eral small rooms. We then go through a 
magical passage (18/32) to another hall 
way. From there, we enter the main temple 
(35). where we worship. When we finish, 
we leave the main temple (35) and go 
down a hallway, through a magical ponal 
(33/21) to another hallway (22) that is 
strewn with flower petals. That hallway 
opens into the temple of the Siswa. The 
Well of Punishment is in that room. After 
returning our robes we leave the temple." 


GETTING TO THE TEMPLE 

A trail leads from the elven village into the 
mountains. Before the PCs leave the village, 
the elves give them a map of the area (Map l) 
and warn them of wandering bands of Siswa 
who attack and slay outsiders. The PCs do not 
encounter anyone on the way to the temple, 
but you should roll a few false encounter 
checks to keep the players guessing. About 
halfway to the temple, the PCs come upon the 
roadside shrine. 

THE ROADSIDE SHRINE 

Use Map I for the Roadside Shrine. 


A small roadside shrine sits near the path 
to the temple. 


Rahasia stops here to offer incense. The 
shrine's entrance is in the center of the west 
wall, and the main room is 15 feet square. In 
the north and south walls arc 10-foot-by- 10- 
foot alcoves. 

Before the northern alcove is a small statue 
of a strong-looking man with a long beard, sit 
ting upon an altar with his legs crossed. Raha 
sia tells the PCs that the man was, Elayas, a 
mage of great power, the founder of the Quiet 
Way and the spiritual leader of the Siswa. He 
disappeared in a horrible battle with three 
witches who attacked his tower-home many, 
many years ago If the PCs try to investigate 
the statue or the alcove behind it, Rahasia tells 
them that they must not disgrace the Old One 
by walking past his gaze. (This custom pre 
vents outsiders from entering the temple 
unannounced, but this reason is long forgot 
ten.) 

The northern alcove is a magic portal that 
teleports anyone entering it to area 41 on the 
lower level of the temple. The southern alcove 
is a receiving ponal from the same area. 

Courtyard and Upper Temple Level 

Use Map 2 for areas 1-24, 

In the courtyard and upper level, check for 
random encounters every third game turn. 
Roll ld6. A result of 6 means the PCs 
encounter something. When an encounter 
occurs, roll Id 12 and use the resulting 
encountet on Table 1 (inside back cover). 

1. OUTSIDE THE TEMPLE 


The gates of the temple are silver double 
doors that are 30 feet wide overall. They 
are ornately carved with forest scenes, and 
stand silently shut. The outer walls of the 
temple arc vine-covered stone, and about 
20 feet high. At the corners of the south 
wall, delicarc domes rise 10 feet above the 
walk. 


The gates can be opened as normal doors. 
There arc no guards. Rahasia will not enter the 
courtyard. She tells the PCs she will hide in 
the brush nearby, waiting for their return.

RAHAS1A 


2. COURTYARD 


The double doors open into a courtyard 
that is 80 feet deep and 90 feet wide. Once 
well cared for. the dirt floor is now choked 
with weeds. In the center of the yard sits a 
large pool. Just beyond the pool is a set of 
stain leading to the main doors of the tem 
ple itself. Four wooden sheds are attached 
to the west wall, and another four to the 
east wall. In the southern comers of the 
courtyard are two small octagonal stone 
buildings, each covered by a delicate- 
looking dome. The buildings are about 30 
feet wide. 


3-10. SMALL SHEDS 


The shed is a 10-foot-bv-20-foot area with 
a din floor and thatched roof. The shed's 
rear wall is formed by the counyard wall. 
The shed's walls are made of woven reeds 
on a wooden framework. 


All of the sheds are empty, except number 7. 
It contains two leather sacks marked with the 
word "Tithe" in Common Tongue and 
embossed with two small black panthen. Each 
sack contains 250 cp. 

11. COURTYARD POOL 


The pool is 40 feet long and 30 feet across. 
Its stone rim rises three feet above the 
ground. The water within has gone brack 
ish and putrid, looking almost glossy 
black 


A water weird (see New Monsters) lives in the 
pool. It anacks any living creature that dis 
turbs the water. It ignores objects that are 
thrown into the water, though. 

Water Weird: AC 5; HD 3; hp 12; MV 60' 

(20'); ifAT 1; D 1 + drowning; Save F6; 

ML 12; AL C: XP 35 

The water weird is guarding two large jars at 
the bottom of the pool. Each jar contains 150 
cp, 350 sp. and 200 gp. Buried in the murky 
filth at the bottom of the pool arc 6 gems, 
worth 100 gp each. Characters have a 2 in 6 
chance of finding one gem in the black scum 
each turn they search. Characters may search 
as long as they like. Characters who splash 
about in the water for more than three turns 
attract a wandering monster from Table 1. 


12. SOUTHWEST SHRINE 


This is an octagonal room, 30 feet in diam 
eter. The floor is din; the walls and domed 
ceiling are made of stone. A 2-foot-high 
platform covers the far half of the room. A 
set of stairs leads downward on each side of 
the platform. In the center of the platform 
rests a statue of a man sitting with his legs 
crossed. He appears very strong and has a 
long beard. The statue is 15 feet tall. 


This shrine is empty. The stairs lead to area 25 
on middle level. 

13. SOUTHEAST SHRINE 

Use che boxed description of area 12. This 
shrine is the same as area 12 except that these 
stairs lead to area 26, and a hungry gargoyle is 
hiding behind the statue in this shrine. The 
gargoyle springs out and attacks when the 
characters enter the shrine. The gargoyle will 
not chase the characters if it is thrown food. or 
has an unfortunate adventurer to munch on!

Scattered on the platform behind the statue 
are 80 gp, 4.000 sp, and the remains of some 
half-chewed leather sacks. A careful search 
reveals a scrap of leather with two black pan 
thers embossed on it. 

14. UPPER TEMPLE ENTRYWAY 


Beyond the double doors is a 10-foot-long 
entryway. A large, ornate compass rose is 
carved into the center of the floor. The 
entryway leads to an arched hallway run 
ning east and west. The hallway is 10 feet 
wide and a total of 50 feet long. At each 
end, the hallway opens into a large cham 
ber. On the north wall, immediately across 
from the entryway, is the faint drawing of a 
hand pointing east. Two curtained-off 
doorways lead from the south wall of the 
hallway. One doorway is just west of the 
entryway; the other is east of the entryway. 


The hallway is empty. The hand directs the 
Siswa on a counter-clockwise circle of the tem 
ple. 


15. CLOAK ROOM 


This chamber is 10 feet wide by 20 feet 
long. In the southeast comer of the room 
are two large brass coffers. Atop each is a 
large, lit candle. Dozens of small pegs line 
the walls at about shoulder height. 


Each coffer contains 550 cp and 50 sp. The 
coffers are not locked or trapped. Behind the 
coffers is a pile of dirty rags-the worthless 
remains of the Siswa's village clothing. 

The Siswa continue to light candles daily in 
this room. Their robes have not been brought 
back since the last ceremony. Some old robes 
are in area 16. 

16. TEMPLE OF THE INITIATES 


This is a roughly diamond-shaped cavern, 
covered with dust. Archways in the north 
and west comers lead to 10-foot-wide 
arched hallways. Footprints in the dust 
lead from the west archway out through 
the north archway. Overhead, the ceiling 
opens into a great dome filled with stalac 
tites. A broad platform juts from the 
southeast wall into the center of the room. 
On the platform is a statue of a man with a 
long beard, who sits with his legs crossed. 
A small altar stands before the statue. A 
dusty pile of folded cloth lies before the 
altar. 


The pile of cloth is actually ten temple robes, 
old, but neatly folded. The robes are long and 
brown, with deep hoods and sleeves. Usually, 
a character of roughly eiven build who wears 
the robes has an 80% chance to fool any Siswa 
he meets into thinking that he. too, is a Siswa. 
Other creatures in the temple arc fooled and 
do not attack 60% of the time. Adjust the 
chance of fooling by characters' sizes and 
actions. In general, check only once each 
encounter-using the worst chance for the 
group-unless the situation requires addi 
tional checks. Remember that the Siswa only 
speak Elvish. 

17. HALL OF THE WORLDLY 
WALK 


This 10-foot-wide arched hallway runs into 
the darkness. Several 10-foot-wide dark 
rooms branch off both sides of the hallway. 


The rooms are empty, except for dust and cob 
webs.

RAHASIA 


18. HALL JUNCTION 

Thcic arc magical portals in areas 18, 21. 31. 
32. 33. and 34. The portals are marked on the 
maps with a T (for Teleporter) or an R (for tele 
port Receiver). When the PCs pass through 
these portals, they are turned to face a new 
direction, without knowing it. Unless they see 
one of the compass roses in the temple (in area 
14, 29. and 35), they do not know the true 
compass directions. When they do not know 
the true compass directions, describe what 
they sec by using their (faulty) compass direc 
tions or. more simply, by using "left," 
"right," "ahead," and "behind." 

If the PCs have not passed through one of 
the portals, use the following boxed descrip 
tion as it is. 


Two hallways meet here. Several shadowy 
figures and flickering Lights are moving 
around far to the north. 


Area 19 is west of this intersection. Area 17 is 
to the south. The hallways to the north and 
east arc not true halls, they arc magical por 
tals. Area 21 also contains portals like these. 

The north portal teleports anyone entering 
it to area 32 on the middle level. The east por 
tal sends anyone entering it to area 34 on the 
same .level. These portals are one-way only 
(down). Characters who move through one 
cannot return; they find only a cold stone wall 
behind them. 

However, light glasses through the portals in 
the opposite direction (from 32 to 18 and 
from 34 to 18). The light makes the portal 
look like a very long hallway. Sound does not 
pass through the portals in any direction. 
Thus, a character who goes through can be 
seen by characters on the other side, but can 
not be heard. 

The shadowy figures and flickering lights 
are the PCs themselves! The arrangement of 
the portals allows the PCs to sec themselves 
280 feet away. Their image goes from 18 to 21 
to 31 to 32 back to 18. At such a distance it is 
impossible to make out details, of course. 

19. REAR HALL 


This 1 0-foot-wide arched hallway is filled 
with cobwebs. It runs into the distant 
darkness. 


Aside from a single curtained opening in the 
center of the north wall, this hallway is empty. 


20. STORAGE ROOM 


A long room, 10 feet wide and 30 feet 
long, lies on each side of the opening 
behind the curtain. In the room to the left, 
under the light of burning torches in wall 
sconces, five brown-robed figures crouch 
in a circle. They mutter among themselves 
as they sharpen wicked-looking blades in 
the flickering light. 


The figures are Siswa. and they are huddled 
around two leather sacks. They do not notice 
the party unless disturbed. Each sack contains 
150 gp. Embossed on the outside of these 
sacks are two black panthers and the word 
"Tithe" in Common Tongue.

21. HALL JUNCTION 

There is a magical portal here. The magical 
portals are explained in the text for area 18. 

If the PCs have not passed through one of 
the portals, use the following boxed descrip 
tion as it is. 


Hallways run south and east from this 
junction. West and north of this junction 
lie two 10-foot-wide hallways filled with 
dark shadows. The hallways end in stone 
walls 20 feet away. 


As the party enters the junction, four human 
bandits run out of the north wall and attack! 
The bandits come through the portal at area 
33. The bandits are not surprised. The PCs arc 
surprised on a roll of 1 or 2 on ld6. If the PCs 
are surprised, the bandits make one free 
attack. Then roll fot initiative for the first 
round of normal combat. 

After their first attack, the bandit leader 
yells, "They aren't Siswa!" The other bandits 
look confused. Immediately get the PCs' reac 
tions. The bandits stop fighting unless PCs 
attack them. If the Siswa in area 20 are still 
active, they run out toward the noise and 
probably attack. If they do. the bandits join 
the PCs against the Siswa. The bandit leader's 
name is Teikus.

These bandits are wearing leather armor and 
arc armed with short swords. 

The bandits are totally lost They came into 
the temple to steal and went down the south 
eastern shrine stairs. They were seen and pur 
sued. so they started tunning down halls at 
random trying to get out. They picked up five 
leather sacks along the way and will gladly 
hand some over in exchange for directions 
out. Fifty ep are in each sack. The sacks arc 
marked with two black panthers and the word 
"Tithe." 

Their encounter with the party is a com 
plete accident, so you should role-play their 
efforts to get out (with some treasure) to the 
hilt. 

22. HALL OF THE TRUTHFUL 
WAY 


A 10-foot-wide arched hallway runs into 
the darkness ahead. Off both sides of the 
hall arc arched openings into several small 
rooms. Dust covers the hallway and old 
flower petals, now brown and dry, crackle 
underfoot. 


The flower petals were strewn by Siswa before 
the Rahib arrived. In each alcove is a stone 
statue of a philosopher or sage of the Siswa. 
There is nothing of value in any of the rooms 
except room 22e. 

A statue of an clvcn sage stands in room 
22c. Around the neck of the stone statue is a 
golden pendant with a black jade stone. It is 
worth 1,300 gp. Rahasia's father carried the 
pendant with him to the temple. After help 
ing Ular-Taman in area 42, he was seen by the 
Siswa and hid in this dead-end room. Realiz 
ing he would soon be captured, he placed the 
pendant upon the statue and called on the 
spirit of the sage to protect it. He was cap 
tured, but the Siswa could not remove the 
pendant. Rahasia's father was taken to the 
Well of Punishment and thrown down to the 
third level. The pendant has rested here 
undisturbed since then. 

Anyone not of lawful alignment who tries 
to take the pendant while it is on the statue is 
hit by a blue boll of electricity from the statue. 
The bolt inflicts ld8 points of damage to the 
offending character (who does not get the 
pendant). 

Lawful characters can examine the pendant 
on the statue. The pendant is pan of a talis 
man of power, described in the Appendix 
under New Magical Items.

RAHASIA 


The only way to remove the pendant is to 
insen the proper ring into the indentation in 
the pendant. The ring is hidden in area 42. 
After the pendant is removed from the statue, 
any chatacter may handle it safely. 

23. TEMPLE OF THE S1SWA 


This is a roughly diamond-shaped cavern, 
covered with dust. Archways in the north 
and cast corners lead to 10-foot-wide 
arched hallways. Footprints in the dust 
lead from the north archway out through 
the east archway. Overhead, the ceiling 
opens into a great dome filled with stalac 
tites. The cavern's walls arc covered with 
fresco paintings of the natural beauties of 
the world. The frescoes arc somewhat fad 
ed and look long uncared for. A broad 
platform juts from the southwest wall into 
the center of the room. A 15-foot-tall 
statue of a strong man with a long beard 
sits on the platform with his legs crossed. 
There is some sort of altar in front of the 
statue s knees. 


The cast archway leads to area 14 (the enttyway). 
The north archway leads to area 22. The altar is 
actually the 4-foot-wide mouth of the Well of 
Punishment, whose 10-foot-diamctcr shaft 
drops down into darkness. The shaft drops 50 
feet to area 48 on lower level. Its damp walls arc 
too slippery for even a thief to climb. 

24. CLOAK ROOM 


Thick dust covers everything in this room. 
Dozens of pegs line the walls at shoulder 
height. Suddenly, a slender figure hurtles 
from the darkness, shouting a warrior's 
challenge. 


An clvcn warrior-seer, Alki, hid here when he 
heard the PCs coming. Unless the PCs try to 
talk to aim. Alki will fight to the death. 

Alki was one of the original elves summon 
ed to help Rahasia, but he arrived at the tem 
ple after the others. He already has used his 
two spells. He will gladly join the PCs if 
invited. Alki is devoted to beauty, and thus to 
Rahasia.

Middle Temple Level 

Use Map 3 for areas 25-35. 

In the middle level, check for random 
encounters every third game turn. Roll ld6. A 
result of 6 means the PCs encounter some 
thing. When an encounter occur, roll ld8 
and use the resulting encounter on Table 1. 
Do not use encounters 9-12. 

Directly below the courtyard, on the mid 
dle level, are living quarten of the Siswa 
priests. The personal cells of the priests circle a 
central dining hall. The stonework in this area 
is all dwarven. The floor-stones are worn 
smooth and the ceiling is damp. The Great 
Temple (area 35). however, is a natural cavern 
within the gray stone itself. It is surrounded 
by hallways (some arc magical) that were cut 
around the central cavern. 

25-26. STAIRS 

These two stairways look identical. The stair 
way at 25 splits into two sets of stain that rise 
to the southwest shrine, area 12 on the upper 
level. The stairway in area 26 connects with 
the southeast shrine, area 13 on the upper 
level. 

27. PRIESTHOOD CELLS 

There are seven openings on one side of 
this 10-foot-widc hallway. The openings 
arc blocked by heavy curtains. 

Each cell contains a cot of woven reeds, several 
dirty rags, and a pile of stones. None of these 
items have any value. There is nothing ebe in 
any of the cells, except celb 27f, 27g, 27n. and 
27o, listed below. 

27f. PRIESTHOOD CELL 


Within this cell is a woven reed cot with a 
chest under it. several rags, and a pile of 
stones. 


Dans smeared with sleeping ointment spring 
from the chest the moment the lid is lifted. 
Any character who is in the way must make a 
saving throw vs. poison or fall asleep for ld6 
turns. 


Within the chest are 200 sp, 150 ep, a bot 
tle and a half of fine wine and a pair of smooth 
stones. 

27g. PRIESTHOOD CELL 


A flickering light comes from this cell. 
Three brown-robed figures huddle around 
a candle on the floor. They sway back and 
forth as they repeat a chant that makes no 
sense to you. 


Three Siswa are chanting here. They become 
most unreasonable if their chanting is dis 
turbed. They attack outsiders. 

Each character who attempts to pass this cell 
without being noticed has a base 65% chance 
of doing so. Thieves may add their move 
silently ability to this base chance if they state 
they are doing so. If any character faib, the 
Siswa notice immediately.

28. HALL OF THE SISWA 


This room is 30 feet wide north to south, 
and 50 feet long cast to west. Double doors 
stand in the center of the north and south 
walls. Smoking torches dimly illuminate 
the tows of dark, stained tables and bench 
es that fill the room. Half-woven baskets 
stand on two of the tables. Two 10-foot- 
squate alcoves are cut into the centers of 
the east and west walls. Over the western 
alcove is carved the word "KESIN1." while 
over the eastern alcove is carved the word 
"KESANA." 


The alcoves are magical portals. Unlike the 
portals in the upper level, light cannot pass 
through these portals, nor do they look like 
halls The east alcove (KESANA) only sends; 
it teleports anything in it to a garbage-filled 
marsh north of the temple Anyone entering 
the east alcove materializes 15 feet above the 
garbage and falls into the swampy mess. 
There are no difficulties getting back to the 
clven village from the swamp. 

The west alcove (KESINI) only receives 
things from the southern alcove in area 41. 
Entering it has no effect. The Siswa receive 
their food from the western alcove (KESINI). 
After eating, they throw their scraps into the 
eastern alcove (KESANA) where their magical 
disposal system removes the trash. 

29. SISWA GUARDS 


Flickering torches light this area. Ahead, 
beyond openings to the east and west, is a 
pair of double doors. An ornate compass 
rose is carved into the floor in front of the 
doors. At the openings, two brown-robed 
figures step out to bar your way. Both 
silently raise gleaming curved blades. 


The north doors lead to area 30; the south 
doors lead to area 27. These Siswa guards may 
not attack immediately, but they do attack 
anyone they believe are not Siswa. They will 
fight to the death (or capture).

30. HALIWAYS OF THE GREAT 
TEMPLE 

There are magical portals at the ends of these 
halls. The portals are explained in the text for 
area 18. 


These four halls encircle the Great Temple. A 
gelatinous cube, brought here by Karclcna 
and Solorcna, guards these halls. It moves 
about constantly, cleaning the halls and pro 
tecting the Rahrb's stronghold from unwant 
ed guests. The cube attacks anyone in the 
halls, but it never leaves area 30. 

To determine where the cube is when the 
PCs first enter these halls, roll ld4 on Table 2. 
below. Every turn the PCs stay in these halls, 
roll any die once. An even roll moves the cube 
one hallway clockwise. An odd roll moves the 
cube one hallway counterclockwise.

35. THE GREAT TEMPLE 


Strong wooden double doors, ornately 
carved with forest scenes, open into a huge 
natural cavern. The cavern is eight-sided 
and 70 feet across. It is brightly lit by oil 
lamps on the walk. The walk rise 30 feet. 


then open into a great 40-foot-high metal 
dome. A large compass rose is carved into 
the floor in the center of the room. There 
arc three doorways; one in the center of the 
west wall, one in the center of the east wall, 
and one in the center of the south wall. A 
raked platform juts 30 feet out from the 
north wall. At the back of the platform sits 
a 15-foot-tall day statue of the strong man 
with the long beard. At the front of the 
platform is an altar. A black-robed figure 
stands behind the altar, burning incense. 


The figure behind the the altar k the Rahib. 
At the first sign of intruders, the Rahib throws 
hk arms in the air and disappears in a flash of 
smoke and flame. He actually drops through a 
trap door behind the altar that leads to area 36 
on the lower level. There k no way the PCs can 
prevent hk escape at this time. 

The statue is a huge, day-covered bone 
golem. Sec New Monsters for detaik about 
thk creature. As soon as anyone not wearing a 
Siswa robe comes within 20 feet of it, attacks 
it. or does any damage to the altar area, the 
golem attacks. The golem's dried mud cover 
ing cracks and falk away, tcvealing its four 
skeletal arms, each holding a wicked-looking 
sword. The golem fights until the intruders 
leave area 35. Then it returns to its place on 
the platform. Thk golem hopelessly outclasses 
any typical party, so the players must think of 
a way past thk creature (the robes work, of 
course). 

Long ago, Elyas specially constructed thk 
golem from the bones of a giant to protect the 
temple. Karelena and Solorcna helped the 
Rahib figure out how to keep it from attacking 
him.

36. MEDITATION ROOM 


The walls of this 30-foot-wide octagonal 
room are covered with aged fresco paint 
ings of trees and peaceful mountain 
scenes. 


A staircase in the north wall leads to a trap 
door behind the altar in area 35 on the middle 
level. 

If the PCs spend more than one round in 
this room, the spirit of Rahasia's father 
appears as a ghostly form. He is a haunt. See 
New Monsters for details about haunts. Raha- 
sia's father is a stately elf with piercing, yet 
gentle, eyes and a melodious voice. He cannot 
cause or take damage. He identifies himself, 
recites the following message, then disap 
pears. He will not reform or answer any ques 
tions. 


"By the RahiBS han>

Rahasia's father was brought here from the 
well. The Rahib tried to force the lore of the 
pendant from him, as well as repeating his 


demands that Rahasia go with him unhin 
dered. When the elf refused, the Rahib slew 
him in a fit of rage. The elf s spirit refuses to 
rest, however, until Rahasia is safe. 

37. LIBRARY 


This room is 20 feet square, with a 10-foot- 
wide alcove in the north end of the east 
wall. Shelves full of books and papers line 
the north and west walls, and a thick mg 
covers the floor. In the center of the room is 
a large table lit by a single burning candle. 
At the table, facing you. sits a dark figure. 


This is the most important encounter on this 
level. The dark figure is the Rahib. He will try 
to destroy the PCs. However, if he doesn't 
think he can fight the PCs and win. he tries to 
escape to area 40. where his panthers arc. 
Role-play the Rahib as intelligently as possi 
ble. The PCs' best move is to rush him and 
overpower him immediately. Buried under 
the papers on the table is a set of keys to all the 
doors in the temple.

39. STUDY 


This is a 20- foot -square room, with a 10- 
foot-wide alcove at the south end of the 
east wall. A table in the center of the room 
is covered with diagrams, drawings, and 
papers. The drawings are of Merisa. Sylva, 
and Rahasia. The diagrams arc plans of the 
elven village, showing the houses, streets, 
and places with thick brush and other cov 
er. The papers are covered with scribbled 
notes. 


There is a secret door on the north side of the 
alcove that leads to the Rahib's bedroom, area

In the study, the Rahib learned of an ancient 
tunnel down to Elyas' tower. The Rahib dis 
covered the secret door in the east wall of this 
room that leads to the tunnel, area 40a. 

If the Rahib gets into this room before the 
PCs, he escapes through the secret door to the 
tower, and may be met later. The secret door 
only opens when a magical word is spoken in 
the alcove. The characters can discover the 
word by studying the Rahib's notes on the 
table in the study (area 39) for 1 hour, or by 
studying the old books and papers in the 
library (area 37) for 1 week. 

40a. ANCIENT TUNNEL 

This thin, dark tunnel winds down from area 
40 through the gray mountain to the gates of 
Elyas' tower, area 50. The tunnel is 180 feet 
long and only wide enough for one character. 
This ancient tunnel was forgotten until the 
Rahib discovered it. 

41. RECEPTION ROOM 


This octagonal room is 30 feet across. It has 
10-foot-square alcoves in the north, south, 
and west walls. These are blocked by gates 
of heavy iron bars. Above the north alcove 
is carved the word, "KESIN1" Above the 
other alcoves are carved the word 
"KESANA." A large gong hangs before 
the western wall. 


The alcoves are magical portals. The northern 
portal is a one-way receiving portal from the 
roadside shrine. The southern portal sends 
anything entering it to the receiving teleport 
in the Hall of the Siswa. area 28 on the middle

Tne Rahib brings food and treasures offered 
at the roadside shrine (and shipments of food 
that he brought there secrcdy) into the temple 
through the northern portal. The food is 
stored in room 46 or sent to the Hall of the 
Siswa, area 28 on the middle level. The gong 
announces a delivery-or the arrival of 
unwanted guests. 

Each time something enters through the 
northern portal, the gong rings with a thun 
derous noise. The iron gate is locked, of 
course. Thieves have one try to unlock the gate 
before the Siswa arrive. That is the only 
chance the party has to avoid capture if they 
enter this way. if they don't get out. the Siswa 
arrive and knock the PCs out with vials of 
sleeping gas. The PCs cannot make saving 
throws. The PCs wake up in prison cells f, g. 
and h in area 49. 

42. ULAR-TAMAN'S ROOM 


Smooth bare stones form the walls of this 
20-foot-squarc room, but a rough cut tun 
nel is carved in the west comer of the north 
wall. In the center of the room, a glittering 
snake-like reptile weaves back and forth. 


The snake-like reptile is Ular-Taman, a crea 
ture created by Elyas long ago. Ular-Taman is 
good. kind, and wise. It prefers characters of 
lawful alignment. Ular-Taman can never leave 
the temple. 

Ular-taman guarded the only known 
entrance to the ruins of Elyas' rower, the Tow 
er Tunnel, area 44a. Out of respect for Elyas 
after he died, the elves never entered the 
ruins. After several generadons, they forgot 
that the ruins existed. The Rahib discovered 
another way into the tower, from area 40. 

When the Rahib took over the temple, 
Ular-Taman fought a terrible battle with him 
and his panthers. Ular-Taman was wounded, 
but managed to drive the Rahib out of areas 
42,43, and 44. So far, the Rahib has not dared 
face Ular-Taman again. 

Rahasia's father helped Ular-Taman recover 
its strength. In return .Ular Taman is guarding 
Rahasia's father's treasure until it is claimed 
for Rahasia. Until it is claimed, Ular-Taman 
will not leave areas 42.43, and 44. 

Ular-Taman also guards a black jade ring, 
which it was to keep for Hasan, but will also 
entrust to Lawful PCs who speak well of Raha 
sia, her father, or Hasan. The ring is part of a 


talisman of power, and is needed to release the 
other pan. a pendant, in area 22e. 

The ring is hidden under a loose stone in 
the floor. Treat the stone as a shifting wall. 
Characters must search the exact center of the 
room to have any chance of finding it. Ular- 
Taman knows the powers of the ring and pen 
dant. but cannot speak of them unless asked, 
and then only after the two arc joined.

If the PCs talk to the reptile, they find an ally 
and gain the black jade ring (if they have the 
pendant). Ular-Taman also tells the PCs the 
following story. 


''Many generations ago, a wizard, called 
Elyas, visited these elven people. He asked 
for a place to live, where he could work in 
peace and solitude. Because his heart was 
true and he respected the elves and their 
customs, they gave him a place in their for 
est where he built a tremendous tower. For 
many yean they helped him and he pro 
tected and taught them, for his magic and 
learning was vast. 

"Their friendship with Elyas was passed 
from father to son, until even Elyas grew 
old. Then disaster struck. Three horrible 
witches attacked his rower. They sought a 
magical gem Elyas owned-the Black Opal 
Eye -for its power could make them 
almost invincible. 

"None of the witches dared face Elyas 
alone, but together they were very power 
ful. In a fiery battle, they called down a 
gray mountain to crush Elyas. As the 
mountain slammed down onto his tower, 
Elyas drew the witches inside it, where he 
trapped them. Unfortunately, Elyas him 
self perished. 

"In his memory, the elves began to 
build this temple on that mountain. Many 
years later a group of dwarves helped com 
plete the temple. The temple became a 
place of quiet meditation and learning. 
Many young elves spend a year here as stu 


dents, known as Siswa. Now, this moun 
tain is known as Gray Mountain. 

"I guard the way to Elyas' tower, but I 
fear the Rahib has found another 
entrance". 


If the PCs ask how to get to Elyas' tower, Ular- 
taman tells them about the secret door in area 
44 that leads to the Tower Tunnel, area 44a. 

If the PCs attack and kill Ular-Taman, it 
becomes a haunt and continues to guard the 
treasure and the ring. See New Monsters for 
details about haunts. Characters that see a 
haunt must make a successful saving throw vs. 
spells or run away. Those characters absolutely 
refuse to enter the area for at least 1 day. 

If the PCs entered this level as captives. 
Ular-Taman directs them to the south portal 
in area 41 that leads to the Hall of the Siswa, 
area 28 on the middle level. Then Ular-Taman 
gives them directions out to the courtyard. It 
also warns them that a dangerous guardian 
protects the Great Temple, area 35. Ular- 
Taman docs not reveal any details of the 
guardian's nature, other than that it has been 
in the temple since the temple was built. 

Siswa are free of the Rahib's control while 
they are in areas 42, 43, or 44. However, they 
fall back under the Rahib's control when they 
leave those areas. 

43. TUNNEL 

This 10-foot-widc tunnel runs northeast from 
the room of Ular-Taman to what appears to be 
a rock slide. The rock slide is actually a secret 
door to room 44. where Rahasia's treasure is. 

44. TREASURE ROOM 


This 30-foot-widc (east to west) by 20-foot- 
deep room holds a treasure of tremendous 
wealth! A solid metal door is set into the 
east end of the south wall. 


The metal door leads to area 45, the stair of 
locks. No one can open the door unless its lock 
is picked or unlocked with the keys from area 
37, the library. 

The treasure is in the center of the room. It 
includes: 800 gp. a sword +1 . a snake staff, a 
ring of animal control, a potion of healing, a 
marble jar with 6 inlaid gems (worth 1.000 
gp). 2 platinum birds (worth 700 gp each), 
and 12 gems (each worth 100 gp). 

A secret door in the north wail leads to the 
Tower Tunnel, area 44a.

44a. TOWER TUNNEL 

This 200-foot-long tunnel leads from area 44 
on the lower temple level to the gates of Elyas' 
tower, area 50. The first 30-foot length of the 
tunnel is eight feet wide. From that point on, 
the tunne! quickly narrows so only one charac 
ter can squeeze through. 

45. STAIR OF LOCKS 

This stairway descends from the secret trap 
door behind the statue in area 35 (the great 
temple on the middle level) to area 44 on the 
lower level. This stairway is blocked by not 
one, but three strong metal doors. The only 
way to pass them is to pick their locks or open 
them with the keys in the library, area 37 on 
the middle level. The Rahib does not know 
about this stairway or the secret trap door in 
the great temple. 

46. STORAGE ROOM 


This is a 20-foot-square room. There arc 
boxes and several broken jars on the floor. 
The room also contains crude ovens and 
casks of wine. 


This is where supplies arc kept and food is 
cooked for the Siswa. One of the boxes con 
tains brown robes. Eight giant rats prowl in 
this room.. They attack anything that moves 
into this room unless distracted with food.

Double doors open into this guardroom. 
Four Siswa guards in chainmail are posted 
here. Directly across the room is another 
set of double doors. 


The guards' orders are to let no one pass unless 
the Rahib is present and instructs them other 
wise. The guard leader carries the keys to all 
the cells in area 49- 

If the PCs are escaping from the cells, you 
may reduce the number of guards in this area 
to make their escape possible; assume the oth 
er guards are with the Rahib.

48. WELL BOTTOM 


This is the bottom of a deep, 10-foot-wide 
shaft that extends straight upward into 
darkness. It is sealed off from the hallway 
at its base by a heavy iron gate. Piled at the 
bottom of the well arc stuffed leather mats 
that prevent damage from a fall down the 
shaft. The walls of the well are damp and 
too slippery for even a thief to climb. 


The iron gate is locked. Trying to smash 
through the gate alerts the guards. The alert 
ed guards use vials of sleeping gas to capture 
the PCs before they can break through. To get 
through quiedy. the PCs must pick the lock. 

49. PRISON CELLS 


A long, dark hallway tuns east and west. 
Heavy wooden doors with barred windows 
line both sides of the central hallway. A 
similar door stands at the cast end of the 
hallway. A gate of iron bars blocks the west 
end. 


The cells arc 10 feet square and empty except 
as noted below. The keys to all the cells are 
carried by the guard leader in area 47. 
Another set of keys is in the library, area 37. 

If the PCs are captured, they arc locked in 
cells f. g, and h. If the entire party is captured, 
encourage them to plan their own escape. Any 
reasonable plan will work-for example a 


thief might pick the door lock with a piece of 
scrap metal, a very strong character may work 
a door bar loose, or the PCs may plot to sum 
mon and ambush the guards. Captured PCs' 
weapons and other equipment is piled in 
cells, which is not locked. Other prisoners can 
only be freed by picking the locks to their cells 
or using the keys. 

Locked in cell b is a tall human fighter 
named Baik Telor. He wandered into the road 
side shrine and was caught by the Siswa. He 
will gladly join the party if he is given weap 
ons. He is wearing chainmail. and his dress is 
somewhat Arabian-turban and loose silk 
breeches.

ELYAS' TOWER 


The adventure in Elyas' Tower forms the sec 
ond half of this adventure. The characters can 
be allowed to rest in the elven village before 
continuing. 

Halls of Grandeur 

Use Map 5 for areas 50-84. 

The upper floors of Elyas' tower were com 
pletely destroyed in the battle between Elyas 
and the three witch sisters, Karelena. 
Solorena, and Trilena. Much of the remaining 
tower was scorched by fires that raged after the 
combat. 

In the Halls of Grandeur, check for random 
encounters every third game rum. Roll ld6. A 
result of 6 means the PCs encounter some 
thing. When an encounter occurs, roll ld6 
and use the resulting encounter on Table 3 
(inside back cover). 


50. GATES OF THE TOWER 


The tunnel opens into a dark, dry cavern, 
deep within the mountain. No sound 
breaks the silence in the cavern. Gray stone 
walls rise up 60 feet to the cavern's rock 
and earth ceiling. This structure appears to 
be an ancient tower, buried under the 
mountain. Only the lowest story of the 
tower is intact. What little of the upper 
stories is visible is destroyed. Cut stones 
from walls and battlements lie scattered 
about the cavern floor. The cavern has 
caved in around the sides of the tower so 
only the front is visible. Darkly stained 
doors stand in the tower's front wall. 
Unrecognizable engravings cover those 
metal doors.

The doors are the only entrance to the tower. 
The doors are unlocked, but difficult to open; 
characters must apply 25 strength points to 
open the doors far enough to enter area 51. 

51. CORRIDOR OF THE 
UNEXPECTED 


This is a long 10-foot-wide majestic corri 
dor Its walls rise 30 feet to an arched ceil 
ing. The walls and the ceiling are streaked 
with soot. The corridor leads north into the 
darkness of the tower. 


The corridor is 40 feet long. Two thieves hide 
in the shadows near the north end of the corri 
dor. When the PCs enter, the thieves try to 
surprise them and attack. If the thieves do not 
surprise the PCs. or are captured, they try to 
bluff their way out. 

Bandits (2): AC 6; Tl; hp 6. 4; MV 40'; #AT

These bandits are wearing leather armor and

These thieves followed the Rahib into the 
temple to the tower. They have not been in 
the tower very long. They went down the west 
corridor where all they found was a burned 
library and some wine. 

One bandit carries 30 sp in a pouch. The 
other tarries 200 gp in a leather back pack and 
a 400-gp gem hidden in the hollow hilt of his 
dagger. Each bandit is carrying a bottle of 
Sour Wine. See area 72 for an explanation of 
the use and effects of drinking this wine. 

52. HALL OF RUBBLE 


This is a tremendous hall, filled with bro 
ken and charred beams and rubble. The 
rubble has been moved to the center of the 
room. Overhead, the ceiling is broken 
through by beams and stones. 


The northernmost 10 feet of this room slopes 
gently downward to the north. Dwarves have 
their normal chance to detect the slope, if they 
look for sloping passages. 

Each turn a character searches the rubble, 
roll ldf>. If the result is a 1 or a 2, the character 
finds one of 10 100-gp gems hidden in the 
rubble. Characters may search as long as they 
wish, but searching is noisy. After 4 turns of 
searching, roll for a random encounter on 
Table 3 every tum until they stop searching. 


53. INNER HALL 


This dark. 30-foot-wide hall has a flat ceil 
ing. Two alcoves are set in the cast wall, 
and two in the west wall. The alcoves are 10 
feet high and 10 feet deep. A plush, red 
velvet curtain hangs across the north end of 
the hall. 


This hall is 50 feet long, and slopes gently 
downward to the north. Dwarves have their 
normal chance to detea the slope. The curtain 
blocks all light from area 54, but is easily 
moved aside. 

54. TOMB OF SOULS 


Most of this room is taken up by a plat 
form. Three steps lead up to the platform. 
A brazier, standing in the middle of the 
platform blazing with bright blue flame, 
illuminates this room. Three stone coffins 
arc arranged in a triangle around the bra 
zier. The largest coffin stands at the front 
of the platform. The coffins are coveted 
with mysterious carvings. At the back of 
the platform, is an ornate cast-iron throne. 
To the left of the throne, a metal stand 
supports a large, ancient, leather-bound 
book. The book is closed, its cracked cover 
held by a metal clasp. A long quill pen lies 
on top of the book. The stand is turned so 
that the book, if opened, faces the throne. 


The coffins are marked A, B, and C on the 
map. Sec encounter areas 54A. 54B. and 54C 
for details about these coffins. The brazier is 
fixed to the floor and cannot be removed. The 
flame bums without heat or smoke and can 
not be extinguished. The coals continue to 
bum after being removed from the brazier, 
each coal lighting an area 10 feet in diameter. 
The throne is a receiving teleport from the 
throne in area 100. Sitting on the throne here 
has no effect. 

The Book of Years 2 nd its quill. Windscribe 
have been waiting here for quite some time. 
They are both intelligent and protected by a 
spell that allows only Lawful charaaers to 
touch them. 

The book, when opened, says, "Receive the 
tale of years!" But the pages of the book arc all 
blank! The book then recites the following 
story. The book does nothing else. 


"Come woodland folk and q&then nean, 
the tale of the wizards keep to heau. 
Whence, long ago in a younqen aqe. 
the Black Opal was held By Clyas the 
maqe. 

"the opal incneased his magical grace. 
But he kept the stone in an open place, 
thnee witches, wishing to heighten 
them power. 

Rained flame and stone upon his iowcr. 

"Clyas mapped each witch in a dnagon s 
eye. 

But without the opal, they did not die 
as Clyas Raced to RCtRieve the stone, 
a ORantte mountain CRushed the mage 
and his home 

"the spell ne en completed, the thRee 
witches wait 

In eteRnal suspension until By some fate 
them souls ace Released upon innocence 
sweet 

then Revenge they will Reap upon all 
that they meet." 


The quill answers up to five yes/no questions 
with an 80% chance of accuracy. Windscribe 
only answers questions for Lawful characters. 
If asked about the tower floorplan, the quill 
flies to the parchment the PCs are mapping on 
and draws a rough map of area 100, and areas 
87, 102, and 105. Windscribe docs not 
include secret doors in its map. 

54A. KARALENA'S CRYPT 


This is the largest of the crypts. It is covered 
with unknown symbols. The lid is sealed to 
the base on all four sides with lead. Each 
lead seal is inscribed with a mysterious 
symbol. 


All PCs attempting to lift the lid of the coffin 
must add their strengths together. Roll 2d20. 
If the PCs' combined strengths total more 
than the result of the dice roll, they break the 
scab and open the lid. 

The skeleton of a woman covered with the

the coffin conceals 1,000 cp, 800 ep, and 500

A woman's skeleton wearing rusting chain 
mail armor and rotting furs lies in the coffin. 
One hand holds a nicked non-magical sword 
across its ribcage. The other hand holds a 
scroll across the sword. The sword cannot be 
removed from the skeleton's hand by the PCs. 
If the scroll is read, the skeleton attacks the PC 
reading the scroll. 


"A second chance is seldom found 
To revenge those beneath the ground. 
On ye this fate I do intone 
That you may feel the strength of bone."

55. OUTER WEST VAULT 


Faded frescos of golden towers and dia 
mond trees cover the walls and ceiling of 
this 30-foot-squarc room. In the center of 
the room sits a 10-foot-square cube of 
stone. A ladder leans against the south end 
of the east wall. 


The floor in this room is level. On the west 
side of the cube is a secret door to area 56. 
Another secret door, at the top of the ladder, 
leads to area 54.

The walls of this 30-foot-squarc room arc 
meticulously clean, A ladder leans against 
the south end of the west wall. A 10-foot- 
square cube sits in the center of the room. 


A gelatinous cube is hiding behind the stone 
cube. It attacks the PCs on sight. There arc 60 
ep, 40 gp. and one 50-gp gem inside the crea 
ture.

59. INNER EAST VAULT 

After the PCs find and open the secret door to 
this vault, they see a dosed chest on the floor 
against the far wall. 

When any character steps on the floor of the 
vault, a secret panel in the ceiling opens and a 
pendulum blade swings down, directly in line 
with the door. Any character standing in the 
vault must roll his dexterity score or less on 
ld20 to avoid being hit by the blade. When it 
hits, the blade causes ld8 points of damage. 
The blade swings once every round that there 
is a character on the floor of the vault. When 
the vault is empty, the blade swings back up 
into the secret compartment and the panel 
closes. 

The locked chest contains: 5,000 cp, 100 
gp. 20 pp, and three bottles of Superb Wine. 
The numbers on the wine labels are a code 
that can help the PCs pass safely through area 
92 (see the champagne label). 

Anyone, monster or character, who drinks 
the Superb Wine falls unconscious for 2 turns. 
After reviving, the character remembers a 
nightmare in which a large black gem was 
hanging in a setting on the end of a chain. 
The character also remembers a sense of dizzi 
ness and being in an empty room with a silver 
arch (area 105). 

Characters who drink this wine remain 
drank for ld4 turns after they awaken. Dur 
ing that time, they attack at -4. Drank char 
acters cannot move quietly.

60. EAST STAIRS 

This long, dark staircase slopes down to the 
north. When any PC steps anywhere on the 
top 10 feet of the stain, the stairs suddenly 
swing flat, forming a slide to area 58. Each PC 
on the stairs must roll his dexterity score or less 
on ld20, with a -4 penalty to the dexterity 
score, to avoid falling. Characters not on the 
stairs arc in no danger. Characters at the bot 
tom may use a rope to climb up the slide if 
someone at the top (who is not on the stairs) 
holds the rope. 

61. WEST CORRIDOR 


This 10-foot-wide arched corridor extends 
cast and west The floors, walls, and 30- 
foot-tall arched ceiling arc all coated with a 
thick layer of black soot. 

The double doors at the west end of the corri 
dor are bronze. All other doors arc wood and

62. EMPTY PRISON CELLS 

These prison cells are 20 feet square. Walls in 
the centers of the cells make them U-shaped. 
Two of the cells have fresh straw bedding and 
unspoiled food inside. The other cells appear 
long unused. The Rahib imprisoned Merisa 
and Sylva in the two cells closest to corridor 61 
before the witches took over their bodies. 
Merisa hid a silver bracelet under the mattress 
in the southernmost cell as a clue for anyone 
trying to rescue her. The name "Merisa" is 
engraved on the inside of the bracelet. 

63. MIRYALA'S CELL 


Piteous weeping comes from within this 
ceil. 


An clvcn maiden, Miryala, is chained to the 
wall with leg irons in the southeast pan of the 
cell. She cowers in fear when the PCs 
approach. She is tired, dizzy, and hungry. She 
currently has no spells.

Miryala's kidnapping was not discovered until 
after the PCs left the elven village. The Rahib 
is keeping her here until she recovers enough 
for Trilcna to take over her body. Trilena 
would prefer someone with a higher charisma 
(such as Rahasia), but doesn't want to wait 
much longer. Miryala knows nothing about 
her captors or the tower. 

64. SPIDER LAIR 


Thick cobwebs cover the walls and ceiling 
of this cell. Within the cobwebs, some 
thing moves slowly. 


A black widow spider in the web attacks any 
one who approaches the web.

The bones and clothing of a dead adventurer 
hang in the web in the northeast corner of the 
room. The adventuret was a woman wearing 
leather armor. There are two daggers and a 
leather pouch on her belt. The pouch contains 
50 gp, 20 pp, and 10 50-gp gems. 

The Rahib eventually throws his unwanted 
prisoners to the spider. The adventurer in the 
web was not a prisoner-just unlucky. 


65. MAGICIAN'S CELL 


As the door opens, you hear a metallic 
clank and something moving in the cell. 


A magician named Merdiz is chained by leg 
irons to the wall in the northwest comer of the 
cell. He casts a sleep spell at the PCs on sight. 
Then he uses his spells, as needed, to defeat 
the PCs.

If Merdiz defeats the PCs. he uses their weap 
ons to break his chains, robs them, and then 
escapes. If the PCs defeat him, Merdiz apolo 
gizes and asks for help. 

Merdiz was exploring the tower when Kare- 
lena and Solorena surprised and captured 
him. Unless the PCs explain otherwise. Mer 
diz thinks that they work for the witches. He 
has not had anything to cat or drink for 3 
days. If asked about the tower, he knows only 
that thctc is a magical book in room 54 that he 
cannot touch. 

The witches were eventually going to feed 
Merdiz to the spider in cell 64. 

66. CONNECTING CORRIDOR 

This is a bare corridor. 20 feet long and 10 feet 
wide. 

67. WEST ILLUSION ROOM 


This is a 20-foot-wide room that extends 
30 feet to the west. Against the west wall, a 
glittering pile of gold and jewels beckons. 


This room is actually only 20 feet square. The 
west wall is an illusion. All characters must 
make a saving throw vs. spells each round they 
look at the wall. Those who fail run recklessly 
into the wall, trying to get at the imagined 
treasure, taking ld4 points of damage from 
the collision. PCs can avoid this trap by not 
looking at the illusion. 

68. EAST ILLUSION ROOM 


A huge red dragon in the room raises its 
head and belches a searing blast of flame at 
you! 


The dragon is only an illusion. All characters 
who see the dragon must make saving throws 
vs. spells. Characters who make their saving 
throws do not believe the illusion and are not 
affected by it. Those who fail their saving 
throws actually believe that they were blasted 
by the flaming breath of a dragon and faint on 
the spot, believing they are dead. 

They revive on their own within ld6 game 
turns. If another character tries to revive 
them, the unconscious characters revive with 
in ld6 rounds. Once a character has been 
"killed" by this illusion, he disbelieves the 
illusion. 

This illusion and the one in area 67 are per 
manent illusions created long ago by Elyas. 
They distracted anyone who sought to enter 
Elyas' laboratory uninvited. 

69- CURTAIN OF LIGHT 


The entire southern wall of this 20-foot- 
square room blazes with red light. 


This room is really 30 feet deep. The southern 
wall is an illusionary curtain of light. Charac 
ters who walk forward through the curtain of 
light sec a blinding flash, then find them 
selves walking back out of the curtain into the 
same place they left. Only characters who walk 
backward through the curtain of light pass 
through to the southern pan of the room and 
area 70. 

70. ELYAS' LABORATORY 


Two rows of tables covered with lab equip 
ment stand in the center of this room. 
Dust covers the ancient glass beakers; the 
brass coils are tarnished with age. Cobwebs 
hang like lace between the cracked jars on 
the shelves. Two alcoves arc in the east 
wall. A woman's hat with a pink feather on 
it hangs on a peg between the alcoves. 


The alcoves are teleporters. The northern 
alcove is the receiving end of the teleporter in 
room 89- Elyas decided to add some variety to 
his teleporter system, and used a flashy hat to 
activate his lab teleporter. If a character puts 
on the hat and enters the southern alcove, the 
character magically appears in the alcove in 
room 90. The hat then reappears on the wall 
peg. The hat is needed to operate the teleport 
er leading to room 90. It has no other magical 
power. 

The ancient contents of the jars crumbled 
into useless dust long ago. The lab equipment 
is also useless.

71. LIBRARY 


The charred remains of a long, elegant 
table run the length of the room north to 
south. Broken bookcases, also burned, 
cover the north, west, and south walk. The 
burned leather covers of books are scat 
tered in the shelves and on the floor. 


If PCs spend 3 turns searching the shelves, 
they find a single page of parchment under a 
scorched book cover. The page itself is 
scorched and stained, but parts of the writing 
are still legible. The text that can be read is: 


"Once the three are snared in the trap 1 
have prepared for them, 1 . . . after this, I 
will take it to the throne and ... the 
destruction shall signal. .. banished for all 
eternity." 


72. MAP ROOM 


The walls of this room arc lined with racks 
holding map cases. This room was not 
touched by the fires that gutted much of 
the rest of this level. An elegant solid 
wooden table stands in the center of the 
room. 


Seventy-five bottles of Sour Wine are hidden 
in various map cases. Each time a character 
opens a map case, secretly roll ld6. If the 
result is a 1 or 2, the character finds one of the 
bottles (see the "grapemash" label). 

The numbers on the labels are a code that 
can help the PCs pass safely through area 94. 

Anyone who drinks the Sour Wine falls 
unconscious for ld6 turns. Upon waking up. 
the drinker remembers a nightmare in which 
three dragons stand in a circle glaring at a 
smaller dragon with only one eye. (These arc 
actually the stone dragon heads in room 100.) 

73. WESTERN STAIRS 

Cobwebs line both sides of this staircase. 
There are more and more webs farther in, but 
this staircase is perfectly safe. 

74. EAST PASSAGE 


This passage extends 20 feet east to a pair 
of carved metal doors. A north-south hall 
way crosses this passage just in front of the 
doors.

75. OBSTRUCTED STAIRWAY 


This fine marble staircase circles upward. 
Great blocks of stone and splintered tim 
bers block its passage to the levels above. 


All the upper levels were gutted during the 
banlc between the wizard Elyas and the three 
witches. The contents and furnishings of the 
upper level were totally destroyed. The debris 
that blocks this stairway is from the upper 
walls. The PCs cannot clear the stairway. 

76. KITCHEN 


A large wooden butcher's block stands in 
the center of the room, a cleaver imbedded 
in its surface. The pleasant smell of good 
food hangs in the air. 


This kitchen is 20 feet wide by 30 feet long. 
Exam i n ation of the cupboards reveals that the 
plates and cups are all clean. The shelves arc 
well stocked with roasted meat, cheeses, 
breads, and fruits-all fresh. There are obvi 
ous signs of recent use. The cleaver can be 
used as a weapon, inflicting ld4 points of 
damage per hit. 

If the PCs spend more than 2 turns in this 
room, one of the witches, Karelena arrives 
with her panther. Karelena and her powers are 
described in the Appendix under New Mon 
sters. She orders her panther to attack, then 
casts a hold portal spell to lock the door 
behind her as she escapes. If the PCs pursue 
her, Karelena uses the blue disk in room 84 to 
escape. Remember that she is using Merisa's 
body.

Shelves line the walls of this 20-foot-squarc

and bottles of all types. The room is full of 
a strange, sickening odor that makes 
breathing difficult. Torch flames dim in 
this room. Tiny red eyes gleam from the 
back of the room. 


This room is full of explosive gas from leaking 
bottles. If the PCs extinguish all fires (except 
lanterns) or keep the door to the room open, 
the gas is not dangerous. Each turn the PCs 
bum an open flame and keep the door closed, 
there is a chance that the gas explodes. Each 
turn the PCs burn an open flame in the closed 
room, roll ld6. If the result is 1, the gas 
explodes. Everyone inside the room suffers 
2d6 points of damage from the blast. Charac 
ters who make successful saving throws vs. 
death only suffer half damage. 

The gleaming red eyes belong to a pack of 
giant rats. The rats attack anyone who enters 
this room.

There is a musty smell in the air. 

This room has been unused for a long time. 
There is nothing here of interest. 

79. BLASTED ROOM 


A hole large enough for a man to pass 
through has been blasted through the 
northernmost pan of the east wall. All the 
walls are scorched and pitted, as from a 
massive explosion. 


The hole in the wall leads to the stain, area

through here. 

80. ORCS' ROOM 


Torches in sconces illuminate this 20-foot- 
square room. Huddled in the southeast 
comer of the room, five dark, hunched fig 
ure: argue among themselves. At the 
nonheast comer of the room lies an open 
stone box. 


The dark, hunched figures are ores. Their 
argument is so loud and intense that they are 
surprised on a roll of 1-4 on ld6.

description in room 82 for the use of this wine 
and die effects of drinking it. 

81. EASTERN STAIRS 


The southern flight of stairs is covered with 
rubble, though it is passable. The comer 
wall collapsed here. It is possible to climb 
the nibble into a hole in the wall. 


The hole leads to area 79. Characters will have 
no trouble passing through here. 


82. WINE CELLAR 


This small room is damp and cool. Racks 
filled with wine botdes line the north and 
south walls. 


There are 125 botdes of Good Wine here (see 
the "crush" label). 



Any character who drinks this Good Wine 
falls unconscious for 1 or 2 rums. Upon reviv 
ing. the character remembers a vision of a 
stone obelisk demanding the answer to a 
question. The character feels as if the answer is 
known, but he cannot remember it. 

After reviving, the character is drunk and 
clumsy for ld4 turns, making all attacks at - 
2. Make a random encounter check every turn 
due to the noise drunk characters make. 

The numbers on the label are a code that 
can help the PCs pass safely through the west 
ern teleport maze, area 93. 


83. UPPER HALL OF STATUES 


Two alcoves are cut into both sides of this 
10-foot-wide hall. Several shadowy figures 
stand silendy in each alcove. 


This hall is 50 feet long. At each end of the 
corridor stand pairs of bronze doors, carved 
with delicate designs. 

Each alcove contains one or two life-sized 
pladnum statues of adventurers: humans, 
dwarves, elves, and halflings. All of them are 
posed in running positions, their hands and 
arms outstretched Broad smiles cover their 
faces. The sculpting is very skillful, with 
extremely life-like detail work on each statue. 
The statues are surprisingly light; they weigh 
about as much as an average person. The plat 
inum is only a surface layer, as each of the 
statues is composed of layers of different 
metals: pladnum. gold, electrum. silver, and 
copper, with most of the metal being copper. 
Each statue is worth 2d6 x 20 gp. 

These statues are all convened thieves and 
adventurers who stepped through the magical 
transmuters in room 87. When the witches arc 
destroyed, these adventurers change from 
statues back to normal. 

84. WELL OF WHISPERS 


This is a 30-foot-diamcter circular room. 
Its domed ceiling is 30 feet overhead. The 
entrance to this room is a pair of bronze 
doors in the west wall. A 10-foot-diamctcr 
well drops down into darkness from the 
center of the room. Stone statues stand to 
the north, south, and east of the well. Soft 
moans whisper through the room. 

On the wall between the eastern statue 
and the northern statue is carved the single 
word "Pah." The word "Nwad" is carved 
on the wall between the the eastern statue 
and the southern statue. 


Natural air movements over the statues' 
mouths make the moaning sounds. The well 
is 1,000 feet deep. It is the shaft of a magical 
elevator that connects this level and the lower 
level of Elyas' tower. At the bottom of the 
shaft, in room 85. a glowing blue disc, 2 feet 
in diameter, rests on an ornate stone pedestal. 
The words "Pah" and "Nwad" carved in the 
walls of rooms 84 and 85 activate the elevator. 

When the word "Pah" is spoken, the disc ris 
es from the pedestal in room 85 to the top of the 
well-shaft in room 84. As it nears the top, it 
slows down and gendy floats to a stop. When 
the word "Nwad" is spoken, the disc descends 
gendy and comes to rest atop the pedestal in 
room 85. The disc is cool to the touch and easily 
supports 20,000 coin weight. Passengers are in 
no danger of falling off the disc. The disc cannot 
be removed from the shaft.

Buried deep under ground, this level housed 
the wizard s treasury. This level was the most 
secure pan of his tower. It was to this place 
that Elyas the Wizard lured the three witches, 
and here that he trapped them. 

In this level, check for random encounters 
every third game turn. Roll ld6. A result of 6 
means the PCs encounter something. When 
an encounter occurs, roll ldl2 and use the 
resulting encounter on Table 3. 

85. BOTTOM OF THE WELL 

If the PCs enter this room from area 84. use 
the first boxed description. If the PCs enter 
this room from area 86, use the second boxed 
description. 


The blue disc comes to rest atop an ornate 
carved pedestal in the center of a 30-foot- 
diameter room. This room is identical to 
the room above; the three statues and the 
bronze doors are copies of the ones in that 
room. The word "Pah" is carved in the 
wall between the east and north statues. 
The word ''Nwad'' is carved in the wall 
between che south and east statues. 


In the center of this 30-foot-diameter room 
stands a short round pedestal covered with 
ornate carvings. A glowing blue disc, 2 feet 
in diameter, lies atop the pedestal. Three 
13-foot-tall statues of men stand around 
the pedestal at the north, south, and east 
sides of the room. They seem to stare at 
you with hollow eyes. Each statue makes 
an eerie moaning sound, as if in pain. On 
the wall between the eastern statue and the 
northern statue is carved the single word 
"Pah." The word "Nwad" is carved 
between che eastern statue and the south 
ern statue. A 10-foot-diameter shaft rises 
from the domed ceiling, directly above the 
pedestal and the glowing disk. The shaft 
extends upward as far as you can see. 


Natural a:r movements over the statues' 
mouths cause the moaning sounds. The disk is 
an elevator that moves up and down in the 
shaft. The shaft rises 1.000 feet to room 84. 
Thieves can attempt to climb the shaft. See 
area 84 for an explanation of how the elevator 
works. 


86. LOWER HALL OF STATUES 


Three alcoves are cut into each side of this 
10-foot-wide hall. Several shadowy figures 
stand silently in each alcove. 


This hall is 70 feet long. At each end of the 
corridor stand pairs of bronze doors, carved 
with delicate designs. Each alcove contains 
one or two life-sized platinum statues like 
those in area 83. See area 83 for details about 
these statues. 

87. TRANSMUTER TRAP 


This 20-foot-square room is bathed in soft 
golden light. Glowing 15-foot-widc silver 
arches open through the north and south 
walls. A pair of ornate bronze doors stands 
in the center of the cast wall. A pair of steel 
doors, carved with similar decorations, is 
set in the west wall. 

Elyas' treasure room lies beyond the 
north arch. Light from its glowing domed 
ceiling reflects off the polished marble 
floor, brightening this room. There must 
be thousands of gold pieces in the treasure 
room, spilling from ornate chests! 

The room through the south arch is 
identical to the treasure room, but it is 
empty. 


If any characters passes through cither of the 
arches, a burst of light flashes in the archway 
and they turn into platinum statues just like 
the statues in areas 83 and 86. Victims do not 
make saving throws. 

The statue remains in the archway for only a 
moment. Then the eastern doors swing open 
by themselves The statue PCs rise up and 
float through the doors into an alcove in area 

86 . 

When the witches are destroyed with the 
Black Opal Eye as explained in area 100, all 
the stames in areas 83 and 86 change back into 
the people they were. You can run those peo 
ple as NPCs. They may or may not be friendly 
to the PCs. If you choose not to run them as 
NPCs, assume that they are so shaken by their 
experience that they leave the tower immedi 
ately. 

The Black Opal Eye is hanging from the 
center of the the domed ceiling in the room to 
the south, area 105. However, it is not visible 
from area 87 because the archway between the 
rooms is much lower than the ceiling in area 
105. 


88. CORRIDOR 


This dark corridor is 30 feet long. A pair of 
steel doors are in the east end, and a pair of 
bronze doors are in the west end. The 
north and south walls each contain a single 
wooden door, reinforced with iron bands. 
Those doors arc directly across from one 
another. 


89. KARELENA'S BEDROOM 


This is an extravagantly furnished bed 
room. A gilt framed bed stands in the mid 
dle of the room. Tapestries hang on all four 
walls. A large wardrobe stands in the 
southwest comer. A vanity and mirror sit 
next to the wardrobe. Six small jars and a 
large glass vial lie on top of the vanity. An 
iron gate is set in the north end of the west 
wall. The gate leads to an empty 10-foot- 
square alcove. A 1-foot-long lever is 
attached to the wall near the gate. A wom 
an's wide-brimmed feathered hat hangs on 
a peg near the lever. 


The alcove is a teleporter to Elyas' laboratory. 
Anyone who puts on the hat and steps into the 
alcove appears in the northern alcove in room 
70. The hat reappears on the peg here. The 
hat has no other magical power. 

The lever raises and lowers the iron gate. 
The lever is currently down. The lever cannot 
be seen or reached by anyone in the alcove. 
Karelena keeps the gate lowered when she is 
in the room or when she is gone and will not 
be using the teleporter for a while. 

The tapestries, clothes, and jars have no real 
value, but the vial contains a magical per 
fume. The charisma of any female character 
who uses the perfume increases to 18 for ld6 
turns. The perfume has no other effects. 

90. SOLORENA'S BEDROOM 

The door to this room from area 88 is locked. 


The walls and floor of this room are cov 
ered with rare and expensive carpets. Pil 
lows and cushions he scattered around the 
room. In the center of the room is a large 
carpet with a phoenix embroidered on it. 
A large pile of pillows sits in the southwest 
comer of the room. An arch in the west 
wall leads to a 10-foot-squarc alcove. Near 
the alcove, a 1-foot-long lever projects 
from the wall. 


91 









RAHASIA 


Solorcna is asleep on the pile of pillows. 
Remember that she is using the body of Sylva, 
a willowy, golden-haired elf maiden. 
Solorcna's powers are described in the Appen 
dix under New Monsters.

Solorcna is carrying a levitate scroll, hidden in

If the PCs wake her. Solorcna tries to escape 
through the secret door in the south wall. 
That door is hidden behind a carpet and is 
locked, but Solorcna has its key. If she escapes, 
she goes to area 105 to guard the Black Opal 
Eye. 

If she cannot escape, she pretends to be a 
prisoner. If the PCs attack her, she fights back 
and mentally summons her pet, an intelligent 
black panther. The panther arrives ldlO 
rounds later to defend her.

The carpet with the phoenix design on it is of 
very high quality and is worth 40 gp. It 
weights 300 coin weight. 

The alcove is a receiving area from the tele 
porter in Elyas' Laboratory, area 70. The lever 
controls an iron gate over the alcove. The lever 
and the gate are up. 

91. WINE TASTER 


This room is 30 feet square. There is a pair 
of bronze doors in the east wall. Lowered 
steel portcullises block stairways leading 
down from the centers of the north, south, 
and west walls. 

A huge statue of a tremendously fat 
man sits cross-legged in the center of the 
room. The statue's chubby hands rest 
upon its huge thighs. The statue's open 
mouth gapes at the ceiling in a permanent 
smile. An engraved plaque is attached to 
the base of the statue. It reads: "I judge by 
taste". 


Each portcullis leads to one of three mazes, 
area 92, 93, or 94. The statue is a magical wine 
taster. Whenever wine is poured into its 
mouth, it opens one of the portcullises. The 


portcullis that is opened depends upon the 
quality of the wine poured into the statue. 
The better the wine floured into the taster, the 
shorter and safer the maze. 

Each type of wine found in the tower has a 
serial number printed at the bottom of the 
label. The last letter of that number indicates 
which portcullis is opened. Thus, "Cham 
pagne du le Stomp" (last letter N) opens the 
portcullis in the north wall. "Red Dragon 
Crush" (last letter W) opens the west portcul 
lis. "Grapemash" (last letter S) opens the 
south portcullis. Any wine not found in the 
tower is always judged as the inferior "Grape 
mash." 

92-94. TELEPORT MAZES 

Areas 92, 93. and 94 arc magical teleport maz 
es. Passing through any one of these mazes is 
the only way to get to areas 96-103. All three 
mazes work the same way, but maze 92 is 
shorter than maze 93. which is shorter than 
maze 94. These mazes are shaded on map 6. 

Each lettered area in the mazes is a 10-foot- 
square room surrounded by four 5-foot- 
square alcoves. Open archways lead to the 
alcoves. A number is carved into the floor in 
each archway. The alcoves are numbered 1 
through 4. The starting areas, marked A, only 
lead to three alcoves, numbered 1 through 3. 

The alcoves are magical teleports. Anything 
that passes through the archways is instantly 
teleported away. Only one archway in each 
room leads to the next pan of the maze, and 
eventually out of the maze. The other arch 
ways lead to area 95, the arena. 

If the PCs step through the correct combi 
nation of archways, they never have to fight 
the monsters in room 95. The combinations 
are written on the wine bottles found in the 
tower. Each serial number is the safe sequence 
of archways for one of the mazes. Those 
sequences follow: 

92. North Maze (Safe combination: 3132) 

Archway #3 at 92A leads to 92B 
Archway #1 at 92B leads to 92C 
Archway #3 at 92C leads to 92D 
Archway 12 at 92D leads to room 96. north 

alcove. 

93. West Maze (Safe combination: 331422) 

Archway #3 at 93A leads to 93B 
Archway #3 at 93B leads to 93C 
Archway #1 at 93C leads to 93D 
Archway #4 at 93D leads to 93E 
Archway #2 at 93E leads to 93F 


Archway 92 at 93F leads to room 96, middle 
alcove. 

94. South Maze (Safe combination: 
14231241) 

Archway # 1 at 94A leads to 94B 
Archway #4 at 94B leads to 94C 
Archway #2 at 94C leads to 94D 
Archway #3 at 94D leads to 94E 
Archway # 1 at 94E leads to 94F 
Archway #2 at 94F leads to 94G 
Archway #4 at 94G leads to 94 H 
Archway #1 at 94H leads to room 96, south 
alcove. 

When the PCs enter 92A, 93A, or 94A, use 
the following boxed description. 


A short flight of stairs leads down to a 10- 
foot-squarc room. Three archways open 
from the room into 5-foot-square alcoves. 
A number is carved into the floor in the 
center of each archway. The archways are 
numbered 1, 2. and 3. The alcoves arc 
empty and have no visible exits. 


When the PCs enter any other lettered room 
in areas 92, 93. or 94. use the following boxed 
text. 


You suddenly appear in a 10-foot-squarc 
stone room. Open archways lead to four 5- 
foot-square alcoves. Each archway is 
marked with a number carved in the floor. 
The alcoves are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4. 
The alcoves arc empty and contain no visi 
ble exits. 


The Arena 

Use Map 7 for area 95. 

95. ARENA 


In a flash of white light, you appear on a 
platform on one side of a large, circular 
arena. Another platform, 60 feet away, ris 
es from the area's soft dirt floor. A smooth 
15-foot-tall wall surrounds the area. 
Behind that wall, rows of empty stone 
benches watch over the area. 


The PCs appear on the southern platform. As 
soon as any PC climbs onto the opposite plat 
form, that PC is teleported to area 91. The 
portcullis the PC entered the maze through 
remains open.

When the PCs appear in this arena, mon 
sters also appear to fight the PCs and keep 
them from reaching the north platform. The 
type and number of monsters that appear 
depends upon where the PCs stepped through 
the wrong archway. Use Table 4 to determine 
the monsters that appear in the arena. The 
monsters disappear when they or their oppo 
nents are defeated. 

The Inner Sanctum 

Use Map 8 for areas 96-100. 

96. OUTER TEMPLE 


You suddenly appear inside a 10-foot- 
squarc alcove. An archway in the west wall 
opens into a 30-foot-squarc room. 

Two otner identical alcoves are also set 
into the cast wall of the large room. Gold 
en doors stand in the centers of the north, 
south, and west walls. In the center of the 
room, a 15-foot-tall stone obelisk rests on a 
short, stone pedestal. There are no mark 
ings on either the obelisk or the pedestal. 
The high domed ceiling is covered with a 
fresco of a night sky. Many constellations 
arc marked on the fresco. 


The alcoves are receiving points from the final 
teleports in the teleport mazes, area 92, 93. 
and 94. 

When any question is asked in this room, 
the obelisk speaks. Its deep, hollow voice fills 
the room, saying, "answer me and I'll answer 
thee in truth, if but to questions three; What 
is your name?" 

If the character who asked the question 
replies truthfully, the obelisk asks, "what is 
your quest?" 


If the same character gives a reasonably 
accurate explanation of the PCs' quest, the 
obelisk asks, "do you know the first name of 
the last creature you killed?" The true answer 
to this question is almost always "No." Once 


The obelisk also knows the names of the three 
temples, "Earth," "Wind," and "Fire,' but 
only discloses them if asked about them 
directly. 

If the Black Opal Eye is brought into this 
room, the point of the obelisk begins to glow. 
There is a small depression at the top of the 
obelisk where the Black Opal Eye can be 
placed. Once the gem is placed there, a dim 
spark appears within the gem, after which the 
obelisk point ceases to glow. The gem is then 
ready to be placed in the Dragon Throne in 
room 100. 


the character passes this test, the obelisk 
answers three, and only three, questions that 
character asks it. 

If asked how they can complete their quest, 
the obelisk tells them: 


97. TEMPLE OF FIRE 


This room's ceiling arches 50 feet above the 
stone floor. The ceiling and walls are cov 
ered with frescos depicting raging flames 
and firestorms. At the west end of the 
room an altar stands atop a platform. 
Behind the altar, the life-size shape of a 
human right hand is engraved into the 
wall. 


"Beyond the thuee temples of the elements, 
the Black dRaqons eye waits fop thee, 
find its secnet thRouqh neaRBy maqical ways 
that have waited fop many lone; yeans. 

Bewane the tnicks of old eiyas. 

And Retunn hene with the Black opal eye, to qive it powen. 
then, set it in its place and Behold 
the end of qneat sadness; the Beqinnmq of life: 
the destRuction of evil and the end of stRife. ' 


93 








RAHASIA 


When any PC places his right hand into the 
engraving, a deep, hollow voice speaks, 
"Answer me and I'll answer thee. By what 
name call ye these temples three?" 

The correct answer is, "Earth, Wind, and 
Fire" If this answer, or one with the same 
meaning (such as "Earth, Air, and Flame") is 
spoken, the secret door behind the hand 
silently opens. 

If a wrong answer is given, a column of fire 
bursts from the ceiling, striking the PC whose 
hand is in the engraving. This flame causes 
2d4 points of damage .but only half damage if 
the character makes a successful saving throw 
vs. spells. 

The flame strikes each time a PC answers 
the question incorrectly. Answering the ques 
tion correctly is the only way to open the secret 
door. 

98. TEMPLE OF WIND 


This room's arched ceiling is 50 feet high. 
The walls and ceiling arc covered with fres 
cos depicting racing clouds and trees bent 
over under the force of a hurricane. At the 
west end of the room an altar stands atop a 
platform. Behind the altar, a life-size 
shape of a human right hand is engraved in 
the wall. 


When any PC places his right hand into the 
engraving, a deep, hollow voice speaks. 
"Answer me and I'll answer thee. By what 
name call ye these temples three?" 

The correct answer is, "Earth, Wind, and 
Fire," If this answer, or one with the same 
meaning (such as "Ground, Air, and Flame") 
is spoken, the secret door behind the hand 
silently opens. 

If a wrong answer is given, a tornado forms 
in this room. The tornado causes ld4 points of 
damage to everyone in the room during the 
round after the wrong answer. The tornado 
inflicts ld8 points the next round, and gives 
everyone ld4 points of damage in the third 
round. After the third round, the tornado dis 
appears. Each round, characters who make a 
successful saving throw vs. spells only take half 
damage. 

The tornado forms every time a wrong 
answer is given. Answering the question cor 
rectly is the only way to open the secret door. 

99- TEMPLE OF EARTH 


This room is 50 feet tall. Its arched ceiling 
and walls arc covered with frescos of great 


mountains, canyons, and other rock for 
mations. At the front of the room an altar 
stands atop a platform. Behind the altar, 
the stone wall is shattered and fallen in. 


If the PCs did not encounter Karrlena in room 
27, or if she escaped from them there, she is here 
with a panther. She stands at the altar with her 
back to the door. When she hears the PCs enter, 
she orders the panther to attack. Then she tries 
to escape. Remember she is using Merisa's body. 
A complete description of Karelena is in the 
Appendix under New Monsters.

There is a small passageway in the rubble 
behind the altar that halflings or dwarves can 
crawl through. The PCs can open a passage 
large enough for all the PCs. if they clear the 
rubble for ld6 turns. However, clearing the 
rocks makes a great deal of noise. Check for a 
random encounter every turn the PCs spend 
enlarging the passage. 

100. INNER SANCTUM 


This circular room is 30 feet in diameter. Its 
domed ceiling is 30 feet above the floor. 
Three 10-foot-wide alcoves are set into the 
north, west, and south walls. Three 20-foot- 
tall stone statues stand in front of the alcoves 
around a smaller statue in the center of the 
room. All the statues are carved dragon heads 
on long necks. Gems in the right eyes of the 
southern and northern statues glow with dim 
blue light. The gem in the right eye of the 
western statue glows with a pulsing, bright 
red light. The impression of a hand is carved 
in the neck of each large dragon, within 
reach of normal humans. 

The neck of the smaller center statue is 
hollowed out to form a niche. Within this 
niche sits an iron throne. 

A black stone is set in the smaller statue's 
left eye socket. The right eye socket is empty. 


Every female character who enters this room 
with a charisma of 15 or more must make a 


saving throw vs. spells. The first character who 
fails her saving throw rushes to the western 
statue and places her hand in the carving on 
the statue's neck. Other characters may try to 
stop her if they react quickly. 

As her fingers touch the carving, she and 
the statue are bathed in red light and she falls 
unconscious. After a few seconds she revives, 
apparently unhurt. The gem then glows blue. 
That character's spirit is now imprisoned with 
in the gem and her body is inhabited by the 
spirit of the witch Trilena. 

Trilena pretends to be the character whose 
body she is using Once Trilena is free, all the 
witches' power increases (sec New Monsters). 

Any male character or any female character 
with charisma of less than 15 who places a 
hand in the impression in the western statue 
hears a mocking female voice say: "Fool! 
Think ye that yout feeble wits and strength 
can overcome my powers?" Then a small 
lightning bolt streaks down from the glowing 
eye. giving the character 2d4 points of dam 
age. 

Any PC who touches the hand carving in 
the northern statue instantly communicates 
tclcpathically with the imprisoned elf. Merisa. 
Any PC who touches the hand carving in the 
southern statue communicates tclcpathically 
with Sylva. In both cases, the PC hears faint 
cries for help and feels the pain and sadness of 
the trapped spirit. 

If Solorcna's hand is forced into the carving 
in the southern statue, she becomes trapped 
in the statue again and Sylva is set free. If 
Karelena's hand is forced into the carving in 
the northern statue, she becomes trapped and 
Merisa is freed. If the witches are imprisoned 
in the statues, the color of the eye gems 
changes from blue to red. 

When the Black Opal Eye is purified by the 
obelisk in room 96, and inserted in the right 
eye socket of the small dragon, all three witch 
es are destroyed, no matter where they are. 
The trapped spirits of Sylva and Merisa and 
any spirit trapped by Trilena (see above) arc 
freed. In a flash of blue light, their bodies are 
restored to full health, even if they were killed 
while the witches were in them. 

Anyone who steps into the northern alcove

Anyone who enters the southern alcove is tele 
ported to the platform in room 104. The west 
ern alcove is a receiving point from the 
teleporters in rooms 103 and 106. 

The iron throne looks exactly like the

101. NORTH TREASURY 
ENTRANCE 


This is a 20-foot-squarc room. A semi 
circular platform stands against the wall 
opposite a pair of steel double doors. The 
doors are closed. 


The doors open easily to room 102. The plat

102. NORTH TREASURY 


This room is a 40-foot-widc octagon. The 
entire room is bathed in bright golden 
light from the glowing ceiling, 50 feet 
overhead. Ornate carvings cover the ceil 
ing. Both the cast and west walls have a 
pair of steel doors in them. Both pairs of 
doors are closed. Set in the south wall is a 
glowing silver arch. 20 feet wide. Some 
words in an ancient script are carved above 
the arch. Large treasure chests are scattered 
across the highly polished floor. Some of 
them arc open and full of coins! 


Anyone who passes through the glowing arch 
way turns into a platinum statue. Sec the 
explanation of room 87 for details about the 
archway and its effects. 

The treasure chests contain 4,000 cp. 3,000 
sp. 1,500 ep. 5.000 gp, 500 pp. 3 100-gp 
gems, and 10 50-gp gems, as well as a potion

and levitate. 

PCs have a 40% chance to read the ancient 
script as: 


"Once the portal is crossed. 
Make no mistake. 

A pan of my treasury you will make." 


103. NORTH TREASURY EXIT 


This room is 20 feet square. Ornate steel 
doors in the west wall face a semi-circular 
platform against the east wall. 

Anyone who stands upon the platform is 
instantly teleponed to the western alcove in 
room 100. 


104. SOUTH TREASURY 
ENTRANCE 


This is a 20-foot-square room. A semi 
circular platform stands against the wall 
opposite a pair of steel double doors. The 
doors arc closed. 


The doors open easily to room 105. The plat 
form is a receiving telepon from the southern 
alcove telepon in room 100. Standing on the 
platform here has no effect. 

105. SOUTH TREASURY 


This room is an octagon, 40 feet across. 
Both the cast and west walls have a pair of 
steel doors in them. Both pairs of doors arc 
closed. A glowing silver arch, 20 feet wide, 
is set in the south wall. Some words in an 
ancient script are carved above the arch. 
The entire room is lit by bright golden 
light from the ceiling, 50 feet overhead. 
The ceiling is covered with decorative carv 
ings. A large gem in a setting hangs from 
the end of a chain suspended from the cen 
ter of the ceiling. 


The words are the same as in room 102. The 
gem is the Black Opal Eye. It is hanging in a 
setting ar the end of a 10-foot-long chain, 40 
feet above the floor (which is why it is not visi 
ble from area 87). 

There are many ways the PCs can reach the 
opal. If they use any of the following three 
methods, they automatically succeed. You 
must decide if any other method they use 
works. First, a thief can safely climb the walls 
and go across the ceiling, using ropes to 
anchor himself to the carvings. The carvings 
are solid enough to suppon a character's 
weight. Second, if the PCs throw any kind of 
grappling hook it will snag on one of the carv 
ings in the ceiling. Then they can climb a rope 
from the grappling hook to the gem. Third, a 
magic-user can cast a levitate spell to rise to 
the opal. Once a PC reaches the opal, it is easi 
ly pried out of its setting. 

Anyone who passes through the glowing 
archway turns into a platinum statue. Sec the 
explanation for room 87 for details about the 
archway and its effects. 


106. SOUTH TREASURY EXIT 


This room is 20 feet square. Against the 
cast wall is a large semi-circular platform. 
A pair of steel doors is in the west wall. The 
doors are closed. 


Anyone who steps upon the platform instant 
ly teleports to the western alcove in room 100. 

Aftermath 

The adventure ends when the player charac 
ters have rescued Hasan, recovered the trea 
sure. captured or driven off the Rahib, and 
banished the witch sisters. Although the char 
acters arc expected to turn over Rahasia's trea 
sure, they may keep Elyas' hoard and 
anything else they find. If the adventure suc 
ceeds, Rahasia and Hasan will be wed amidst 
much celebration and the characters will be 
treated as honored guests. If many elves have 
been slain, the celebration will be much sub 
dued and the feelings towards the player char 
acters will be mixed. The characters can fulfill 
their word to Sindar by delivering Mcrisa's 
package to Rahasia.

APPENDIX 


NEW MAGICAL ITEMS 


RAH ASIA'S PENDANT 

Generations ago, the mage Elyas created a tal 
isman of power over evil magic. He gave it to 
the elves, who passed it from generation to 
generation until it came to Rahasia's father 

The talisman is made of two parts, a golden 
pendant and a black jade ring. A black jade 
stone is set in the pendent, which is worth 
1.300 gp alone. There is a flat golden space 
with an uneven circular indentation the size of 
a ring on the back of the pendant. Also, these 
verses arc inscribed on the back of the pen 
dant 

stone of poweR/stone of BRiqht 
qivinq men/theiR Rays of liqht 
foRces OARk/wiLL thou make small 
weak'ninq men/of niqht's OaRk call 
putxinq Rinq/into the Back 
venqeance qive/to those m Black 

The ting exactly matches the impression in the 
pendant. When the ring is pressed into the 
impression, there is a bright flash of light as 
the two become the talisman. 

Wnen the ring and pendant are joined, the 
writing on the back of the pendant changes to 
the single word "RAHASIA." When the 
holder of the talisman says "RAHASIA." an 
invisible 30-foot-radius circle of power is cre 
ated. No evil magic works in this circle, 
including the Rahib's curse. Spells cast by evil 
beings in the circle automatically fail, but 
existing spell effects and permanent items 
used by evil beings still work outside the cir- 
de. The circle does not affect the bone golem 
or the water wdrd. The cirdc of power lasts 10 
rounds. It moves with the talisman. The talis 
man will work only three times, after which 
the ring and pendant separate and become 
non-magical. 


THE BLACK OPAL EYE 

The Black Opal Eye is a stone of great magical 
power, usable only by those who know its 
secret. The three witches draw power from it 
and will increase in power if all of them are 
freed. They do not need to possess the opal, 
but only need to know where it is in order to 
use it. The witches will not be able to use 2nd 
and 3rd level spells if the stone is stolen and 
they do not know where it is. 

Elyas planned to use the Black Opal Eye's 
power to destroy the witches, but was killed 
before he could do so. To destroy the witches, 
the PCs must place the opal on the obelisk in 
room 96, then place the gem in the Dragon 
Throne in room 100. If they do this, the fol 
lowing happens: 

1. The spirits of the three witches arc perma 
nently locked within the gem eyes of the 
larger dragons. 

2. The spirits of the witches' victims return 
to their original bodies. 

3. The three large dragon heads crumble 
away, and the eyes are banished forever to 
an unknown dimension. 

4. All the adventurers transformed into 
platinum statues are restored to normal. 
The PCs may not have rescued all the 
prisoners (the elves Hasan. Merisa, Sylva, 
and Miryala; the magician Merdiz; and 
the fighter Baik Telor). The adventurers 
who were platinum statues rescue anyone 
the PCs don't. 

5. The Black Opal Eye shatters into dust. 

6. If the Rahib is still alive and free, he flees 
from the elven forest forever. 


After delivering Stndar's package in the elven 
village the party returns to the Duke's road 
and continues north. An uneventful journey 
brings them to Sclenica. As the western end of 
a trade route that crosses the Altan Tepe 
Mountains and the vast sandy Alasiyan Desert 
to the cast, its crowded streets have vendors 
selling many wares that arc rarely seen in the 
Grand Duchy. The streets are strange and con 
fusing, and in trying to follow Sindar's direc 
tions the parry becomes hopelessly lost. 

Finally, they manage to discover Arnulfs 
dwelling, an expensive mansion in the Mer 
chants' Quarter A new problem arises. They 
arc met at the door by Praxes, a snobbish ser 
vant of Amulf. He looks at the dusty and 
travel-stained adventurers and is convinced 
they could not possibly have anything to give 
his master. Encourage the players to role-play 
their attempts to get Arnulfs whereabouts 
from the haughry servant. Among things that 
will work: a) a bribe of 100 gp or more; b) tak 
ing rooms somewhere, cleaning up, and pre 
senting themselves in new and expensive 
clothing; or c) any device that impresses you as 
being suitably clever. 

Trying to get the information elsewhere will 
reveal only that he "left town" secretly, as he 
often does and that he is probably off trading 
somewhere. Asking for informarion about 
Praxes will reveal that he is vain, greedy, and 
treats his underlings badly, but is also very 
efficient and loyal to Amulf Armed with this 
information, the party should succeed. 

Praxes will reveal that Amulf left on a trad 
ing expedition to the city of Ylarum with a 
slow-moving caravan the day before the party 
arrived. They might be able to catch him if 
their horses are fast enough. If the parry 
doesn't have them. Praxes will sell them fast 
desen ponies for 300 gp each (he can be bar 
gained down to 100 gp each). 

If the party gives up and returns to the 
Grand Duchy, they will not find Sindar again. 
When they finally reach Specularum, they 
will meet him and be accused of robbery. They 
will be acquitted, but will have to pay coun 
costs of about 10% of their wealth 

Once mounted for desert travel, the charac 
ters have no trouble catching Amulf s caravan. 
Amulf is delighted with Sindar's gift, a magi 
cal jeweled songbird, and invites the party to 
accompany him to the exotic capital of Yla- 
ruam. He offers to hire them as caravan guards 
at 100 gp each plus expenses, and give them a 
healthy bonus if the trading is good. 

Whether they accept or not. a day or two 
later they will be caught in a sandstorm, and 
be lost in the desert until they stumble onto 
the Lost City.

General Notes: In its original form, this 
adventure had a fully detailed five-tier pyra 
mid, an outline of a second five tiers, and a 
map to the lost city. The concept was to 
encourage the DM to expand the latter sec 
tions into a full blown campaign. The upper 
pyramid levels were selected for inclusion in 
this collection.

Players' Background 

Days ago, your group of adventurers joined a 
desert caravan. Halfway across the desert, a 
terrible sandstorm struck, separating your par 
ty from the rest of the caravan. When the 
storm died down, you found you were alone. 
The caravan was nowhere in sight. The desert 
was unrecognizable, as the dunes had been 
blown into new patterns. You were lost. 

You headed east, the same way the caravan 
was headed before the storm. Days passed. 
Your mounts died and you soon drank the last 
of your water. The end of the desert was not in 
sight. 

The second day after your water ran out, 
you stumbled upon a number of stone blocks 
sticking out of sand dune. Investigation 
showed that the sand covered the remains of a 
tall stone wall. On the other side of the stone 
wall was a ruined city. 

The stone blocks of the city had toppled 
and cracked with the passing of time. Sand 
had covered most of the buildings. The stones 
that remained uncovered had been scoured 
smooth by the blowing sands. 

In the center of the city towered a step- 
pyramid. It had five stcp-Ukc tiers, each 20' 
high. The bottom-most tier was almost com 
pletely covered with sand. On top of the high 
est tier were three 30' tall statues. 

The statue on the left was of a strong, 
bearded man holding a balance in one hand 
and a lightning bolt in the other. The middle 
statue was of a winged child with two snakes 
twined about its body. The child held a wand 
in one hand and a handful of coins in the oth 
er. The statue on the right was of a beautiful 
woman. In her hands she held a sheaf of wheat 
and a sword. 

On the south side of the pyramid, a ramp 
with stairs led from the ground to the top of 
the highest tier. A quick search of the mins 
revealed no source of food or water, so you 
decided to climb the pyramid. In the side of 
the ramp, level with the floor of the top tier, 
you found a secret door.... 

DM's Background 

Centuries ago, Cynidicea was the capital of a 
rich and fertile kingdom. Its people reclaimed 
much land from the desert, especially during 
the reign of King Alexander-the last and 
greatest king of Cynidicea. Upon King Alex 
ander's death, a huge pyramid was raised in 
his honor. This pyramid was the largest and 
most important building in the city. 

The fall of Cynidicea began on the day that 
workers, digging under the great pyramid. 


chanced upon the lair of a strange monster 
called Zargon. Zargon was roughly humanoid 
in shape, though larger than most humans. In 
place of arms and legs it had twelve tentacles. 
Its head was that of a giant lizard, with a large 
black horn in the middle of its forehead. 

Zargon killed most of the workers, then 
began hunting prey at night through the 
streets of Cynidicea. The city guard was not 
able to kill the monster. At last, the city rulers 
began sending criminals from the jails into 
the pyramid for Zargon to feed on. 

In time, a strange cult arose that wor 
shipped the monster as a god. The cult viewed 
the monster's victims as religious sacrifices. 
The worship of the Immortal patrons of Cyn- 
dicea -Gorm. Usamigaras, and Madarua- 
was forsaken in favor of the worship of the 
monster Zargon. Finally, most of the citizens 
of Cynidicea worshipped it. 

The worshippers of Zargon began to look 
for strange pleasures. They sought oblivion in 
rare wines and bizarre drugs. Workers no long 
er repaired the irrigation ditches. Rich land 
turned into desert. The army lost its disci 
pline. People outside the city rebelled, or 
moved away as chaos spread outward from 
Cynidicea. 

Later, barbarian wamors stormed over the 
walls and destroyed the city. The only people 
of Cynidicea who survived its destruction were 
those who had fled underground to the vast 
catacombs under the city. There, led by Priests 
of Zargon, the Cynidiceans tried to rebuild 
the city. 

The surviving people based their new life 
around a huge underground lake fed by chan 
nels cut through solid rock. Built in the reign 
of King Alexander, the lake had been the 
original city's water supply. On its shores, the 
people grew mushrooms and other edible 
fungi. They built houses using stones from 
the ruins above. The new underground city 
was much smaller than the ancient capital, 
but it was safer because it was hidden beneath 
the desert sands. Above, drifting sands cov 
ered the onginal city, and Cynidicea was lost 
in the vastness of the desert. 

The Cynidiceans 

Generation after generation of Cynidiceans 
have lived out their lives underground. 
Though still human, their skin has become 
very pale and their hair is bone-white. The 
Cynidiceans have developed infravision and, 
like goblins, attack with a penalty of -1 to hit 
when fighting in full daylight. 

Every Cynidiccan wears a stylized mask, 
usually of an animal or human face. Some arc

THE LOST CITY 


made of wood, some of paper machc. and 
some of metal. Most Cynidiceans wear fancy 
clothes, flashy jewelry, and carry short swords. 
Some paint their bodies with bright colors. 

The Cynidiceans are a dying race. Each new 
generation is smaller than the last. Most Cyni- 
diccans have forgotten that an outside world 
exists, living most of their lives in weird 
dreams. The times when they seem normal, 
tending their fields and animals, are becom 
ing fewer and fewer as the dreams replace real 
ity. Their unusual costumes and masks only 
strengthen their dream worlds. Typical Cyni- 
diccan encounters are given in the New Mon 
ster section. 

Factions of Cynidicea 

A few Cynidiceans are nearly normal. These 
Cynidiceans arc trying to restore the worship 
of the old Immortals-Gotm, Usamigaras, 
and Madarua. They hope to stop the slow 
death of their society and regain the past glory 
of Cynidicea. 

The Brotherhood of Gorm. Their Immor 
tal, Gorm, rules war, storms, and justice. The 
followers of Gorm are male fighters of Lawful 
alignment. Ail wear golden masks of the face 
of Gotm, a long-haired, bearded man with a 
stern gaze. Each Brother also wears iron chain 
mail over a blue tunic. Under the armor, each 
has a small blue lightning bolt tattooed on his 
right shoulder. The Brothers believe in justice 
tempered by mercy. They worship Gorm on 
the fourth day of each week and considet 
lightning storms to be holy. 

The Magi of Usamigaras. This faction wor 
ships Usamigaras, ruler of healing, messen 
gers, and thieves. They are all Neutral 
magic-users, wearing silver masks of the face 
of Usamigaras, the smiling child. The Magi 
also carry silver daggers and wear rainbow- 
colored robes. 

The right palm of each is marked with small 
silver lines in the shape of a five-pointed star. 
The Magi arc usually friendly toward clerics, 
thieves, elves, and magic-users, but look 
down upon fighters, dwarves, and halflings. 
Usamigaras is worshipped on certain days 
when the heavenly stars and planets are in the 
right patterns. The Magi record the positions 
of the stan and planets so that they will know 
when their holy days are. 

The Warrior Maidens of Madarua. The 
Maidens worship Madarua, ruler of birth, 
death, and the changing seasons. They are 
Neutral female fighters. The Warrior Maidens 
wear bronze masks of Madarua. a beautiful 
woman. They also wear bronze chain mail 
armor over green tunics. Each Maiden has a 


small, sickle-shaped scar on the inside of her 
left wrist. Madarua has a special holy day at 
the beginning of each of the four seasons. 

The three factions do not get along well. 
Each faction is sure that only its members 
know the proper way to restore the lost great 
ness of Cynidicea. Often, when members of 
different factions meet, they argue or fight. It 
is possible for the three factions to cooperate, 
but such cooperation is rare. 

The bickering between the three factions, 
and their attempts to restore sanity to Cynidi- 
cean society, give the DM the chance to add 
character interaction to the adventure. While 
the factions can be played as simple monsters 
with treasure, the DM and players can have a 
lot of fun with the plots and feuding of the 
factions. If this is done, the DM should plan 
in advance what the faction members may say 
or do if the party tries to talk, attack, or wait to 
see what the N'PCs do first. It is important for 
the DM to avoid forcing the action to a pre-set 
conclusion-the actions of the players must be 
able to make a difference. 

If the player characters join one of the fac 
tions. it will be easier for them to get supplies 
and rest between adventures. All the factions 
may accept player characters as members. 

The Brotherhood of Gotm will take male 
fighters, male dwarves, male halflings. and 
male elves as full members. The Magi of 
Usamigaras will take any magic-user, elf, cler 
ic, or chief. The Warrior Maidens will take 
female fighters, female elves, female dwarves, 
and female halflings as full members. Also, 
any character may become a lesser member of 
a faction, if desired. Factions will not do as 
much for lesser members, and a lesser mem 
ber can never become powerful within a fac 
tion. The DM should decide how much a 
faction will do for its members. 

The Priests of Zargon are a fourth faction. 
They are found mainly in areas outside the 
basic adventure. The Priests of Zargon serve 
the evil monster Zargon and control the 
underground city. 

TIERS 1 AND 2 
(Dungeon Level 1) 

The pyramid is made of large, smooth stone 
blocks. The rooms arc made of bare stone 
slabs, except where noted otherwise. Passage 
ceilings arc usually 10' high. Room ceilings 
are 15' high. Most doors will be stone slabs 
that push inward to open. Doors will tend to 
close unless held, jammed, or spiked open. 
Unless otherwise stated, the pyramid will be 
unlit. 


Remember that the characters are out of 
food and water. They must have these supplies 
soon or they will die In your descriptions, 
keep reminding the party that they are hun 
gry, thirsty, and tired. This will help the play 
ers role play. 

Wandering Monsters 

Wandering monsters are encountered on a roll 
of 1 on ld6. Check for wandering monsters 
once every 2 game turns. Roll IdS on the Wui- 
dering Monster lable: Level 1 table for the 
monster encountered, or choose one. 

Giant Locust. Giant locusts are 3' long gray 
grasshoppers. They arc immune to poison and 
yellow mold. If disturbed, giant locusts will 
panic and jump up to 60' in a random direc 
tion (50% chance to jump toward the party.) 
Anyone hit by a jumping locust takes 1-4 
points of damage. Giant locusts may bite for 
1-2 points of damage. They also shriek when 
frightened, having a 20% chance to attract 
wandering monsters. If cornered, a giant 
locust will spit a brown goo up to 10' (any tar 
get is AC 9 for this). A character hit by the goo 
must save vs. Poison or be too sick to do any 
thing for 1 turn. Other characters coming 
within 5' of the victim must save vs. Poison or 
also become violently ill for a rum. The victim 
has this effect until the goo is washed off. 

Cvnidicean. Cynidiceans live underground 
in the Lost City. They are pale-skinned, white- 
haired humans with large eyes and infravis 
ion. Cynidiceans wear masks and brightly 
colored robes. They will be acting out strange 
dreams when encountered (see the DM's 
Background information). A dozen Cynidi- 
cean encounters, usable for all dungeon 
levels, are given under Cynidiceans in the 
monster section. The DM may use these 
encounters or make up his or her own. 

Ferret, Giant. Giant ferrets look like 3' long 
weasels. They hunt giant rats underground. 
Ferrets are highly unpredictable and some 
times attack humans. 

Gnome. These gnomes have traveled 
underground to the Lost City through the 
tunnels and canals that empty into the under 
ground lake that lies near the underground 
city map. 

Goblin. The goblins live in caves across the 
underground lake from the Cynicideans. The 
goblins serve Zargon. If no Cynidiceans vol 
unteer to go to Zargon, the goblins kidnap 
victims to feed the monster. Otherwise, the 
goblins do not usually harm Cynidiceans. 
After all. if the Cynidiceans died out, Zargon 
would start eating goblins!

THE LOST CITY 


KEY TO TIER 1 

STATUE ROOM 

rhc slab of stone that hid the secret 
entrance to the pyramid is now held open 
by the dead body of a hobgoblin. The 
body has a large crossbow bolt sunk deep 
in its chest. The hobgoblin has been dead 
several weeks. 


icre is nothing of interest around the body, 
id all its equipment has been taken. Beyond 
c stone slab is a 10' wide passage, leading 
to the pytamid. The passage floor is covered 
ith dust. Several pain of footprints can be 
en leading inward. In a niche in the wall 
>posite the secret door, the party will see a 
rgc crossbow (la) pointed at them. The 
ossbow is not loaded. The crossbow trap was 
iggered by a hidden pressure plate in the 
x>r just inside the secret door. The hobgob- 
1 stepped on the plate, springing the trap, 
le secret door to the pyramid will swing shut 
rhind the party unless they jam it open. It 
n be forced open normally. 


The highest tier of the pyramid is a single 
40' square room. The room smells old and 
musty. The dust on the floor has been dis 
turbed. though no special details can be 
made out. Three huge bronze cylinders 
reach from the floor to the ceiling in the 
middle of the room. In the center of each 
cylinder, facing you at floor level, is a 
bronze door. Each door has a bronze han 
dle that can be used to pull the door open. 


M Note on Traps: Normally the characters 
on't find traps unless they arc looking for 
icm. Traps that work automatically can be 
roided by taking special precautions. The 
M rolls the dice whenever characters are 
oking for (or thieves are removing) traps, 
lore information on traps can be found in the 
'&D Bask rules. 

ap lb. The door to the room, as usual, will 
ving shut unless held or jammed open. In 
ich comer of the room are small holes that 
lease gas into the room. The gas trap is trig- 
:red by opening the door. The gas is odor- 
ss, tasteless, and invisible. An elf or thief has 
50% chance to hear the hiss of escaping gas. 

The gas will take one round to build up in 
te closed room before doing any damage, 
luring this round the characters will feel a lit- 
e dizzy. Each round after the first, the gas 
oes 1 point of damage. When they start tak 


ing damage, the party will realize it is getting 
hard to breathe. Rags or iron spikes jammed 
into the holes will stop the gas from filling the 
room. If both the room's door and the secret 
door are jammed open, the gas will escape 
without harming the party. 

The bronze cylinders ate actually the hollow 
bases of the statues of the Cvnidicean Immor 
tals on top of the pyramid. The cylinders will 
sound hollow if tapped. The doors into the 
cylinders are also trapped (lc. Id, and lc). 

Trap lc is in the west wall next to the base of 
the left statue (Gorm). Four darts will fire out 
of the wall when the door's handle is pulled. 
The darts can only hit someone standing 
directly in front of the door. Roll to hit as if 
each dan was fired by a 1 HD monster. Each 
dan that hits does 1-3 points of damage. 

Trap Id in the base of the center statue 
(Usamigaras) is harmless. If the party searches 
this area, they will find dried blood in front of 
the cylinder. The trap was triggered by an ear 
lier party. (Normally, two spears would shoot 
out when the door is opened. Each attack 
would be rolled as if a 1 HD monster was 
throwing the spears at characters standing 
directly in front of the door. Each character hit 
would take 1-6 points of damage. The DM 
may have this trap reset if the party leaves and 
comes back.) 

Trap le is a special hinged paving stone in 
front of the base of the right statue (Mada- 
rua). The stone will drop open when the door 
handle is pulled. Anyone standing in front of 
the door will fall to room 6 below and take 1-6 
points of damage. 

The bronze cylinders are hollow. A ladder 
going both up and down will be found inside 
each cylinder. Anyone climbing up a ladder 
will find that it goes up inside one of the 
statues on top of the pyramid. Each statue has 
a special speaking tube which allowed its 
priests to speak the Immortal's will. The char 
acter will also see a number of levers. These 
levers can be used to move parts of the statue 
(arms, head, eyes, and so on). A character 
climbing down any ladder will enter room 6.

2. STORAGE ROOM 

This room contains rotting bales of what 
might be cloth, and dusty crates. The 
room smells like it has been dosed off for a 
long time. 


The room is an old norage room that has long 
been abandoned. The food once in the crates, 
and the clothing once in the bales, is now rot 
ted and worthless. Otherwise, the room is 
empty. 

3. SECRET ROOM 


Inside this room you see seven budlike 
creatures with long beaks like tubes. A 
faint glitter catches yout eye from the cen 
ter of the room as the birdlike creatures fly 
toward you. 


The attacking birdlike creatures arc stirges 
(AC 7: HD 1*; hp 4 each; MV 60'; "AT 1 at 
+ 2; D I-J; Save FI; ML 9; AL N). A flying 
stirge gams a bonus of + 2 to hit due to its 
speed. 

Once a nirge's attack hits, its beak attaches 
to the victim. The stirge sucks blood for an 
automatic 1-3 points of damage every round 
until either the victim or the stirge is dead. 

The glitter comes from four gems lying in a 
pile of dun. The gems are worth 100 gp, 100 
gp, 500 gp. and 1000 gp. The room also has a 
small hole high in the north wall. The stirges 
fly through the hole when they go our hunt 
ing at night. 

4. PRIEST'S QUARTERS 


The room is sparsely furnished with rotting 
furniture. This includes a bed, a desk, a 
chen. a writing table with wooden chair, 
and a wooden holy symbol shaped like a 
lightning bolt. All of the furniture is cov 
ered with a thick layer of dun. On the floor 
lies the body of a dead hobgoblin. The 
body looks several weeks dead. Its left arm 
is swollen and discolored. 


This room was once the quarters of a high 
priest of the Brotherhood of Gorm. The hob 
goblin was killed by a giant bee from room 7. 
His body has a full water bottle and a purse 
with 135 sp and 40 gp in it. Otherwise the 
room is empty. 

5. FIREWORKS STOREROOM 


This room seems drier than the rest of the 
pyramid. In the center of the room are a 
half dozen small crates. Seated on the 
crates arc nearly a dozen I' tall winged 
people. They are talking a strange musical 
language and laughing merrily. 


99 







THE LOST CITY 


These small winged people arc sprites (AC 5; 
HD 1/2; hp 3 each; MV 20', fly 60'; #AT 1 
spell; D special; Save El; ML 7; AL N). There 
arc 10 of them. They will be friendly and chat 
ter merrily if approached in a friendly manner. 
They are interested in everything, but nothing 
holds their attention long. They will not join 
the party, but the DM may use them to hint 
about what lies ahead. If attacked, five sprites 
acting together can cast one curse spell. The 
curse will take the form of a magical practical 
joke (like suddenly making a fighter's armor 
turn into a pile of rust, or gluing a character's 
boots to the floor). The sprites will cast one or 
two curses, then fly away through a 1' x l' 
concealed door high in the northeast wall. If 
pursued, they will try to escape by flying over 
the green slime in room 8. 

The crates contain fireworks packed in saw 
dust. There is only a 1 in 6 chance that a crate 
of fireworks is still usable after all this time. 
Any usable crate of fireworks is worth 100 gp 
resale value. The ancient priests of Cynidicea 
used the fireworks to help fake "miracles." If 
the players decide to keep the fireworks, a usa 
ble crate contains 1-6 charges of flash powder, 
2-8 roman candles, 1-4 skyrockets, and 3-12 
strings of small firecrackers. The DM should 
only allow these firecrackers to make a lot of 
smoke, bright lights, and noise. The firecrack 
ers should not do any damage or cause blind 
ness. 

5a. POTTERY JARS 

These three pottery jars are 4' tall. The first 
contains sand. The others, which used to store 
water, are now dry and empty. The contents of 
the jars were to be used if a fire broke out in 
the fireworks room. 

6. SPECIAL STOREROOM 


A 10' radius circle at the foot of each ladder 
is lit by a glowing. 2' long beetle. Each 
beetle has three glowing spots. 


The three beetles are fire beetles (AC 4; HD 
1 + 2; hp 6 each; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 2-8; Save 
Fl; ML 7; ALN). Each beetle has three glands 
that glow and give off light for a 10' radius. 
The glands will continue to glow for 1-6 days 
after they are removed. The beedes are hun 
gry and will attack if disturbed. 

This room holds spare parts for the machin 
ery inside the statues. There arc also several 
large, covered, clay pots. These pots held oil 
to lubricate the machinery. The oil has almost 
evaporated over the centuries, even through 
though the pots were scaled. The party can 


recover 5 flasks of oil that will burn poorly and 
make thick clouds of smoke if lit. It will take 2 
turns to recover all the oil. There is also a small 
foundry here for fixing broken statue pans. It 
has a forge, an anvil, tongs, hammers, and so 
on. 

7. TREASURE ROOM 


In the center of the room you sec a 10' tall 
cage. In the bonom of the cage is a pile of 
coins and gems. Hanging from the top of 
the cage is a giant beehive. Several large, 1' 
long bees are buzzing around the room. 
The mesh of the cage is wide enough for 
them to fly through. There is also a 1' 
square hole high in the south wall. 


The locked cage holds the treasure of the 
Brotherhood of Gorrn (rooms 11 and 12). The 
treasure is guarded by 5 giant bees (AC 7; HD 
1/2*; hp 2 each; MV 50'; #AT 1; D 1-3 + spe 
cial; Save Fl; ML 9; AL N) flying around the 
room. The giant bees have learned that per 
sons wearing a mask of Gorm arc friendly. 
They will not attack anyone wearing the mask 
of Gorm unless attacked first. 

The giant bees will automatically attack any 
other persons who go into the room. If the bee 
attack is successful, the stung victim must save 
vs. Poison or die. The bee will die after sting 
ing. Even characters who save must take 1 
round to remove the stinger. Otherwise the 
stinger will continue to work its way into the 
victim doing 1 point of damage per round. 

The treasure lying on the bottom of the 
cage is 2000 sp. 500 gp, 2 gems each worth 
100 gp and one piece of jewelry worth 700 gp. 

The bees inside the hive will not attack the 
party unless the hive itself is attacked. Inside 
the hive arc 4 more bees with 1 hit die each 
(4hp), and a 2 hit die queen bee (9 hp). The 
queen, unlike all other giant bees, can sting 
repeatedly without dying. A special kind of 
honey is found inside the beehive. If eaten, 
the honey acts as one half-strength potion of 
healing, curing 1-4 points of damage. All the 
honey in the hive is needed to cure one charac 
ter of 1-4 points of damage. 

8. ABANDONED ROOM 


The entire floor of this room is covered 
with green, oozing slime. Otherwise the 
room appears to be empty. 

The green oozing slime (AC n/a; HD 2*; hp 
9; MV 1'; #AT 1; D special; Save Fl; ML 12; 
AL N). Green slime can only be hurt by fire or 


cold It dissolves wood and metal in 6 rounds. 
If it touches flesh, it will turn the victim to 
green slime in 1-4 rounds after the first 6 
rounds. Green slime can be burned off, but 
this does 1/2 damage to the slime and 1/2 
damage to the character. 

9. ABANDONED PRIEST'S QUARTERS 


The room contains an old bed, writing 
table, chair, and a chest. From the looks of 
the furniture, the quarters have been long 
abandoned. From behind the bed comes 
scuffling sounds. Suddenly you sec the 
head of a large, pale blue lizard with 
orange spots burst suddenly into view. 


The lizard is a Gecko (AC 5; HD 3 + l; hp 15; 
MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-8; Save F2; AL N). It is 
munching on the body of an unfortunate 
Cynidiccan. If the party enters the room with 
out looking up, they will be surprised by a sec 
ond Gecko that drops down from the ceiling 
(hp 12). The mask worn by the Cynidiccan is 
of some birdlike creature. It is inlaid with gold 
and worth 80 gp. 

10. ABANDONED PRIEST S QUARTERS 


This room might once have been the quar 
ters of a cleric, but it looks like it has been 
abandoned for a long time. It contains 
musty, dust-covered furniture; a sleeping 
pallet, a writing desk with a wooden stool, 
a chest, and a wooden holy symbol that 
looks like a balance. 


The room holds nothing valuable. 

11. BROTHERHOOD OF GORM 


The room contains three double bunk 
beds. Five men are seated on the lower 
bunks talking. Each man wears iron chain 
mail over a blue tunic. All wear steel hel 
mets. and each man's face is covered by a 
golden mask. All their masks are the same. 
They show a long-haired, bearded man 
with a stem gaze. 


The five men belong to the Brotherhood of 
Gorm (AC 5; Fl; hp 5 each; MV 20'; #AT 1; D 
1-8; Save Fl; ML 8; AL L). The Brotherhood 
of Gorm controls rooms 11, 12, and 24. 

If the party docs not attack, the men may 
ask them to join the Brotherhood. The DM 
may decide this or roll 2d6. A roll of 9-12 
means the party will be asked to join. A roll of 
6-8 means the party members may join, but 


100 









THE LOST CITY 


will not be asked. A roll of 2-5 means the 
Brothers wili assume the characters arc thieves 
or spies and attack or drive them away. Only 
male fighters, dwarves, halflings. and elves of 
Lawful alignment may become full members, 
but any character may become a lesser mem 
ber. Characters who want to join the Brother 
hood will be taken to room 12. 

If fighting starts, the Brothers of Gorm in 
room 12 will hear the fighting and rush to 
help their fellow Brothers. 

This room contains the Brothers' equip 
ment, including food and water. The only 
treasure is the Brothers' masks, which are 
worth 100 gp each. 

11a. STATUE OF GORM 


At the end of the corridor you see a glitter 
ing statue. The statue appears to be a 
smaller version of the bearded man wield 
ing a lightning boh you saw on top of the 
pyramid. 


The statue may appear at first to be made of 
gold. Actually it is a wooden statue painted 
with golden paint. It is man-sized and firmly 
set into a heavy stone base. This statue of 
Gorm has no gp value. 

12. GRAND MASTER OF THE 
BROTHERHOOD OF GORM 


The room has three double bunk beds 
along the walls. Six men stand around the 
room talking. All wear chain mail armor 
over blue tunics. Each man also wears a 
steel helmet and a golden mask. The 
masks look like a long-haired, bearded 
man with a stem gaze. 


Five of the men are Brothers of Gorm (AC 5; 
FI; hp 5 each; MV 20'; #AT 1; D 1-8; Save Fl; 
ML 8; AL L). The tallest, oldest man is Kana- 
dius, the Grand Master of the Brotherhood of 
Gorm (AC 4; F3; hp 25; #AT 1 ar +1; D 1- 
8 + 1; Save F3; ALL; S 14.1 12, W9. D 12. C 
10, Ch 12). He wears a fancier helmet. He also 
gives all Brothers a morale of 9 when they are 
with him, 

Kanadius is stem-looking but basically 
kindly. He prefers to out-maneuver oppo 
nents, but is brave if fighting is necessary. He 
is somewhat absent-minded with unimport 
ant details but not with major ones. He leads 
his men rather than orders them. Under his 
leadership. morale is high. 

If the party attacks: the Brothers in room 11 
will rush to the aid of their fellow Brothets. 


There is a secret trapdoor behind one of the 
beds in the southeast comer of the room. If 
the parry attacks and is winning. Kanadius 
may try to escape through this door. It leads 
down into the secret chamber next to room 24 
on Tier 3. Unless their morale fails, the Broth 
ers will fight to help Kanadius escape. 

If Kanadius is attacked and escapes, the 
DM may create a special encounter for later in 
the adventure. The encounter would be with 
Kanadius and a dozen Brothers of Gorm who 
try to revenge their fellows. The special 
encounter would replace a wandering monster 
encounter, or it could happen at some place 
the DM chooses. 

This area contains the equipment of the 
Brothers, including food and water. The 
Brothers' masks are worth 100 gp and Kana 
dius' fancy helmet is a helm of telepathy, usa 
ble three times each day. 

If the party does not attack: the Brothets in 
this room may ask them to join (sec room 11). 
This happens if the DM tolls a 9-12 on 2d6. If 
this is the first time the party has met the 
Brothers, the Brothets may become suspicious 
and attack (a 2d6 roll of 2-5). They stay neu 
tral on a roll of 6-8. 

Before any characters actually join, Kana 
dius will secretly test their sincerity with the 
helm of telepathy. As DM, ask the player 
whether his or her character is sincere. Make it 
dear that you, as DM. may forbid the charac 
ter to take certain actions later that go against 
what the player decides now. Then ask for the 
player's decision. 

Only male fighters, dwarves, halflings. and 
elves of Lawful alignment may become full 
members of the Brotherhood of Gorm. They 
will be taken to room 24 on Tier 3 for a simple 
initiation ceremony run by Kanadius. Other 
characters, if accepted as lesser members, will 
be given a necklace with a small golden mask 
of Gorm attached (worth 20 gp). 

Regular members will be given tunics, 
masks, and any normal armor or weapons they 
might need. The Brotherhood has another 
stronghold deep in the underground city. 
Extra masks and necklaces arc stored there. It 
will take about half a day for a messenger to go 
to the stronghold and return with extra masks 
and necklaces. While the party waits, the 
Brothers of Gorm will aid the party against 
wandering monsters. The DM may also treat 
the Brotherhood's rooms as "safe" (free from 
wandering monsters). The party can rest, 
rememorizc spells, and so on if they stay long 
enough. 


TIERS 3 AND 4 

(Dungeon Level 2) 

The second level of the dungeon consists of 
Tier 3 and Tier 4 of the pyramid. Tier 3 
includes rooms 13-24. The third tier contains 
the headquarters for the Brotherhood of 
Gorm, the Magi of Usamigaras, and the War 
rior Maidens of Madarua These can become 
"safe" areas for characters who join these 
groups. Tier 4 includes rooms 25-40. It holds 
the burial chambers of King Alexander. 
Queen Zcnobia and many important court 
officials from their time. 

The Revolving Passage. The central area is 
the most unusual feature of the third tier. It 
houses a passage on a turntable. A machine 
like system of weights and counter-weights 
makes the passage turn. 

On the wall inside each of the revolving 
passage is a row of eight buttons. They match 
the burtons in the halls. When one of the 
inside buttons is pressed, that end of the pas 
sage will swing clockwise to line up with the 
proper hall. 

A door to the central area will open only if 
the revolving passage is lined up with it. Next 
to each door to the revolving passageway is a 
button with a symbol on it. When the buttom 
is pressed, the passage swings clockwise co line 
up with the door, making faint grinding nois 
es. If the passage is already lined up with the 
door, nothing happens. 

Wandering Monsters 

Wandering monsters arc encountered on a roll 
of 1 on ld6. Check for wandering monsters 
once every 2 game turns. Roll 1 d8 on the Wan 
dering Monster Table: Level 2 table for the 
monster encountered, or choose one. 

Bat, Giant. Giant bats "see" by echo-location 
(like radar). One of the giant bats encoun 
tered is a giant vampire bat. Any character 
bitten by this bat must save vs. Paralysis or fall 
unconscious for 1-10 rounds. Any character 
killed by the bite of a giant vampire bat must 
save vs. Spells or become an undead creature 
24 hours after death. The DM chooses which 
undead creature the victim will become. 

Brotherhood of Gorm. This encounter will 
be with a party of the Brothers of Gorm travel 
ing to their shrine in room 24. For more 
details about the Brothers see rooms 11 and 
12 . 

Cynidicean. See the encounters given 
under "Cynidicean'' in the New Monsters sec 
tion or make up new ones.

THE LOST CITY 


Hobgoblin. These are on a mission for the 
Priests of Zargon (capturing prisoners, raiding 
another faction, or so on). 

Magi of Usamigaras. This is a party of Magi 
traveling to their shrine in room 14. For mote 
details about the Magi, sec room 14. 

Rock Baboon. Rock baboons are larger, 
more intelligent versions of normal baboons. 
They will eat anything, but prefer meat. Rock 
baboons do not make tools but use bones or 
branches as clubs. They arc ferocious and have 
vicious tempers. These arc hunting for food. 

Snake, Spitting Cobra. A spitting cobra is a 
3' long, grayish-white snake that can squirt a 
stream of venom a distance of 6'. It aims for its 
victim's eyes. If the venom hits, the victim 
must save vs. Poison or be blinded- While the 
snake will usually spit its venom, it may bite 
instead. If a victim is bitten, he or she must 
save vs. Poison or die. (Note on Blindness. In 
the D&D Basic rules, a blinded character can 
attack at -4. The DM may create special ways 
to cute blindness. For example, the DM might 
allow washing the victim's eyes with holy 
water, then casting a cure light wounds spell 
on the victim. The cure spell would not restore 
any lost hit points if it was used to heal blind 
ness. Instead of being immediately cured, 
sight might return in 1-6 turns.) 

Warrior Maidens of Madania. This party of 
Warrior Maidens is traveling to their shrine in 
room 23. 

DM NOTE: The outcome of an encounter 
with one of the three factions often depends 
on previous encounters. For example, charac 
ters who have joined the Brotherhood of 
Gorm. and are wearing its masks or necklaces, 
will likely find a group of Warrior Maidens 
unfriendly, if not openly hostile.

KEY TO TIER 3 

13. ABANDONED CEREMONIAL 
CHAMBER 


This room is a ruined chapel of some kind. 
Tattered tapestries hang from the walls. A 
dusty altar along the north wall is covered 
with a rotted altar cloth. The candlesticks, 
offering bowl, and holy symbol on the 
altar are carved out of wood. The holy sym 
bol looks like an eye. Next to the altar you 
sec a 6' long lizard with wide flaps of skin 
between its legs. 


The giant lizard is a Draco (AC 5; HD 4 + 2; 
hp 20; MV 40', fly 70'; #AT 1; D 1-10; Save 
F3; ML 7; AL N). Behind the altar is the 
remains of a human thief. The body has a full 
canteen and a sack containing 400 gp and 2 
gems, each worth 100 gp. The candlesticks, 
bowl and holy symbol arc made from rare 
tcakwood. They arc worth 50 gp, 25 gp, and 
25 gp respectively. 

14. THE MAGI OF USAMIGARAS 

This corridor has been painted black with tiny 
white stars to resemble the night sky. The door 
on the north wall to chamber 14a is iron and 
has a star carved into it. If the party opens the 
door, a bell will begin to ring. 

I4a. THE CHAMBER OF THE MAGI 


Along the north and west walls of this 
room hangs a large tapestry showing the 
major constellations. You have interrupted 
a religious service. Thirteen figures in 
rainbow-colored robes and silver masks 
stand in front of a stone, star-shaped altar. 
The masks match the face of the middle 
statue on the pyramid, the winged child. 
The center-most figure of the group wears 
a silver crown. 


The worshippers are the Magi of Usamigaras 
(AC9; Ml; hp 3 each; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-4; 
Save Ml; ML 8; AL N). Twelve of them arc 
first level magic-users. The one wearing the 
silver crown is Auriga Sirkinos. Chief Mage of 
Usamigaras (AC 9; M3; hp 10; MV 40'; #AT 
1; D 1-4; S9.1 18. W 10. D 12. C 10. Ch 15). 
Each Mage has silver lines forming a small star 
symbol on the palm of his or her tight hand. 

Stout Auriga Sirkinos appears to be jolly 
and fun-loving. His mirth actually hides a 
ruthless personality. He is a fanatic who will 
do anything to promote the cult of Usami 
garas and his own power. He tries his best to 


hide this under a pleasant manner. While he 
will welcome the party, he will also do his best 
to insure that he. personally, retains the most 
power in the cult. However, if it comes to a 
choice between the Magi of Usamigaras or the 
personal power of Auriga Sirkinos. he will 
choose personal power. 

If the party attacks: the twelve first level 
magic-users each have a different spell. Each 
has one of the twelve first level spells listed in 
the D&D Basic rules: charm person, detect 
magic, floating disc, hold portal, light, magic 
missile, protecuon from evil, read languages, 
read magic, shield, sleep, and ventriloquism. 
Auriga Sirkinos has the spells detect magic, 
hold portal, and phantasmal force. Those 
with attack spells will cast them at'che party. 
Those with defensive spells will cast them. All 
will attack the party hand-to-hand, though 
Auriga will run through the door and cast 
hold portal on it if things are going badly. 

Hidden inside the stone altar is a secret 
compartment. It is protected by a poison nee 
dle trap (save vs. Poison or die). Anyone who 
tries to open the compartment without find 
ing and removing the trap will trigger it. 
Insidc the compartment is a mace +1 and a 
wand of magic detection with 5 charges. The 
silver masks arc worth 20 gp each and the 
crown is worth 200 gp. Each magic-user also 
has a silver dagger worth 30 gp. 

If the party doesn't attack: they may learn 
that the Magi of Usamigaras is another cult 
trying to restore the lost glory of Cynidicca. 
AH current members arc Cynidiccans, but the 
Magi are willing to let outsiders join in. The 
DM can decide this or roll 2d6. On a roll of 9- 
12 the party members will be asked to join. 
On a roll of 6-8 the party members may join, 
but will not be asked to. On a roll of 2-5 the 
party will be attacked or driven off as enemies 
or spies from one of the other cults. Subtract 3 
from the roll if the party shows any signs of 
belonging to one of the other groups (such as 
wearing a mask of Gorm). Add 2 to the roll if 
the party can convince the Magi that the party 
has defeated members of another cult. 

Only magic-users, elves, thieves, and clerics 
may become full members. Other classes may 
only become lesser members. Full member 
will be initiated by placing their right hand oi 
the center of the altar, palm down. They the* 
recite the pledge: "I, (character's name), c n 
hereby pledge to serve and obey the gre "' 
Usamigaras." When he or she says the na^ 
"Usamigaras," a five-pointed star will be my 
ically burned into the character's palm. F 
members will be given silver masks, dagj> 
and rainbow-colored robes. 

Lesser members will not be initiated. >ut

will be given a silver ring carved with Usami- 
gara's face The robes, masks, daggers, and 
rings arc kept in a stronghold in the under 
ground city. It will take about half a day for 
them to be fetched. While the party waits, the 
Magi will aid them against wandering mon 
sters, and will provide food and drink. The 
DM may make this a "safe" area. 

15. QUARTERS FOR THE MAGI OF 
USAMIGARAS 


This room contains six double bunkbeds. 
At the foot of each bunkbed are two wood 
en chests. The room looks dean and well 
kept. 


The wooden chests are foot lockers. They con 
tain spare robes and various personal belong 
ings, but nothing of great value. The first 
level Magi in room 14 stay here when away 
from their faction's Lost City stronghold. 

16. QUARTERS FOR THE CHIEF MAGE 
OF USAMIGARAS 


This is a comfortable-looking bedroom 
that shows signs of recent occupation. 
Chained to the foot of the bed is a gray 
wolf. The wolf growls when the door is 
opened. 


The wolf (AC 7; HD 2 + 2; hp 11; MV 60': 
#AT 1; D 1-6; Save FI; ML 6; ALN) was cap 
tured as a cub and has been trained to act as a 
watch dog. It is guarding the personal funds 
of Auriga Sirkinos: 2500 sp and 200 gp kept in 
a locked metal chest under the bed. 

17. ABANDONED STOREROOM 


This room is filled with shelves. Most of 
these are empty, but some contain old 
crates. The shelves are covered with dust 
and a vile-looking yellow fungus that 
grows iti large, thick clusters. 


The yellow fungus is yellow mold (AC n/a; 
HD 2 pet 10 square feet; hp 9 per 10 square 
eet; MV 0; #AT 1; D 1 +6 +spores; Save F2; 
ML n / a; AL N). The mold covers shelves along 
ill four walls. Each 10' square of the room has 
1 HD worth of mold covering it. Hence, there 
ire six separate sections of mold, each with 9 
ip. Yellow mold can only be killed by fire . If it 
ts touched, there is a 50% chance the mold 
vill shoot out a 10' * 10' x 10' cloud of 
spores. Anyone caught in the cloud takes 1-6 
points of damage and must save vs. Death Ray 


or choke to death within 6 rounds. There is 
nothing of value in the crates. 

17a. WATER TRAP 

When a human-sized character crosses the 
room, the DM rolls ld6. On a roll of 1 or 2, 
the trap is sprung. Both doors slam shut and 
water pouts into the 10' x 10' area from vents 
high up in the walls. Unless the trapped char 
acter forces open a door within three tries, or 
thinks of some way to breathe, he or she will 
drown. 

Once the room fills with water, concealed 
drains in the floor open. The water drains out, 
and the trap automatically resets. If a charac 
ter opens the door to room 18 while the water 
is pouring in, the water will rush into room 

18. The water will overturn the basket and 
free the pit vipers inside it (see room 18). then 
disappear down concealed drains. 

18. SECRET ROOM 


This room looks empty except for a large 
wicker basket in the middle of the room. 


Coiled atop the pile of treasure in the basket 
are two 5' long pit vipers (AC 6; HD 2*; hp 9 
each; MV 30'; #AT 2; D 1-4 + poison. Save 
Fl: ML 7; AL N). The bite of these snakes is 
poisonous. Pit vipers always attack first, due 
to their quickness. No initiative roll is needed. 
The wicker basket contains 3000 sp and 5 
gems (10 gp. 50 gp. 100 gp, 100 gp. and 500 
gP)- 

19. SHIFTING WALL 


At the end of this short corridor is an 8' tall 
bronze statue of a winged child with two 
snakes twined around its body. It holds a 
wand in one hand and a handful of coins in 
the other. The statue looks firmly connect 
ed to the wall. 


This statue of Usamigaras is hollow and hides 
a shifting wall. If the wand is pulled left, the 
wall shifts westward to the end of the hall. It 
will block the last 10' section of the hall. The 
wall will stay there for 3 rums, then move back 
to its original position. 

If the wand is pulled right, the statue will 
breathe out a cloud of choking gas. The gas 
cloud covets the 30' length of the corridor. 
Anyone who stays in the area will take 1 point 
of damage per round from the gas. 

The gas will disappear after 2 turns (120 
rounds). There is only one gas charge in the 


sranie (the Magi recharge the statue when nec 
essary). 

19a. STOREROOM 


The room is filled with crates and barrels. 
Four large brown beetles, each about 3' 
long, are breaking into them. 


The beetles are oil beetles (AC 4; HD 2*; hp 
9; MV 40'; #AT 1 + oil; D 1-6; Save Fl; ML 8; 
AL N). Oil beetles can squirt an oily fluid at 
one victim up to 5' away. If the oil hits, it 
raises painful blisters, causing the victim to 
fight with a penalty of -2 on his or her "to 
hit" rolls until a cure light wounds spell is 
used or until 24 hours have passed. If the spell 
is used to cure the blisters, it will not also cure 
points of damage. Oil beetles also have a bite 
attack. 

The crates are filled with dried food and the 
casks are filled with wine. This food was 
recently stored here by the Magi of Usami 
garas and is edible. As long as the crates and 
casks have not been broken open by the bee 
tles, the food and wine will be good, even if 
the crate or barrel has been sprayed with the 
beetles' oil. 

20. ABANDONED CEREMONIAL 
CHAMBER 


This room looks like a ruined chapel. It has 
been looted and deliberately wrecked. The 
stone altar has been smashed, and no cer 
emonial equipment can be seen. The word 
"Zargon" has been scrawled on one wall in 
large letters. 


This ceremonial chamber of the old Immortals 
of Cynidicea was wrecked by the followers of 
Zargon centuries ago. Except for the wreck 
age, the room is empty. 

20a. ENTRANCE TO TIER 4 

A 20' long section of the floor in the southern 
pan of the room has been hinged to swing 
down to the west when anyone steps on it. It 
swings slowly down to rest against a ramp in 
room 38. The hinged floor section is the 
entrance to Tier 4. Characters can walk down 
the floor section into room 38. 

21. ARCH OF THE WARRIOR MAIDENS 


You sec two 10' tall statues of women fight 
ers. The fighters wear masks with the face 


103 












THE LOST CITY 


of the female statue on top of the pyramid. 
The two statues stand with spears out 
stretched to form an arch. The only way 
down the corridor appears to be in single 
file under the crossed spears. 


Just beyond the arch formed by the spears is a 
hidden pressure plate in the floor. Each time 
someone steps on the plate, a hidden chime 
rings in room 23. The chime warns the War 
rior Maidens that someone is approaching the 
shrine and reveals how many are in the party. 

21a. THE CHAMBER OF MADARUA 

The door to this room is locked. If the party 
cannot unlock the door, it can be bartered 
down in 1 turn. If the door is battered down, 
the Warrior Maidens in room 23 will come to 
investigate. 


Near the northeast comer of this room is an 
altar covered with a green and white cloth. 
On the altar sits a 3' tall statue of a woman 
holding a sword and a sheaf of wheat. To 
each side of the statue bums a large white 
candle. In front of the altar itself, incense 
bums in three small braziers. White drapes 
hang on all the walls and the floor is cov 
ered by a green carpet. The room is dust- 
free and has been scrubbed clean. Except 
for die ceremonial equipment, the room 
appears empty. 


The Warrior Maidens of Madarua keep their 
shrine clean, with candles and incense burn 
ing all year round. From tiny holes in the wall, 
hidden by the white cloth hanging, the War 
rior Maidens in room 23 can hear any loud 
noises. The sound carries through room 22, 
which also has been fined with listening 
holes. The Warrior Maidens will investigate 
any loud noises. If any party member has des 
ecrated the shrine, the Warnor Maidens will 
anack. 

22. TREASURE ROOM OF THE WARRIOR 
MAIDENS OF MADARUA 


The room appears to be empty except for a 
large stone vault in the middle of the east 
wall. The vault has a keyhole. It looks like 
the stone slabs that make up the vault are 
too heavy to be moved. 


The stone vault contains the treasure of the 
Warrior Maidens. It is trapped Any character 
standing in front of the keyhole who tries to 
open die vault and fails will be hit by a large 


stone block that falls from the ceiling. The 
stone block will not fall if the key is used or the 
lock is successfully picked. The stone block 
docs 2-12 points of damage. The Warrior 
Maidens in room 23 will hear any loud noises 
in this room (see room 2 la). The treasure of 
the Warrior Maidens of Madarua is 600 ep, 
1000 gp. and 300 pp. 

23. WARRIOR MAIDENS OF MADARUA 


Ten women are seated around a table. 
They all wear bronze chain mail over green 
tunics. Each woman's face is covered by a 
bronze mask of the face of the woman 
whose statue is atop the pyramid. 


The women are all Warrior Maidens of Mada 
rua. Seven are 1st level fighters (AC 5; Fl; hp 
5 each; MV 20'; #AT 1; D 1-8; Save Fl; ML 8; 
AL N). Two arc 2nd level (AC 5 hp; hp 9; MV 
20'; #AT 1; D 1-8; Save F2). The leader of the 
Warrior Maidens is Pandora, Madarua's 
Champion, the tallest and oldest of the wom 
en (AC 5; F3; hp 20; MV 20'; #AT 1 at +3;D 
1-8 + 3; ALN; S 17,112, W 11. D 12, C15, Ch 
14). She wields a sword +1. has a +2 bonus 
in combat from Strength, and raises the 
morale of the Warrior Maidens to 9 She also 
carries the key to the treasure vault in room 
22 . 

Pandora prides herself on being a simple 
fighter. She claims that swift action is the best 
solution to any problem. "When in doubt, 
attack" she often says. Actually she is more 
subde than she leads people to believe. She 
always keeps track of the odds. While she 
often uses force to settle problems, she tries to 
make sure that the odds are with her. She 
raises the morale of any Warrior Maidens she is 
with to 9. 

If the party doesn't attack: they may find 
that the Warrior Maidens of Madarua arc 
another group trying to restore the lost glories 
of Cynidicca. All die current members are 
Cynidicean female fighters, but they are will 
ing to take outsiders as members. The DM 
may decide or roll 2d6. On a roll of 9-12 party 
members will be asked to join. On a roll of 6-8 
the party may join, but will not be asked. On 
a roll of 2-5, the party will be attacked or driv 
en off as enemies and spies. Subtract 3 from 
the roll if any characters show signs of belong 
ing to another group. Add 2 to the roll if the 
party proves that they have defeated another 
cult. 

Female fighters, female dwarves, female 
halflings. and female elves can become full 
members of the Warrior Maidens of Madarua. 


All other characters may only become lesser 
members. 

Characters wanting to become full mem 
bers will undergo a short initiation ceremony. 
The character draws her sword and pricks one 
of her fingers with it. She smears the blood 
from her finger on the sword blade. The sword 
is then placed on the alter of Madarua. The 
character swears to uphold the honor of Mada 
rua. even with her own blood if necessary. 
Finally, a small sickle is branded on the inside 
of the initiate's left wrist. Full members will 
be given bronze masks and green robes. 

Lesser members will not be initiated. They 
will be given a bronze bracelet showing Mada 
rua's face. The bracelets, robes, and masks are 
kept in a stronghold in the underground city. 
It will take about half a day for them to be 
fetched. While the party waits, the Warrior 
Maidens will aid them against wandering 
monsters. Food and drink will be provided, 
and this may be a "safe" area. 

24. DOOR TRAP 


\bu see an iron door at the end of the corri- 
dot. The door has three lightning bolts 
engraved on it. 


The door guards the ceremonial chamber of 
Gorm (room 24a.). When anyone comes with 
in 10' of the door, it glows with a crackling 
blue light. The door is locked. Once the words 
"By the Immortal Gotm" are spoken, the 
door stops glowing and it is safe to enter. Any 
one who touches the door without saying the 
proper words automatically takes 1-4 points of 
electrical damage while trying to pick the 
lock. 

24a. THE CEREMONIAL CHAMBERS OF 
GORM 


The walls, ceiling, and floor of this room 
have been painted sky blue. A golden mar 
ble altar, surrounded by golden candle- 
holders and braziers, rests along the 
middle of the east wall. On top of the altar 
is a small stone statue of a bearded man 
throwing a lightning bolt. Next to the 
statue rests a golden bowl. 


These are the ceremonial chambers of Gorm. 
No non-members arc allowed in this room. 
New members of the Brotherhood are initi 
ated here. The initiation is simple. The char 
acter dresses in a white robe and ritually 
washes his hands in the bowl (which contains 
water). He draws his weapon and kneels 


104 








THE LOST CITY 


before Gorm's altar. He then swears, in Law, 
to uphold the ideals of the Brotherhood and 
to promote the worship of Gorm. Finally, the 
new memoer receives a tattoo of a blue light 
ning bolt on his right shoulder. 

The secret door in the west wall conceals a 
ladder up to room 12 on Tier 2. 

KEY TO TIER 4 

Tier 4 holds the burial chambers of King Alex 
ander, Queen Zenobia, and major nobles, 
clerics, and others who lived during their 
reign. 

25. NOBLEMAN'S BURIAL ROOM 


This room has scenes of warfare painted on 
the walls. It also has a large wooden sar 
cophagus standing upright along the south 
wall. Painted on the outside of the sar 
cophagus is the picture of a warrior in 
armor. Squatting on each side of the sar 
cophagus is a large ape with white fur. 


These two creatures are white apes (AC 6; HD 
4; hp 18 each; MV 40'; #AT 2; D 1-4/1-4; 
Save F2; ML 7; AL N). The white apes have 
made this room their lair. When the room 
door is opened, the apes will beat their chests 
and threaten the party. If their threats are 
ignored, they will attack. 

White apes sometimes throw rocks for ld6 
points of damage each. These have gathered a 
plentiful supply of rocks to defend their lair. 

Inside the sarcophagus is a mummified 
body wearing full plate armor and holding a 
sword. The sword is a magical sword +1. 

25a. GHOSTIY HAUNTS 


As you walk down the corridor, the shim 
mering. ghostlike figures of a man and a 
woman appear before you. They are 
dressed in costly clothing, and both wear 
golden crowns. The man raises his hand 
and gestures for you to stop. 

"Go no further," he warns, "lest the 
curse of King Alexander overtake you!" 

"I am Queen Zenobia," the woman 
says. "Turn back; only death awaits you!" 


The shimmering figures of King Alexander 
nd Queen Zenobia are haunts. Characters 
/ho see the haunts must save vs. Spells or try 
run away in fear. The fear lasts for 1 -4 turns. 
ic haunts are otherwise harmless. Since they 
ve no -cal physical existence, haunts cannot 
t hurt by physical attack or spie 11s. 


26. TOMB ANNEX 


The floor of this long, narrow room has a 
red and white checkerboard pattern of 2' 
x 2' squares. Court scenes arc painted on 
the north and south walls. In the east wall, 
there is a 2' high opening at floor level near 
the southeast comer. 


Room 26 is the annex to the burial chambers 
of King Alexander and Queen Zenobia. This 
corridor was kept open when the pyramid was 
built in order to bring in the bodies of the 
king and queen. After the funerals, the corri 
dor was sealed from the outside. 

26a. TOMB TRAPS 

Three pendulum blades are hidden in the 
ceiling. If a character walks into any of the 
three marked squares, roll ld6. On a roll of 1 
the trap is triggered. Victims caught in the 
trap, or characters who try to run through the 
swinging blades, will be unhurt if they roll 
their dexterity score or lower on ld20. Those 
who fail each take ldlO points of damage. 
The pendulum shafts are covered with a sticky 
green goo that looks like green slime. The goo 
is harmless. The blades will swing for one 
turn, then automatically reset. 

Special 10' square ceiling blocks were 
designed to fall and block the passage after 
the burials. The 2' high opening in the east 
wall was formed when one block failed to fall 
all the way. A 2' high crawl-space remains 
between the floor and the bottom of the 
block. The block looks like it will fall no fur 
ther. But the party cannot be sure. The DM 
should increase the tension by telling the par 
ty that they hear creaking noises coming from 
the stone block as they are crawling under 
neath it. 

The next obstacle the party must overcome 
are two stone blocks that cracked into rubble 
when they fell. It will take the party a full turn 
to clear away enough rubble so they can go 
further. 

The final obstacle is a narrow, twisting cor 
ridor, wide enough for but one person at a 
time. The corridor was formed when several 
stone blocks fell crookedly. 

27. COUNCILOR'S BURIAL ROOM 

The door to this room has a 2' wide hole 
gnawed in it near the floor. 

Painted on the walls of this room are scenes 

of a throne room with a man giving advice 


to kings and queens. In the center of the 
room lies a wooden coffin. Large holes have 
been gnawed in the sides of the coffin. 


The holes in the coffin and the door have been 
gnawed by 3 giant shrews (AC 4; HD 1*; hp 4 
each; MV 50'; #AT 2; D I -6/1-6; Save Fl; ML 
10; AL N). The giant shrews have made the 
coffin their lair. The coffin is empty except for 
the giant shrews. The body and any treasure 
have been stolen. 

The giant shrews have burrowed through a 
weak spot in the door and use the hole as an 
exit when they go hunting in the pyramid cor 
ridors. 

Like bats, giant shrews depend on sound 
"echoes" to "sec." As soon as the giant shrews 
sense anything nearby, they will attack. 
Because of their quickness, they always gain 
initiative on the first attack, and are +1 on 
initiative for the second attack. Their ferocity 
is so great that any character of third level or 
less attacked by them must save vs. Death Ray 
or run away in fear A silence, 15' spell will 
blind them. 

27a. TRAP DOOR 


In the middle of the floor at this point is a 
large stone slab with a bronze ring bolted 
deeply into it. 


The slab is a trap door. When the trap door is 
opened the party will sec an iron ladder lead 
ing down to room 44 on Tier 5. 

28. HIGH PRIEST'S BURIAL ROOM 


The door to this room is scorched, as is the 
end of the corridor. The oudine of a man- 
sized humanoid form is etched into the 
scorched wall section. The door to the 
room is slightly open, but not enough to 
see into the room. 


The man-sized outline is that of a ghoul. The 
ghoul was blasted to ashes when it accidently 
triggered the magical trap guarding the door. 
Now that the trap has been triggered, the 
door can be opened safely. 


Along the walls arc paintings of a priest 
performing ceremonies. On a raised dais in 
the middle of the room lies an open bronze 
sarcophagus. Here, three hideous, beast- 
like humanoids are tearing a mummified 
body apart with their sharp claws. 


105 










THE LOST CITY 


The three creatures arc ghouls (AC 6; HD 2*; 
hp 9 each; MV 30'; #AT 3; D 1-3 all; Save F2; 
ML 9 AL C). Any non-elf creature hit by a 
ghoul must make a save vs. Paralyzation or be 
paralyzed. Tossed inside the sarcophagus are a 
jeweled necklace worth 1500 gp and two jew 
eled bracelets each worth 600 gp. The ghouls 
have stripped them from the body and thrown 
them away. 

29. EMBALMING ROOM 


This room contains several large tables. 
Around the walk are a number of large jars 
and casks. There is a bin in the northwest 
comer of the room. 


This room was used for embalming (preparing 
bodies for burial). Concealed in the room are 5 
shadows (AC 7; HD 2*; hp 11 each; MV 30'; 
#ATl;Dl-4 + drain strength; Save F2; ML 12; 
ALC). They will surprise the party on a roll of 1- 
5 on ld6. These intelligent ghost-like creatures 
look like real shadows, if a shadow scores a hit, it 
will drain 1 point of Strength in addition to 
doing normal damage. This weakness will last 8 
turns. Shadows cannot be affected by sleep or 
chum spells. They can only be hit by magical 
weapons. If the party has no magical weapons, it 
is suggested that the DM let them run away after 
the first shadow attack. The shadows will not 
leave this room. 

If the party destroys the shadows they can 
search the room. The jars and casks arc filled 
with various spices used in embalming. The 
spices have been stored in this room so long 
that they are now worthless. The bin is filled 
with rotten linen winding cloths. Underneath 
the rotten linen is a potion of invisibility and a 
chest filled with 3000 sp. 

30. LADY-IN-WAITING BURIAL ROOM 


A white ivory coffin lies in a niche in the 
cast wall. Painted on the walk are scenes 
from court life, focusing on the life of 
ladies-in-waiting to Queen Zenobia. 


The cdfin k empty. Except for the coffin, the 
room k empty. 

31. GUARD CAPTAIN'S BURIAL ROOM 


A mummified human in plate armor and 
holding a halberd stands at attention 


against the west side of the south wall. 
Grouped around the mummy arc nine 
skeletons holding swords, also at atten 
tion. 


The mummified body k one of the guard cap 
tains from the reign of King Alexander. It k 
not an undead monster and its armor and 
weapons arc normal. The skeletons are 
undead monsters (AC 7; HD 1; hp 4 each; MV 
20'; #AT 1; D 1-6; Save Fl; ML 12; AL C). 
They will attack the party as soon as the char 
acters enter and will fight until destroyed. 
There k no treasure here. 

32. QUEEN ZENOBIA'S BURIAL 
CHAMBER 


The walk of thk room are plain stone. An 
oblong box made from stone slabs lies in 
the center of the room. Written in several 
languages on the side of the box are the 
words: "May the curse of darkness destroy 
all who dare desecrate my resting place." 
The box k 3' high, 7' long, and 3' wide. 


The stone box contains the wooden coffin of 
Queen Zenobia. If the coffin is opened, the 
party will find that Zenobia k now a wight 
(AC 5; HD 3*; hp 24; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 
energy drain; Save F3; ML 12; AL C). She will 
attack on sight (roll initiative normally). A 
wight can only be hit by silvered or magical 
weapons. Each hit by the wight drains one 
level of experience (including one hit die) 
from the victim. The queen's chamber once 
contained a treasure trove. However, the only 
treasure left k the jeweled crown she wean 
(5000 gp) and her sceptre (actually a wand of 
paralyzation with 8 charges). Since becoming 
a creature of darkness, she has forgotten how 
to use the wand, 

33. FALSE TOMB 


Thk room contains two large sarcophagi. 
Both gleam with golden highlights. One 
sarcophagus k marked "Alexander," the 
other k marked "Zenobia." Surrounding 
the sarcophagi are a number of large wood 
en chests. The room k littered with broken 
objects: two smashed thrones, a broken 
chariot, smashed pottery, broken weapons, 
and tom clothing. Piles of bones covet the 
floor. On the walk is a mosaic showing 
famous events from the reign of King 
Alexander and Queen Zenobia. 


Thk k not the real tomb of King Alexander 
and Queen Zenobia. Thk k a fake tomb to 
fool grave robbers. The bodies inside the sar 
cophagi arc actually those of royal slaves. The 
real burial chambers of the king and queen are 
rooms 32 and 34. 

The sarcophagi are made of wood, painted 
to look like gold. The chests contain small 
items a king and queen might need in the 
afterlife. All the items have been ritually 
"killed" (broken, ripped, or smashed) just 
like the larger items littering the floor. The 
piles of bones are the remains of royal slaves 
and royal animals killed after the funeral. 

Four chests apparently contain 5000 sp, 
6000 gp, 3000 ep. and 2000 pp. In the sar 
cophagi are 50 gems and 12 pieces of jewelry. 
All coins and treasure are cheap counterfeits. 
The actual value of all the items in the room k 
only 450 gp. Dwarves or thieves will notice 
that the gems, jewek, and coins are fake on a 
roll of 1-5 (on ld6, one roll only). If the party 
does not have a dwarf or a thief, they will only 
notice the deception on a roll of 1-3. 

If the parry taps on the walk (using a ham 
mer. wooden pole, or some similar object) 
they will notice hollow sounds where the 
secret doors open into the hidden corridors. If 
the party cannot open the secret doors, they 
can try to break them down. Thk will take 6 
turns plus ld6 turns. The DM should hint by 
description that the party k making progress 
(though slowly) until they finally break in. 
The DM should describe all the noke the par 
ty k making as well. Wandering monsters are 
rolled for normally. 

34. KING ALEXANDER'S BURIAL 
CHAMBER 


The walk of thk room are bare. In the cen 
ter of the room k an oblong box made 
from stone slabs. Suddenly, rising out of 
the stone box k a translucent, ghost-like 
figure. The pale figure has glowing red 
eyes and a large, dark mouth. 


The translucent, ghost-like figure k a wailing 
fey (AC 3; HD 5*; hp 26; MV 50'; #AT 1; D 
wail for 1-4; Save F5; ML 12; AL C). The wail 
ing fey is a new monster. A wailing fey k a 
supernatural creature that warns certain fami 
lies of an approaching death or mourns for 
certain individuak after their deaths. Wailing 
feys can only be hit by magical weapons or 
harmed by magical spelk. 

The wailing fey k guarding King Alexan 
der's grave. It attacks by wailing. The DM 
should describe the wailing fey's piercing wail 


106 










THE LOST CITY 


and tell the party they can feel an icy death 
like chill. Then the DM should roll initiative. 
If the part)' wins initiative and runs out of 
range, they take no damage. Otherwise, all 
individuals within 30' of the wailing wailing 
fey take an automatic 1-4 points of damage 
per rpund from the wailing attack. If the party- 
can getfratsidc the room, and dose the door 
between themselves and the wailing fey. they 
will be safe (even if still within the 30' range of 
the wail). The wailing fey will attack as soon as 
the tomb door is opened. 

King Alexander's tomb was looted long 
ago, except for the treasure inside the wooden 
coffin (which is inside the stone box). King 
Alexander wean a jeweled crown worth 5000 
gp. He has plate armor + ] and a sword + 2. 

35. SLAVE'S BURIAL ROOM 


This room is filled with skeletons. The bones 
lie in pile;: on the floor. They cover the floor 
so thickly that it is impossible to walk across 
the room without walking on bones. 


The skeletons are the remains of household 
slaves belonging to the various individuals 
buried in the pyramid. Upon the deaths of 
their masters, the slaves were herded together 
and killed, then tossed into this room. The 
skeletons are not undead. They are merely 
bones. 

36. CHAM BERLIN 'S BURIAL ROOM 


The waJL" of this room show painted scenes 
of a man signing documents and organiz 
ing tax collection. A wooden coffin that 
has been smashed open is lying on the 
floor. Six pale-skinned humans stand 
around the coffin. They all have wounds 
bad enough to kill a normal person. 


The six humans are zombies (AC 8; HD 2; hp 
9 each; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1-8; Save FI; ML 
12; AL C). Zombies arc undead. They will 
attack the party on sight and fight until 
destroyed, always striking last. Zombies are 
immune to sleep and charm spells. The coffin 
-as already been looted. 

> GIANT RAT LAIR 


This room appears to be empty except for 
an odd-shaped mound in the southwest 


comer of the room. Rustling and faint 
squeaking noises seem to come from the 
mound. 


Ten 3' long, gray rats have made a nest in the 
corner of the room. These arc giant rats (AC 7; 
HD 1/2; hp 2 each; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-3 + 
disease; SaveNM; ML 8; ALN). Each giant rat 
has a 1 in 20 chance of having a disease. A 
character bitten by a diseased rat must save vs. 
Poison or be infected The disease has a 1 in 4 
chance of being fatal in 1 d6 days, otherwise 
the character will be sick in bed (no adventur 
ing) for one month. 

The rats' nest conceals a small hole in the 
west wall. This hole is just big enough for a 
giant rat to crawl through. It leads to the corri 
dor to the west. Inside the rat's nest arc 300 gp 
and four 500 gp gems. 

38. JESTER S BURIAL ROOM 

The floor from the tier above (20a) hinges 
down to meet a ramp in this room. 

Painted on the walls of this room are court 
scenes showing King Alexander and 
Queen Zcnobia being entertained by a 
dwarven jester. A small coffin rests in a 
niche in the cast wall and in each comer of 
the room is a large brass jar. 


If the lid of the coffin is touched, it will spring 
off. An oversized wooden model of the head 
of the dwarven jester, painted in bright colors, 
will jump up. The head is attached to a coiled 
spring like a jack-in-the-box. The coffin also 
contains the ashes of the jester. The brass jars 
look empty, but any item put completely into 
any of them will be instantly teleported into a 
large concealed hollow beneath the coffin. 
The jars were used by the jester as his master 
trick, in which he made items disappear to 
amuse the court. The party can get to the hol 
low by removing the coffin. 

39. ROLLING BOULDER TRAP 

Any character who reaches the west door to 
room 39a will trigger this trap. The wall in the 
north corridor opens and a 10' wide, round 
boulder rolls out of the hidden area. The 
boulder will roll down the long corridor at 40' 
per round. When it stops, it will block the cor 
ner near room 40 

This boulder trap is not meant to kill player 
characters, only scare them. Unless the party 
docs something obviously stupid (like stand 
ing and arguing while the boulder is rolling 


toward them), the DM should let the party- 
escape after a close shave-into the room or 
around a comer. The DM should describe the 
rolling boulder as graphically as possible; 
crashing sounds echoing down the corridor, 
stone chips flying where the boulder smashes 
against the wall, the corridor floor shaking 
from the force of the boulder, etc. The 
encounter should be exciting, but not deadly. 

If the boulder strikes a character, it will do 
3-30 points of damage. The boulder will stop 
after it strikes one character or reaches the end 
of the hall. 

39a. NOBLE LADY'S BURIAL ROOM 


A sarcophagus rests on a dais in the center 
of the room. The dais is 10' square. From 
each comer of the dais rises a slender. 6' tall 
column. The tops of the columns meet the 
comers of an arched dome above the sar 
cophagus. On the dais at each end of the 
sarcophagus is a brass jar from which 
flames dance. Finally, the walls of this 
room are painted with scenes from the life 
of a noble lady. 


The noble lady's mummified body rests in the 
sarcophagus. The jewelry once worn by the 
corpse has been stolen. The brass jars are bolt 
ed to the floor and their flames cannot be put 
out. However, behind one of the brass jars is a 
small bronze tube. It contains a piece of 
parchment. The parchment is a map of the 
southwest pan of this tier marked with a large 
black "X." The "X" represents the location of 
the trap door at 27a. The DM can either make 
a map or guide the party to the trapdoor when 
they get dose. 

40. MASTER THIEF'S BURIAL ROOM 


An elaborate jeweled coffin lies in the cen 
ter of the room. Next to the coffin is a 
worm-like creature. 9' long and 3' high. It 
has many legs and its mouth is surrounded 
by eight tentacles. Each tentacle is 2' long. 


The creature is a carrion crawler (AC 7; HD 
3 + 1*; hp 13; MV 40'; #AT 8; D paralysis; 
Save F2; ML 9; AL N). A hit by a carrion crawl 
er paralyzes the victim unless a save vs. Paraly 
sis is made. The paralysis can be removed by a 
cure light wounds spell, but any spell so used 
will have no other effect. Without a spell, the 
paralysis will wear off in 2-8 turns. The jewels 
on the coffin are worth 3000 gp A search of 
the body will discover a set of lockpicks. 


107 









THE LOST CITY 


A master thief from the reign of King Alex 
ander and Queen Zenobia used his skills to 
steal a place near the King and Queen in the 
afterlife. He managed to exchange his own 
coffin for that of the nobleman who was sup 
posed to be buried in this room. 

TIER 5 

(Dungeon Level Three) 

The third dungeon level consists of Tier 5 
(rooms 41-58). This tier, including the pyra 
mid's main entrance, is buried under the 
sand. Hidden in the main entry chamber 
(room 50) is a secret door to a passage leading 
to the underground city. 

Wandering Monsters 

Wandering monsters are encountered on a roll 
of 1 on ld6. Check for wandering monsters 
once every 2 turns. Roll ld8 on the Wandering 
Monster Table: Level 3 table for the type of 
monster encountered, or choose one. 

Tiger Beetle. Tiger beetles are 4' long and 
have striped carapaces that look like tiger 
skins. They are carnivorous and will attack if 
hungry. 

Cynidieean. As usual, the DM may use the 
encounters given later, or make up a new one. 
This could also be an encounter with members 
of one of the factions. 

Giant Ant. Giant ants are huge black ants 
about 6' long. When hungry, they will eat 
anything in their path. Further, once in com 
bat, they will fight to the death with no 
moral; checks. The DM can add a special tun 
nel to their lair, if desired. 

Tuatara. A tuatara is an 8' long giant lizard 
that looks like a cross between an iguana and a 
toad. It has pebble-colored olive skin and 
white spikes along its back. It is carnivorous 
and attacks when hungry. A tuatara has a 
membrane over its eyes which, when lowered, 
gives the giant lizard 90' infravision. 

Rust Monster. This monster escaped from 
the Magi of Usamigaras 

Tboul. A thoul is a magical combination of 
a ghoul, a hobgoblin, and a troll (for trolls, 
see D&D Expert rules). Thouls look like hob 
goblins. The party will think these thouls arc 
hobgoblins until they attack. In combat, a 
character hit by a thoul must save vs. Paralysis 
or be paralyzed. (This is like a ghoul's touch, 
even tnough thouls are not undcad.) A thoul 
regenerates lost hit points while it is alive. 
After a thoul is hit, the DM adds 1 to its hit 
points at the beginning of each combat 


round. The thouls serve the Priests of Zargon. 
They hunt for prisoners to take back to the 
Underground City. 

KEY TO TIER 5 

41. STORAGE ROOM 

Shelves line the walls of this room. Stored 
on the shelves are items used in religious 
ceremonies (candles, incense, clerical 
robes, etc.). Three huge, fearsome human 
like creatures wearing animal skins have 
smashed open a box of candles and arc eat 
ing them. 


The three human-like creatures are ogres (AC 
5; HD 4 +1; hp 19 each; MV 30'; #AT 1; D 1- 
8 + 2; Save F4; ML 10; AL C). Ogres are not 
too bright. They thought the candles looked 
good to cat so they started eating them. They 
have three huge leather sacks holding 500 gp. 
500 gp, and 400 gp. a ring of fire resistance. 
and a magic-user/elf scroll (continual light, 
levitate, read languages). 

42. CLERIC'S QUARTERS 


This room contains three bunk beds. Lying 
on them arc humans dressed in bright yel 
low robes. They wear masks of a boar, a 
tiger, and a wolf. 


The masked humans are actually dopple- 
gangers (AC 5; HD 4*; hp 18 each; MV 30'; 
#AT 1; D 1-12; Save F10; ML 10). The dop- 
plegangcrs took the forms of three Cynidi- 
ccans, then killed the originals. They will try 
to join the party, choosing one victim each. 
When they have a chance to do it secretly, they 
will change shape to look like the victim, then 
try to kill the victim and take his or her place. 
They are immune to sleep and charm spells. 
The dopplegangcrs carry 9 gems worth a total 
of 1500 gp. 

43. TREASURE ROOOM 


A slight breeze stirs in the room when the 
door is opened. A large, padlocked wood 
en chest sits near the north wall of the 
room. Behind the chest is a huge tapestry 
of a desert scene. 


The tapestry is actually a new monster, the 
polymar (AC 9; HD 10; bp 45; MV 20'; IAX 
3; D 1-6/1-6/1-6; Save F5; ML 10; AL C). A 
polymar is a semi-intelligent, many-celled 
creature that can reshape its body to look like 


any creature of 10 HD or less, or any object up 
to 10' x 10' x 10' in size. The polymar will not 
have any special abilities, only the shape of 
the object or creature copied. 

A dose examination will show that the tap 
estry is not actually made from woven threads. 
There is a 1 in 6 chance that one of the player 
characters will notice something suspicious, 
even without a dose examination (2 in 6 if an 
elf is present). For example, the tapestry will 
not move in the breeze created when the door 
is opened because the polymar is much heavi 
er than a real tapestry. If the polymar is not 
detected, it will attack with surprise. 

The treasure in the locked chest is 3000 gp, 
a potion of invisibility, chain mail + 1 , and a 
dagger +1. 

44. SECRET ROOM 

The ladder from the trap door at 27 leads 
down into this room. The room is empty. 

45. BEDROOM 


This room contains a bed, a table, a chair, a 
lantern, and a wooden holy symbol of two 
intertwined snakes. The furniture is made 
of wood. A hooded white robe is draped 
over the chair. Except for the furniture and 
the robe, the room appears to be empty. 


This was once the bedroom of Demetrius, a 
6th level deric. Demetrius was an elder in the 
cult of Usamigaras. His twin brother, Darius, 
was a 6th level cleric in the cult of Zargon. 
Yean ago, Demetrius vowed to destroy the 
cult of Zargon. especially his evil brother. But 
Demetrius was assassinated before he could 
even begin his quest. 

Demetrius made a dying wish that his spirit 
live on until Darius was destroyed. The spirit 
of Demetrius now rests in the white robe. Any 
character touching the robe must make a save 
vs. Dragon Breath or be taken over by the spir 
it of Demetrius Demetrius will only possess 
the character long enough to kill Darius (sec 
room 58. 

Though outwardly unchanged, the pos 
sessed character is now a 6th level Lawful cler 
ic. The character will have Demetrius's 
Wisdom (16), Intelligence (10), and hit 
points (31). His saving throws will become: 
Death Ray or Poison = 9, Wands = 8, Turn to 
Stone = 12, Dragon Breath = 14, Spells = 
10 . 

If Demetrius is reduced to 0 hp, the pos 
sessed character will die. 


108 






THE LOST CITY 


Demetrius has the following spells: 

1st level: cure light wounds, detect evil 
2nd level: bless, hold person 
3rd level: striking 
*4th level: cure serious wounds 

(If using the D&D Expert rules only.) 

The DM should allow the player whose char 
acter has been possessed to play Demetrius. 
Take the player aside and tell him or her what 
is happening, with as much background as 
you think is needed. Encourage the player to 
role play Demetrius as much as possible. Be 
ready to remind the player, if necessary, that 
Demetrius' only goal is to kill his brother 
Darius, and consider disallowing player 
actions that are out of character. 

Demetrius knows the way to room 58, 
including any secret doors on the way. He does 
not know about any of the traps on this level. 
As long as the party moves by the quickest 
route to Darius (room 58), Demetrius may 
help them defeat monsters. 

Demetrius will depart once Darius is dead, 
and the white robe will disintegrate. The pos 
sessed character will be magically restored to 
his or her own full hit points when Dcmctnus 
leaves. 

46. KITCHEN-DINING ROOM 


This room appears to be an abandoned 
kitchen and dining room combination. 
The cupboards, table, and chairs arc cov 
ered with a thin layer of dust. Near the 
table, two large snakes with brown and yel 
low scales are coiled around the body of a 
woman wearing a rabbit mask. 


The two snakes arc rock pythons (AC 6; HD 
5*; hp 23 each; MV 30'; #AT 2; D 1-4/2-8; 
Save F3; ML 8; AL N). They will attack the 
party on sight. If a python's bite attack is suc 
cessful. it will coil around the victim and con 
strict in the same round fot 2-8 points of 
damage. Thereafter, the constriction attack 
automatically hits each round. Around the 
neck of the dead Cynidiccan is a necklace 
worth 700 gp. Concealed in her robes is a full 
water bot tle and a small pouch of food. 

47. LIVING ROOM 


The room looks like a living room. It con 
tains wall hangings and ornate divans. 
There are several pieces of sculpture in the 
room, as well as an iron statue of a warrior 
on each side of the doorway just inside the 


room. Everything is covered by a thin layer 
of dust. 


The statues arc actually living iron statues (AC 
2; HD 4*; hp 18 each; MV 10', D 1-9/1-8 + 
special; Save F4; ML 11; AL N). They will 
attack if the party enters the room and allows 
the door to swing shut. While the door is held 
of jammed open, the statues will not attack. 

If a statue is hit by a non-magical metal 
weapon, the attackers must save vs. Spells. 
Failure means the weapon sticks to the body of 
the iron statue and cannot be pulled away 
until the statue is destroyed. Living iron 
statues are not affected by sleep spells. 

48. HIDDEN GUARDROOM 


Four humans wearing stylized rat masks 
and red robes trimmed with rat fur leap to 
their feet and look at you. In the northeast 
comer of the room are stairs going down. 


The four men are actually were rats (AC 7; HD 
3*; hp 13 each; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-4; Save F3; 
ML 8; AL C). These lycanthropes arc disguised as 
Cynidiccans so they can safely rob the citizens 
when they get a chance. If threatened, the werc- 
rats will change into giant rat form and fight or 
run. Like other lycanthropes. were rats in animal 
form can only be hit by silvered or magical weap 
ons. They have a small chest with 2000 sp and 4 
gems worth a total of 700 gp. 

The stairs end in a brickcd-up wall, unless 
the DM wants to add the underground city. 

49. CONSULEAnON ROOM 


The room is paneled with wood, and a dusty 
carpet covets the floor A large, heavy desk 
sirs in the centcrof the room. Several wooden 
chairs are grouped north of the desk. Behind 
the desk is a large plush chair, while behind 
the chair on the south wall is a mounted 
lion's head. Four large painted urns stand in 
the comers of the room. Finally, on both 
sides of the north doorway arc stone pedestals 
with stone statues of winged beasts with 
claws, fangs, and horns. 


The two statues are gargovles (AC 5; HD 4*; hp 
18 each; MV 30'. fly 50'; #AT4; D 1-3/ 1-3/1- 
6/1-4; Save F8; ML 11; AL C). If the party is 
expecting gargoyles when they see the statues, 
toll initiative normally. If not. the party will be 
surprised. The gargoyles will attack as soon as the 
party enters the room. They can only be hit with 
magical weapons and are not affected by sleep 


or charm spells. The desk has three drawers and a 
locked cabinet. Inside the cabinet are 2000 ep, a 
mace +1, and a poison potion. Hidden in the 
cushion of the plush chair are 18 gems each 
worth 100 gp. The urns and lion head contain 
nothing of value. 

49a. PIT TRAP 

This floor section conceals a hidden 10' deep 
pit filled with spikes. The DM should roll for 
each character entering this area-the trap is 
triggered on a roll of 1 or 2 on ld6. Characters 
falling into the pit will take 2-12 (2d6) points 
of damage. Remember that Demetrius does 
not know about this pit. 

50. MAIN ENTRY CHAMBER 


The high, arched ceiling of this room is 
supported by a double row of pillars. Each 
pillar is carved into a statue of a king or 
queen of Cynidicea. A series of mosaic pic 
tures decorate the walk of the room. These 
stan in the northeast comer and continue 
clockwise around the room. In the center 
of the nonh wall is a pair of huge stone 
doors. At the base of the double doots, the 
floor is partially coveted with sand. 


The mosaics show scenes from the history of 
Cynidicea. From the northwest comer, the 
mosaics show: 

1. A tribe of squat, heavy-browed human 
oids wielding erode stone weapons wor 
ship a lizard-headed god. 

2. A large band of tall, black-haired people 
battle the humanoids and take over their 
hunting grounds. 

3. A village rises over the scene of the battle. In 
the arid lands around the village are fields of 
grain and vast herds of cattle and sheep. 

4. A great leader arises in time of need and 
gathers the villagers into an army that 
destroys an enemy army of snake-headed 
humanoids. 

5. The victorious leader is crowned king, thus 
founding the line of the rulers of Cynidicea. 

6. The stone city of Cynidicea k built on the 
site where the village stood. 

7. Scenes of the splendor of the kingdom at 
its height. 

8. The births of King Alexander and Queen 
Zcnobia. 

9. The great pyramid k built. 

10. Slaves digging under the pyramid uncov 
er the foundations of an ancient temple. 


109 








THE LOST CITY 


11. The death of King Alexander and Queen 
Zcnobia and their burial in the pyramid. 

12. The worship of the old Immortals Gorm. 
Usamigaras, and Madarua is replaced by 
the worship of a large humanoid with 
many tentacles. 

13. Life becomes a year-round carnival for the 
Cynidiceans. All Cynidiceans are now 
masked. 

14. The Cynidiceans meet a barbaric, golden- 
haired people (the ancestors of the 
Heldann tribes). 

13. The final picture is not a mosaic. It is a 
crudely painted sketch that shows the 
tribesmen looting Cynidicca. 

There is room on the wall for more pictures, 
but the space is blank. The huge doors, which 
open outward, are blocked by sand and can 
not be opened. There is no treasure here. 

50a. SECRET ENTRANCE TO THE 
UNDERGROUND CITY 

This secret trap door leads to a passageway to 
the underground city. The party can find this 
door only if the DM is continuing the adven 
ture past the upper pyramid. 

51. CHAPEL 


This large room is obviously a place of wor 
ship. On each side of a broad center aisle 
are rows of high-backed wooden benches. 
Narrow aisles along the walls run past 
ornate mosaics to two small fountains set 
into the walls. Just past the fountains, a 
large dais fills the southern end of the 
room. On the dais near a stone altar lie 
three large statues that look like the ones 
on top of the pyramid. The statues have 
been toppled from their bases. A man and 
a woman stand near the toppled statues 
and talk softly to each other. They wear 
brightly colored clothing and small bronze 
fox masks. Both have ted hair and there 
seems to be a resemblance between them. 


This brother and sister arc actually werefoxes 
(AC 9, 6 as fox; HD 3 + 2*; hp 16 each; MV 
40', 60 as fox; (CAT 1; D by weapon or 1-6; 
Save F3; ML 8; AL N). They arc disguised as 
Cynidiceans to be better able to hunt for trea 
sure and supplies. Werefoxes are a new type of 
lycanthropc (sec Monsters). Each werefox can 
try to chsum a person of the opposite sex in 
one round. This ability is like a chirm person 
spell, but lasts only one day. A werefox can 
charm up to three times per day. 


These werefoxes may bargain with the party or 
try to chsum them. They will try to trick the party- 
out of as much treasure and magic as possible. 
The two will not take risks they can avoid, or 
fight stronger opponents unless forced to. They 
rely on their wits to survive. If attacked, the two 
will turn into foxes to fight or escape. If hard 
pressed, they may mm back into human form 
and surrender. The werefoxes will lie, cheat, and 
bribe the party if necessary to survive. They arc 
carrying three pieces of jewelry worth a total of 
3000 gp, a sword +1, casts light on command 
(30' radius), a helm of alignment change, and a 
potion. So far, they have been afraid to test the 
potion and don't know what it is. It is a potion 
of levitation. If forced to fight as humans, the 
female will use the magical sword in combat. 

This room was once the main chapel for 
Cynidicca. It is seldom used now. The foun 
tains arc fed by an underground lake. These 
will provide all the water the party needs to 
drink or to fill their water skins. 

52. TRAP ROOM 


The entire room is a large sunken pool filled 
with a bubbling liquid. In the center of the 
room is a box made of stone slabs. The lid of 
the box is about a foot above the surface of 
the liquid and is locked with a large iron pad 
lock. 


The bubbling liquid is acid. It will destroy any 
material except stone and will do 2-8 points of 
damage each round to creatures that fall into it. 
The acid is 6' deep. The stone box is on a special 
pedestal. The pedestal will sink at a rate of 1 12' 
per melee round if any weight is placed on the 
boot. If the weight is removed the pedestal will 
rise at the same rate (though never higher than 
1' above the surface of the acid). Inside the box 
are 20,000 sp and a clerical scroll (purify food 
and water, remove curse). 

53. ABANDONED CLERICAL QUARTERS 


This room seems oddly damp. A strange 
moist odor fills the air. The room contains a 
low bed, some wooden shelves, and a small 
chest. The contents of the room seem to 
shimmer, as if seen through clear water or a 
thick pane of glass. 


Just inside the doorwav is a gelatinous cube 
(AC 8; HD 4*. hp 18; MV 20'; #AT 1; D 2-8 
+ paraiyzation; Save F2; ML 12; ALN). The 
party is viewing the room through the gelati 
nous cube. The monster will move toward and 
attack the party immediately. Victims hit by a 


gelatinous cube must make a save vs. Paralysis 
or be paralyzed for 2-8 turns (unless the paral 
ysis is removed by a cure light wounds spell). 
The cube may be harmed by fire or weapons, 
but not by cold or lightning. There is nothing 
of value in the room. Its rotted contents will 
crumble when touched. 

54. STORAGE ROOM 


This room is lined racks of wine bottles. 
Along the west wall are large casks and bar 
rels. Several casks have been smashed open 
and their contents drained. Suddenly, 
from behind a stack of barrels, a huge 
bear-like creature with the head of a giant 
owl appears and staggers toward you. 


The creature is an owl bear (AC 5; HD 5; hp 30: 
MV 40'; #AT 3; D 1-8 each; Save F3; ML 9; AL 
N). It is completely drunk and ravenously hun 
gry. If not fed immediately it will attack. It 
attacks at - 2 to hit, but its morale is 10. If both 
paws hit the same opponent in one round, the 
owl bear will "hug" for an additional 2-8 points 
of damage. The room contains 400 bottles of 
wine worth a total of 100 gp. 

55. PARTY ROOM 


Nine men and women in bright costumes 
and fancy masks are drinking, talking, and 
dancing in this room. It appears to be a 
masked ball. Most of the people arc danc 
ing as if they had invisible partners. You 
hear snatches of conversation, most of 
which makes no sense. The people seem to 
be talking to themselves. 


These nine people are Cynidiceans (AC 9; 
NM; hp 4 each; MV 40'; #AX l; D 1-6; ML 
special; AL C). As usual, the Cynidiceans are 
in their own dream world. They will assume 
that the characters are merely pan of the 
dream. There is no treasure here. 

56. CRASHING WALLS 


A hidden pressure plate in the center of 
the hall triggers this trap. The walls just 
ahead of the party crash together and fly 
apart. The trap is automatically triggered 
the first time the party passes. 


This trap has two purposes. First, it alerts Darius 
in room 58 that someone is coming. Second, it 
will be a dangerous hazard to a parry leaving 
room 56a if everyone forgets it is here. (In this 
case it is triggered by a Id6 roll of 1 or 2, and 


110 









INTERLUDE H 


does 3-18 points of damage to characters behind 
the triggering character). The pressure plate will 
be easily seen and avoided if the characters are 
looking for it on the way out. 

56a. LOBBY 


Ten Cymdiccans wearing dark robes and 
masks of fearsome, imaginary monsters sit 
in a circle in this room. They arc staring 
straight ahead, but don't seem to be look 
ing at anything in particular. 


The Cynidkeans (AC 9; NM; hp 4 each; MV 40'; 
#ATl;D 1-6; ML special; AL C) are in their own 
dream world. These particular Cynidkeans. how 
ever, are in nightmare worlds. They will react to 
party actions, and may even attack the party, but 
the Cynidkeans will never speak, even if they arc 
wounded. They might scream at random from 
some unseen terror. This screaming, however, will 
not match reality (that is, they will not scream if 
touched or attacked). 

57. GAMBLING ROOM 


A dozen brightly robed men and women 
masked as various animals arc playing games 
of chance. Card games arc being played at one 
table, dke games at another. In the center of 
the room is a large wheel of fortune. Many sil 
ver and gold coins, gems, and pieces of jewelry 
arc changing hands as people win and lose. 


Because they arc sharing a common dream, these 
Cynidkeans act more normally than those in 
rooms 54 and 55. They will continue gambling 
and talking about gambling unless physically 
attacked. They may even invite the party to join 
in. If attacked, they will fight back. They will 
assume that a gang of robbers has broken into the 
game room to steal their money. Further, if the 
party tries to take the money without winning it. 
the clerk and his hobgoblin guards from room 58 
will enter through the secret door in the south wall 
and attack. 

If the player characters want to join the 
games and gamble, the DM may use any sim 
ple system to work out the results. For exam 
ple. the DM and the player might each roll 
ld20. The highest roll wins and the player 
loses all ties. Wagers are set before the dice are 
rolled (a minimum of 50 gp and a maximum 
of 1000 gp are suggested). The characters can 
not win sny more money than is currently in 
this room. If the characters begin winning 
large sums, the cleric from room 58 is likely to 
attack since he considers all the money in this 
room to belong to him-as a priest of Zargon 


he plans to take most of the money as "taxes." 

A character possessed by Demetrius will go 
immediately to the proper wall section and 
stan looking for the secret door. He will know 
his enemy is very close. 

The gambling room contains 3000 sp, 5000 
gp, 26 gems worth a total of 3100 gp, and six 
pieces of jewelry worth 6000 gp total. 

58. CLERIC'S CHAMBER 

This room contains the evil cleric Darius and 
his hobgoblin guards. They will be ready for 
the party to enter, but it is more likely they 
will come charging out of the room as the par 
ty tries to take the treasure in room 57. If the 
pany has tried to steal the treasure, the Cyni 
dkeans in room 57 will join Darius to fight the 
party. Otherwise, these will do nothing unless 
attacked. The forces of Darius include: 

Darius: AC 5; hp 22; MV 20'; #AT 1 at +1, or 
spell; D 1-6 +1; Save C6; ML 10; AL C; S 
13. 19. W 16. D9. Cl3.Ch 14. 

Darius has the following spells: 

1st level: cure light wounds, light** 

2nd level: bless**, silence 15' radius 

3rd level: striking 

4th level: cause serious wounds 

Only if using the D&D Expert rules. 
Reverse if using the D&D Expert rules. 

6 hobgoblins: AC 6; HD 1 +1; hp 5 each; MV 
30'; #AT I; D 1-8; Save FI; ML 8; AL C. 
The DM may change the number of hob 
goblins as desired. 

12 Cynidiceans: AC 9; NM; hp 4 each; MV 
40': #AT 1; D 1-6; ML 8; AI C. 

Suggested spell use for Darius: 

Before melee: bless the hobgoblins (or 
blight the party) 

Round I: silence a pany magic-user. 
Round 2: striking on his own mace. 
Round 3: other spells as appropriate. 

Darius may use spells in different order as the 
fight develops, but he will always use his spells 
as intelligently as possible. 

Except for Darius and the hobgoblins, thetc 
is nothing of interest in this room. 


When the characters no longer wish to adventure 
in the Lost City, they can prepare for the trek over 
the trackless wastes in an effort to reach civiliza 
tion. Take careful note of their preparations and 
award some extra experience if they consider the 
problem of desert survival carefully (such bonuses 
should not exceed 200 XP each, although a very 
good idea-like getting star chans from the Magi 
of Usamigaras-might be worth 100 XP). 

Even with the best of preparations, they will 
not be able to find a map giving Cynidkea's posi 
tion, so their odds of becoming lost remain high. 

The party will be fortunate enough during 
their desert trek not to have any hostile 
encounters, not to have to endure any of the 
common sandstorms. The days will be blaz- 
ingly hot. the nights bitterly cold. 

The third day out, the party will sec a small 
dot in the distance, flying through the air and 
approaching quickly. It turns out to be Amulf- 
and on a flying carpet! The trading in Specu- 
larum has been quite good. When he recognizes 
the party he is delighted. He is going to meet 
Sindar in Specularum and would be more than 
pleased ro take them all with him. The magk 
carpet is special. a secret command makes it grow 
to hold the entire group. 

Once in the air. Amulf cannot resist show 
ing off his new toy. He will put the carpet 
through every violent maneuver he can think 
of. The characters must each make a successful 
Constitution check or become airsick. When 
this bit of sport pales, Amulf will settle down 
and head for Specularum in a fairly straight 
line-he is not above buzzing unfriendly 
humanoids if the opportunity presents itself, 
though. As the group nears Specularum, the 
party should be very glad to get down to the 
(safe!) ground once more. 

Should the pany try to steal the carpet, they 
will discover that they cannot make it work 
properly (erratic maneuvers, tends to roll up 
in flight unless held open, and so on). Also. 
Amulf has had a powerful wizard put a secret 
mark on it so it can be traced if it is ever stolen. 

When the pany nears Specularum, Arnulf 
will set the party down outside the city gates. 

As the adventure in Specularum is the last 
regular adventure in the book, most of the 
characters should be around 3rd-4th level. If 
they are not. you might want to have the 
Immortal. Thcndara, take them to the palace 
of the Silver Princess if they have not been 
there already. If so, go to Interlude E (p.46). 

If the pany ever wishes to return to the Lost 
City. Amulf will know the way.

PREPARING FOR THE 
ADVENTURE 

The Veiled Society is an adventure that takes 
place in the city of Specularum. Player charac 
ters become involved in the power struggles of 
the city. 

Before playing the first encounter, read this 
introduction and the encounter carefully. It is 
not necessary for you to read the entire mod 
ule before you play. The adventure will last 
many nights; read only those parts you will 
play in one session. 

Specularum 

Specularum, the capital of the Grand Duchy 
of Karamcikos, is the most important city in 
the area. Specularum and the Duchy arc ruled 
by Duke Stefan Karameikos the Third. Specu 
larum is the Duke's home, and the trading 
center of his dukedom. About 50,000 people 
live in or very near the city. They are farmers, 
craftsmen, sailors, and traders. 

The city is accessed by a port. The port is 
protected on the seaward side by two long 
breakwaters. A large river east of the city 
allows ships to cany cargos inland to other 
towns of the dukedom. 

The city keeps 5,000 soldiers ready for any 
emergency. The Duke also has an elite troop, 
the Elvenguard, who go on special missions 
and sometimes an as his bodyguard. The 
entire Elvenguard often patrols the forest 
lands to the north. 

Just to the south of the city is the private 
estate of the Duke, managed by a loyal cous 
in. This land is mostly well-tended woods and 
gardens. It is surrounded by a low (15') wall 
The Duke uses the estate as a summer palace 
and hunting preserve. Anyone found on the 
grounds is treated as a poacher. 

Poor workers and petty thieves live just out 
side the city walls. They work oudying farms 
and the Estate of Marilcnev, a holding that 
surrounds the city. The city itself has all stand 
ard services that the characters need; place the 
service businesses wherever you wish. 

The city is a crowded, noisy, unsanitary place. 
It is like the medieval cities of Germany and Ita 
ly. Reading about these cities will provide infor 
mation useful in describing Specularum. 

The streets are very narrow, twisting, and 
dark. There is no sewage system, except for 
trenches in the centers of streets. Pigs, chick 
ens, geese, and goats arc not uncommon in 
the poorer sections of the city. 

Most buildings stand one or two stories. 
They arc made of dried clay brick or mud and 
watde, constructed on a wooden ftame. A few 
buildings are made of stone or fired brick. 
Most businesses are on the ground floor, the 


owner living upstaiis. 

Water is drawn from public wells, or from 
the river when the tide is flowing out. 

Crime and gangs are not uncommon. The 
gangs meet near the city walls and in the 
squalid sections late at night. 

Running a City Adventure 

Most of your adventures have occurred in 
dungeons. This adventure is much different - 
the action takes place in a city. Players will often 
surprise you with their decisions and actions. As 
they become involved in the events of this 
adventure, their characters will go places and do 
things that are not explained here. 

Allow the characters to visit places not 
shown on the maps. Have the player write 
down the name of the place, its location, and 
any important facts about it. If the character 
returns to this place, have the player remind 
you about the important details. This makes 
your job easier and encourages the players to 
pay attention and remember details. 

Characters will also deal with NPCs that arc 
not detailed in the adventure. Do not panic! 
Have fun with your duties as DM - take the 
role of the NPC and play it like an actor. Give 
these people character and emotions. Give the 
players reason for remembering NPCs. Again, 
if the NPC is important, have the player note 
facts about him - where he can be found, 
what he is like, and what he knows. 

THE FAMILIES OF SPECULARUM 
Encounters 

This adventure is divided into a scries of sepa 
rate encounters. All encounters, when linked 
together and played in order, make a com 
plete adventure. The encounters are unlike 
many other DficD* adventures. In these 
encounters, it is likely that the players will not 
always an as a group. Some of the characters 
may side with one family, while others may be 
drawn to another. If this happens, characters 
may find themselves in conflict with each oth 
er. This is allowable; however, do not force the 
player characters into situations where they 
must kill each other. Allow them to escape the 
situation, but do not make it easy for them. 

Some encounters take place on the streets of 
the city. Since the streets arc narrow, muddy, and 
crowded, characters move at normal dungeon 
rates. 

Random Encounters 

There are no random encounters in this 
adventure. If the characters need to find a fair 
ly common person (a street urchin, beggar, 
merchant, etc.), they will not have much trou- 


112 














THE VEILED SOCIETY 


blc. If they want to find a unusual type of per 
son (a cleric, fighter, magic-user, noble, etc.), 
they must go to a place where that person can 
be found (a temple, for example) or spend 
time and money visiting inns, markets, and 
taverns asking questions. If the characters 
want to find or speak to a particularly power 
ful or important person, their chances arc 
almost nonexistent unless they have impor 
tant information or reason. 

The city has several churches, most for Law 
ful clerics. There arc a few Neutral churches, 
but not many people attend. There are even 
Chaotic Churches; these are very secret and do 
not advertise their existence in any way. If the 
charactcts need healing or similar help, they 
may obtain it if their cleric goes to his church. 
Of course, the player characters arc required 
to make some type of offering (anything from 
flowers to magic items) and may be required 
to do some service for the church. 

NOTE: NPC's listed as Normal Humans have 
a - 1 chance to hit and a -1 on saving throws. 
They save as a 1st level Fighter. 

Characters arc healed 1 hit point per day of 
rest. Rest means no fighting, magic using, or 
more travel than within an inn (upstairs, 
downstairs, etc.). 

Radu 

At a still-spritcly 63 yean, Anton Radu con 
trols his family and organization with an iron, 
but hidden, hand. He is assisted by his broth 
er Cartha, his own sons Zweis and Antonito, 
and their sons Theodosius, Emil and Pieter. 

They are also the leaders of the secret Veiled 
Society, which uses terror and crime against all 
enemies. Only some members of the society 
know them as its leaders. 

The Radu family has many contacts in the 
business and market areas of the city. Their 
strong control over the waterfront and wall dis 
tricts of Spemlarum greatly influences the ship 
building and import/export businesses. The 
Radu are attempting to gain control of the 
money-lending institutions and businesses of 
the city so taey may dictate to the Duke. 

Torcnescu 

Once a powerful faction controlling the every 
day business of the city, the Torcnescu Family 
has been weakened by the death of its leader. 
Christoph Torcnescu. It is currently headed by 
his son Alcksandar. a youth of 26. Because of 
Alcksandar's young age an internal squab 
bling (especially between Aledsandar and his 
unde, Boris), the Torcnescu family has lost 
power and followers. 

The family wants to return to its former glory. 


The Torcnescu still have a great deal of political 
influence and discreet control of "The Hill." the 
noble district of town. Others siding with 
Torcnescu include Lady Magda. Yarns (one of the 
Duke's Privy Councillors), and "Lord" Dimitros 
(the self-styled prince of beggars). 

Vorloi 

Considered by the other factions to be an 
upstart, the Vorloi family has refused to fit the 
political mold. The faction is openly controlled 
by Baron Vorloi. Drawing on his resources as a 
successful merchant prince, Baron Vbrioi main 
tains a fleet of merchant ships in defiance of the 
Radu family. He resists all their attempts to con 
trol his business (or the businesses of those who 
side with him). The Torcnescu are no more 
pleased with the Vorloi. since the Baron refuses 
to side with them simply because the Torcnescu 
represent nobility. 

Vorloi prefers that he and those who side 
with him be left alone. He has been able to 
maintain privacy through his influence in the 
military circles around the Duke. He hopes to 
gain more power and wring important trade 
concessions from the Duke. To reach this goal, 
he tries to prevent open strife and silence any 
bad news that might reach the Duke. Prevent 
ing any problems keeps other families from 
gaining favor from the Duke. 

Other members of the Vorloi faction 
include the Baron's daughter Marianna. Mikel 
(the Commander of the Guard Phorsis). and 
Admiral Hyraskos. He also has a son, Grygori. 
Unfortunately, the boy is simple-minded and 
foolish, much to his father's disgust. 

THE FESTIVAL OF LUCOR 

Aatoa Radu leaned forward, resting his bony 
aims on the table. He looked carefully at the 
others - Zweis, Antonito, and Cartha - try 
ing to guess their hidden doubts. "It is true 
that Lady Magda will be in the festival?" 

"Yes. father," Zweis quickly said. "She is to 
lead the Parade of Maidens from the castle." 

"The members have been informed. All 
will be ready." Cartha softly mmbled. 

"And our friends. Antonito. do they sus 
pect?" 

"My spies report nothing, Father. No one 
suspects." Antonito quickly dropped his gaze 
from his father's eyes. 

"Very good. Then at the Festival of Lucor. 
we will proceed." 

Entering Specularum 

The player characters enter the city for the first 
time. This encounter will acquaint the players 
with the city and how things arc done here. It 


also encourages the players to join different 
sides of the power struggle. Allow the players 
to ask questions and learn about their sur 
roundings as they play. Be ready to create 
answers to common questions: Is there an inn 
nearby? How much docs it cost? What time of 
day is it? 


The gate is open. A few soldiers with spears 
lounge near the entrance. They wear tab 
ards of red and blue with a device of a ship 
on the front. Beyond the gate is a narrow 
muddy street. It is choked with people. 
Most dress in their best clothes and many 
wear brightly-colored outfits. Jugglers and 
fire-eaters are scattered throughout the 
crowd. The noise from whistles, drums, 
singing, and happy chater make normal 
talk difficult. 

"Halt! Do you wish to enter Spccu- 
larum?" shouts a guard inside the gate. 
"The tax is 8 silver pieces, each of you. All 
but daggers must be bound with cloth. 
Unbound weapons are fined. Murder by 
unbound weapon is punished by confisca 
tion of property, or death for the landless. 
Interference with the Duke's men gets you 
prison. Treasonous activity is especially 
nice - it gets you one day of slow torture 
and then we draw and quarter you. So 
enjoy yourselves." 


The guard appears quite bored. He tries to 
watch the festival out of the comer of his eye 
as the characters talk to him. He recites his 
speech from memory, becoming interested 
only when he begins talking about the pun 
ishments doled out for crimes. 

The guard collects the tax from the player 
characters (3 sp of the 8 goes into his pocket). 
He checks all weapons to see that they are 
secured. He lashes swords with thongs and 
wraps spears and the like with rags. It will take 
characters one round to remove the bindings 
from their weapons. After binding the weap 
ons, the guard forgets about the characters 
and turns his attention back to the festival. 
The guard has lived here all of this life and can 
answer most questions asked about the city 
and what is going on. 


Beyond the gate swirls a crowd of people. 
Mud churned up by stumbling dancers 
cakes on the crowd's boots. People jostle 
each other, straining for a look at acrobats, 
knife-throwers, dancing bears, and min 
strels, The smells of sewage, grilled meats, 
breads, sweat, and wine mingle in a 
strange, but inoffensive odor. 

Suddenly, the crowd sways to the sides of 


113 




THE VEILED SOCIETY 


the street. The music fades and changes to 
bells and chanting. Statues carried by sev 
eral men seem to float above the heads of 
the crowd. A sedan chair, borne on the 
shoulders of clerics, follows. 

"The procession is coming!" shouts a 
young boy. 


Advancing toward the gate is the Procession of 
Lucor. The procession is a religious celebration 
honoring a legendary local cleric named to the 
harbor, where the statue of Lucor is floated 
out to sea. Each year a woman of notable rank 
and importance leads the procession. This 
year Lady Magda, a member of the Torcnescu 
faction, has this honor. 

The festival is of great importance. This fact 
well suits the Radu - if the festival has prob 
lems, problems that look like they were 
caused by the Torcnescu supporters, the 
Torcnescu would be disgraced. 


The procession stops. Something is hap 
pening at its front. Three men are arguing. 
A general hush falls over the crowd as 
everyone moves back from the procession. 
Two men, one small, plump, and pock 
marked and the other tail and lean, are 
arguing with the lead bearer of the sedan 
chair. 

Angrily,the small, plump man says to 
the lead bearer, "Bald-headed fool, do you 
Torcnescu think you own the street? 
There's space for all of us, without your 
apc-Likc behavior!" 

The lead bearer comtemptuously waves 
a rod in the small man's face. "Out of the 
way of the Procession of Lucor, Radu rab 
ble!" 

The tall, lean man, spitting on the 
statue of Lucot says, "That old fool? You 
make me laugh!" 

The lead bearer strikes the tall man, 
knocking him into the filth. The smaller 
man tenses, ready to lunge. 


If the player characters act. they can prevent 
violence. If they favor the two men, the Radu 
seek their following. If they side with the 
bearer, they are sought by Torcnescu sup 
porters. Stories of the incident circulate the 
city. If the characters continue to watch with 
out becoming involved, two men in green liv 
ery break up the argument and pacify both 
sides. These men are Vorloi servants. 

After this scene, the characters can learn more 
about the families by asking any of the people 
there. Some will reply neutrally, while others 
fiercely support one faction or the other. Once 
the incident is over, the procession moves on. 


Finding a Room 

When the characters decide to get rooms 
(remind them by asking where they intend to 
sleep), they find all inns very crowded. Wher 
ever they ask. only one room is available, a 
tiny thing that cannot hold more that 3 peo 
ple. If they want it, they may have the room 
for 1 gold piece per person. Point out that oth 
er characters might be able to get a room for 
everyone, but it means that several characters 
must sleep at another inn. If the characters 
refuse to take any rooms, they must spend the 
night sleeping in the mud of the streets. 

When the characters pay for their rooms, 
tell one of the characters that some of his 
money is missing. He has been pickpocketed. 
Not much should be missing, only enough to 
remind the characters to be careful. 

During the evening, one of the following 
events will happen to each player character or 
group of characters. If possible, do not have the 
same event happen to all the characters. The first 
event should be used for fighter and strong 
looking characters, the second for thieves or a 
character standing outside the inn. 

First Event 

Read the following to strong-looking charac 
ters as they relax inside an inn. 


The citizens have finally slowed their cele 
bration of the festival, although it has tak 
en much time, food, and strong drink. 
From nearby in this smoky common room 
comes a loud, tipsy voice. 

A scarred man points. "Hey you there! 
Want some work? Here, sit and drink. I 
need strong bodies. Theosius is my name. 
You look brave. Do you want to earn 
money?" 


Theosius explains that he is looking for trust 
worthy people to perform occasional duties for 
him. None of the missions involve doing any 
thing illegal, but there may be danger 
involved. He will press very hard to get the 
player characters to seal the bargain. If they 
do. as a sign of good faith. Theosius gives each 
player character who agrees 3 gp. He will get 
in contact with them when they are needed. 
(Theosius will attempt to contact the players 
in the "EMPLOYMENT" section.) 

Theosius works for the Torcnescu and so do 
any player characters working for him. If the 
player characters ask about him. they learn 
that Theosius is a respected wood sculptor and 
craftsman in the city. It is known that he docs a 
great deal of work for the nobles of the city, 
and it is rumored he has a small hoard of 
money. 


Second Event 

Read the following to a thief or character 
standing just outside the inn. 


Outside the inn, a man walks by. He lurch 
es drunkenly along. He smiles and nods as 
he passes. Suddenly, three hooded men 
step out of the shadows and the drunken 
man turns around. None of the men carry 
weapons openly. 

"So. new to town, he?" asks the drunk 
en man, who now appears quite sober. 
"You look like you need some work. Now. 
we have some things that need to be done 
and you look fairly smart. I'm sure you 
would want to help us. You staying here?" 
he asks, pointing to the inn. "Be a real 
good idea if you didn't leave for a while. 
We'll see you tomorrow night. Here, 
catch." he says. He throws a small bag. 

With that, the men slip into the 
shadows and run away. The bag holds 20 
gold pieces. 


The men are members of the Veiled Society of 
the Radu. If attacked, they immediately run. 
However, the Veiled Society will treat the 
player characters as enemies from then on. If 
the characters ask about these men. NPCs 
answer evasively. The people do not like talk 
ing about the hooded men. If they ask the 
innkeeper, he explains, that he has a quiet 
business and likes the idea of it staying quiet. 
He doesn't create trouble and no one creates 
trouble for him. 

If the characters attempt to go to the 
authorities, it does not help them. City offi 
cials will shuttle the player characters to differ 
ent officials - the magistrate sends them to 
the warden, the warden to the constabulary, 
the constabulary to the bailiff, the bailiff to 
the magistrate, etc. The PCs will not fin help 
- not because of fear, but because of 
bureaucracy, protection, and bribes. None of 
the officials are evil. 

After meeting the members of the Veiled 
Society, the player characters are watched dis 
creetly by the innkeeper, merchants, and 
members of the Society. If a player wishes to 
determine if the party is being watched, hav 
him roll 1 d6 and add all wisdom bonuses. H 
notices someone watching if the result is 5 
higher. The player characters can attempt 0 
lose anybody trailing them, but will not knr 
if they succeed. They will not succeed. 

UNDER THE FLOORS 

Zweis nervously looked ar the others a round 
the table. Antoaito casually studied his fin 
gernails. Anton, hunched beside a candle ,

THE VEILED SOCIETY 


dipped through papers. "Zweis looks a bit 
uncomfortable," thought Cartha. "Good." 

"So, it didn't work as you planned." Anton 
said, fixing a sharp eye on Zweis. "A feeble plan 
and it didn 'r work. What do we do now?" 

"Make a statement," Antonito said, grinning. 
"A knife in the night would teach the \brloi 
peach-makers a lot. The members are impatient. 
They want to act. no mote little work." 

Anton looked at him calmly, "I then 
assume you would lead them? We must be 
cautious. There will be no more mistakes. 
Cartha. what do you say?" 

"No. we cannot" said Anton finally, "his too 
soon. There is no more to say Goodnight, see 
yourselves out." Anton stood and held out a 
trembling arm to Zweis. The younger man took 
it and they both shuffled out of the mom. 

"Well, what do you feel in your heart?" 
asked Cartha. "The merchant Fortunato is 
where l would start, Antonito." 

Antonito looked to the closed door. "1 
agree. When shall it be done?" 

At the Inn 

If the characters gather at one inn the next 
morning, read the following. If the group 
docs not gather in one place, read the follow 
ing to either group. 


It is morning at the inn. A cat stalks some 
thing in the comer of the room. The inn 
keeper's daughter sweeps last night's 
dinner off the floor. From the back comes 
the clicking of dishes and the splash of 
water. A traveller snores loudly in the cor 
ner. Suddenly, the door swings open and 
an elderly lady frantically looks about. 

"Please, some kind sir, come quick to 
help me!" she pleads, panic overcoming 
her. She looks about for anyone to answer 
her. "Oh save me! There are demons in my 
house, 1 know it! 1 hear them at night talk 
ing to each other. They want to catch me 
please!" she says, falling to her knees. 

The innkeeper runs in. kneels beside the 
old woman, and tries to comfort her. 
"Goodwife Thanato," he says, sounding 
concerned, "what are you doing? Sit down 
proper." He turns, saying, "Could anyone 
help this poor old woman? Could anyone 
look in her cedar to find the problem?" 


If the party docs not ignore the hysterical 
woman, she clings to them, telling her story. 
Something, she swears, is in her root cellar. 
She can hear it moving about - sometimes 
during the day, but mostly at night. Things 
are moved and food is missing. Just minutes 
ago was the worst. This time she heard voices 
and they were calling to her. She begs for the 


party's help. Behind her, the innkeeper qui 
etly holds up a gold piece and points to it. 

If the party still refuses to help, the innkeeper 
leads one character aside. "I'll throw you into 
the street, heartless dogs, and spread your names 
as debtors to all the inns in the city, too, if you 
don't calm this old lady's nerves! Don't think 
my guild can't make you miserable." 

The old woman leads the characters to a house 
a few feet away from the inn. She shows them 
the entrance to her root cellar. It is a trapdoor at 
the back of the kitchen, beside the brick and 
plaster oven. She refuses to go any further. 

1. Under A Garden 


A large earthen cavern is covered with a 
pool of ankle-deep mud. The room is criss 
crossed with supporting beams and planks 
cover the roof. Large blobs of mud seep 
down between the cracks. Across the 
chamber, three thin and naked men shovel 
by the light of a feeble lantern. Three ugly, 
armored creatures watch them work. 


If the characters enter the chamber, one of the 
workers drops his shovel and runs toward the 
characters. The hobgoblins shout foul curses 
at the characters and charge.

C; carry 3 sp each 

If the characters defeat the hobgoblins, the 
naked men rush forward and fall at the charac 
ters' feet and thank them profusely. The men 
were captured almost a year ago and have 
been digging tunnels under the city ever 
since. The naked men do not fight, but do not 
leave the characters until the party goes to the 
surface again. 

2. Fortunato's Cellar 


A light wooden panel covets a dimly lit cel 
lar. The air is dry and smells of meats. 
Cured hams and sausages hang from the 
beams. In the center of the cellar, two 
hooded men busily dig up the floor. A 
large bundle lies nearby. 

"Come on," says one man. "1 think this 
is deep enough. Let's get it buried and go." 

"No," says the second man. "I want to 
make it deeper. Nobody can ever find this 
but us." 


If the men arc not disturbed, they dig a little 
more and load the bundle into the hole. They 
fill the hold with dirt, move some items over 
the spot, and then leave the cellar. If the play 


ers reveal themselves, the two men attempt to 
flee. In the bundle is the body of a young 
woman, recently murdered. See "The Investi 
gation," for information about the woman 
and the house above. 

The men advise the characters to release 
them, if captured. Otherwise, they say, mem 
bers of the Veiled Society will harm them. 
Lawful charactets should not allow the men to 
be murdered. They must turn the murderers 
in or suffer an alignment change to Chaotic.

3. Kobold Exploration Party 


This dug-out cave is dimly lit by torches. 
From the cave comes the sounds of several 
creatures. In the middle of the room is a 
group of ko bolds struggling to place a 
wooden support beam. One turns toward 
you and begins to jibber. The beam slips a 
few inches and a small hail of din falls over 
the room and the kobolds. 

The tunnel to the room collapses in bil 
lows of choking dust. One of the kobolds 
hisses in common. "Come help us, or we 
will all be trapped!" 


If the characters assist, the kobolds let go of the 
beam when the characters approach. A success 
ful initiative roll allows the charactets to grab the 
beam. If they are unable to grab the beam, the 
ceiling collapses, doing I hp of damage to each 
PC. The characters can free themselves from the 
rubble in one round. The kobolds attack while 
the characters cannot fight back. 

The cavc-in behind the characters can be 
dug clear in one turn. Near the beam are sev 
eral kobold-sizcd tools, a bag of spoiled food, 
and a small pouch containing 3 gp.

4. Refuse Pit 


This small side passage recks of foul odor. 
The walls are slimy and oozing. 

A sudden scraping noise is followed by a 
loud, wet plop. A wave of sulphurous 
fumes fills the passage. 


The characters find themselves knee-deep in rot 
ting. runny garbage from an inn. An old cistern 
above the room has collapsed. There is now a 
hole in the ceiling where it has collapsed.

5. The Good wife's Cellar 


At the bottom of the ladder is a dry din 
cellar. Bags are piled against the walls, and 
cobwebs fill the corners. A sack of dried 
apples is spilled across the floor. 

A squeaking and scratching noise comes 
from the southeast comet. 


If the party turns to look, they sec a big rat run 
along the wall and scuttle out of sight If the 
characters follow, they sec a shadow move in 
the southwest comer of the root cellar. Careful 
investigation of the corner reveals a hidden 
entrance to a small passage. Characters taller 
than a halfling must stoop to use the passage. 


A clattering noise and whispery sounds fill 
the room, but there is no apparent source. 


If the characters listen carefully while moving 
about, they find it is loudest in the northwest 
comer. Careful examination reveals another 
small passage behind a sack of grain. Charac 
ters taller than a halfling must stoop to use 
passage, also. 

6. The Unburied Dead 


This chamber was apparently once the cel 
lar of a house. It is now choked with rub 
ble, burned beams, and din. Several paths 
can be carefully picked across the room. 

A chuckling sound continually echoes 
throughout the room. A glowing light, tak 
ing the vague form of a person, floats about 
the room. It passes through beams. The 
sound seems to come from it. The form 
passes through a wall and disappears from 
sight. 


If the characters search the rubble, they find 
pieces of bone, perhaps once a person. As 
soon as the bone is found, the glowing light 
and laughter comes again. Whether the char 
acters strike at the light or not. it does not 
harm them. Hidden under a loose beam, in a 
charred box, are 3 pieces of half-melted jew 
elry worth 200 gp each. 


A faint sliding sound follows a loud snap 
ping. 


The legs of three characters (determine ran 
domly) arc grasped. Roll for surprise. The 
gripped characters arc thrown to the floor as 
three zombies burst up from the rubble- 
coveted floor.

7. Turano's Cellar 


Along the south wall of this cellar is a large 
pile of din. Near the open tunnel mouth is 
a small wheelbarrow. It is loaded with 
shovels and picks. Wooden beams are piled 
neady in the center of the room. In the 
southeast comer is a ladder leading to a 
trapdoor in the ceiling. 

There is a scraping of wood on wood. A 
ray of light shines into the room from a 
crack in the ceiling. Someone is opening 
the trapdoor. 


A hooded man comes down the ladder. He is 
not expecting anyone, but notices characters 
in plain sight. If he notices the characters, he 
flees. If not, he takes a shovel and goes up the 
tunnel to room 2. He is a member of the Veil 
ed Society. He knows the tunnels are being 
dug to enter the houses of their enemies. See 
"The Invcstigarion," for information about 
the building above.

INVESTIGATION 

If the characters discover the murdered wom 
an and report it to the authoriues, they are 
held for questioning. The characters have no 
difficulty proving their innocence if they agree 
to an examinadon by a clerical tribunal. If the 
characters do not agree, they are considered 
guilty and hanged in a week. 

If the murder is not repotted, a servant of 
the Vorloi house discovers it the same day. He 
finds the tunnel leading to the widow's base 
ment. The widow tells about having the char 
acters investigate and their dcscripuons are 
circulated. If the characters do nothing spe 
cial, they arc arrested immediately. They can 
prove their innocence as explained above. If 
the characters hide, they are contacted by 
members of the Veiled Society. They offer 
food, shelter, and safety in return for service. 

The murdered woman is Lucia Vorloi, a 
niece of Baron Vorloi. It is said she spumed 
the advances of Stephanos Torenescu, rudely 
insulting him for his pompous and conceited 
behavior. Examining the body shows the 
woman was strangled from behind, possibly 
by a rope or thick cord. She has no other inju 
ries on her body. Under her fingernails arc a 
few strands of red hair Lucia Vorloi is blond. 
Stephanos has light brown hair. On her right 


check and palm is dried blood. 

After proving their innocence, the charac 
ters are ordered to accompany a tribune (a 
high level fighter) to the scene of the crime. 
With them arc two important clerics of the 
city. They start by going to the Vorloi House. 

Vorloi House 

A well-to-do merchant, Fortunato Vorloi, and 
his daughter Lucia live here. Fortunato has 
been at sea for several weeks now. The house is 
empty. Inside there are signs of violence - a 
dagger and bloodstains on the floor, broken 
dishes and furniture, and tom clothing. 

Several drops of a brownish liquid arc scat 
tered amongst the bloodstains. If the liquid is 
tasted, it proves to be a particularly strong 
type of wine. Several items of value (jewelry, 
money, etc.) are obviously missing. None of it 
is traceable. 

If the characters carefully examine the 
bloodstains, they find a small section where 
the stain seems to have been rubbed away. 
Something may have been written there. It is 
hard to tell but the letters could be BAD .... 
BAO .... RAD.... RAO.. . The message is 
obviously incomplete. 

The daggger is crusted with dried blood. A 
few strands of ted hair are dried in the blood. 
Near the cellar entrance is a signet ring of the 
Torenescu family. A short length of blood 
stained hemp rope lies neat the trapdoor. 
Careful examination by a character looking for 
clues reveals small bits of pitch stuck to the 
rungs of the ladder. 

Turano's Guest House 

This house is deserted, although someone was 
living here recently. It is a small building at 
the rear of a larger house owned by Turano. a 
butcher. He rented the house to a man named 
Skevlos. a black-haired, portly young man 
who was a travelling blacksmith. Skevlos left 
the house the day before. 

The small house has no furnishing other than 
an old bed, a desk, and one chair. Muddy tracks 
on the floor lead to a trapdoor. On the desk is a 
near-empty bottle containing a thick brownish, 
sweet, strong wine. There is no label on the bot 
tle. but near the top is the remains of a wax seal. 
This seal still dearly bean the imprint of the 
Trouscan Estates. Anyone in the city can identify 
the seal, even though the Trouscan Estate is not 
local. All wines from there are sold to a few 
waterfront inns. In the desk is a black leather 
hood. Strands of ted hair can be found inside the 
hood. 

The trap door leads to a cellar Digging imple 
ments, beams, and piles of dirt cover the cellar 
floor. The tunnel entrance is collapsed but the 


116 








THE VEILED SOCIETY 


secret entrance is not. In one comer of the 
room is a mound of bloody bandages. Slipped 
down between the beams is a roll of parch 
ment, a map of this area of the city. Several 
buildings have crosses marked on them. 
Marked are this house. Fortunato's house, the 
Rattlebone Inn, Zwcis Radu's house, and Bar 
on Vorloi's guest house. A careful search of 
these places shows that no tunnels exist other 
than those already found by the PCs. 

The Actual Events 

Lucia Fortunato was alone in her father's 
house. Late at night, two members of the Veil 
ed Society, acting under Antonio's orders, 
entered the house through the cellar to kill 
Lucia. They made noise moving about the 
first floor, awakening Lucia. She came down 
to investigate and discovered the men. Seeing 
them, she attempted to escape and get help. 
The men caught her. She slashed one with a 
dagger she carried. While she was fighting 
him, the other got behind her and strangled 
her with the rope. The two men fled in panic, 
leaving her lifeless body on the floor. Antoni- 
to, on hearing their report, ordered them to 
return to the house and dispose of the body. 

The two men were recruited from the wharf 
area of the city. One man was a ship builder 
and left faint traces of pitch on the ladder. The 
red hairs were from the man Lucia slashed. 

RIOT 

Canha looked hard at Antonito, who sat smiling 
coniidendy. 'TO be all right." Canha thought, 
"so long as that worthless rat of a nephew keeps 
his mouth shut. The litde fool doesn 't even real 
ize the trouble he's in. I do not need to concern 
myself with Zweis for now." 

Canha watched as Anton leaned back in his 
chair. "Mygod," thought Canha. "he'ssmil 
ing. Does he approve of Antonito? What's he 
up to? Well, I best find out." Canha glared at 
Anton and fmally said. "So brother, you 
called us here. Please explain. I'm very busy." 

"I will get to you in due time. Canha." 
Anton said pleasandy. "First, I would like to 
talk about Antonito." 

"Antonito is still smiling." thought Canha. 
"What is he up to?" 

At the menuon of his name, Antonito's 
smile wavered a linle. "Ah, now he's wor 
ried," Canha decided. "Good. Maybe brother 
dear will crush him. That would suit me well." 

"Antonito, there was a killing a few nights 
ago. Did you know that?" Anton leaned for 
ward. 

"Yes, father, 1 beard." 

"Ah, you heard. Indeed. I'm sure you did. 
Are you such a fool to dunk that I would not 


know! Only because you are my son do you sit 
here! Only because you are my son will you 
walk our of here today! You may have mined 
our plans. Now we must fix your mess." 

Anton turned to Canha. "What about 
you?" Canha flinched, thinking he was 
doomed. "Can you correct my headstrong 
son s error?" 

"He doesn't suspect me. Maybe I can con 
vince him to do what I want." Canha thought. 

"Anton, there may be those who will talk," 
said Canha. "They must be found and dealt 
with. Then there are others asking questions. 
The authorities we can satisfy, but others may 
dig too deeply. This must be prevented. And 
arrenn'on must be divened from the Society. 
Let us do what we can to stir up trouble for the 
Torenescu." 

Anton leaned back, the tension slowly leav 
ing his face. "Good," thought Canha, "he's 
thinking about it. Go with it. Anton, do what 
1 want you to." He forced a small smile. "Now 
with Zweis and Antonito in shame, you will 
depend more and more on me," he said to 
himself. 

"Yes, Canha," agreed Anton. "Antonito, try 
to redeem yourself. Find the killers and deal 
with them. Zweis. the public must be made 
aware of the threat the Torenescu poses to their 
safety. Spread the word to them. Canha, you 
will deal with those who ask too many questions. 
I want no more inquisitive noses." Anton stood 
and padded slowly out of the mom. 

Across the table Antonito glared at Canha, 
his eyes showing his hate. 

The Mood in the Streets 

If the characters proceed with their investiga 
tion. they notice a growing mood in the city 
- hotheads speak out against the actions of 
the Torenescu family. They are quick to blame 
the Torenescu for the murder of Lucia Vbrloi. 
Some even accuse the Torenescu of being the 
masterminds behind the Veiled Society. 

These hotheads become bolder as time 
passes. They start by talking among friends in 
inns and taverns, and proceed to gather small 
groups of people. Their voices become louder 
and stronger as more people listen to them. 

By the end of the day, the speakers become 
quite bold. Not only do they connect the 
Torenescu with the murder, they also play on 
the common folk's dislike of the nobility, 
which the Torenescu represent. 

As the characters cross a marketplace to 
return to their inns sometime before nightfall, 
tead the following: 


It is late in the afternoon. Most of the stalls 
have closed for the day. but many people 


arc still in the market. An orator stands on 
the edge of the central fountain. The 
crowd gathers around him. 

The orator shouts, "And I tell you, these 
Torenescu are dangerous. Do they care for 
you? Do they care for the safety of com 
mon workers? Who declares the taxes? 
Who steals food from your children's 
mouths to fatten themselves in luxury?" 

The crowd is getting restless. Several 
men shout cries of agreement. Men raise 
their fists and their voices grow in number. 
The speaker attracts more and mote people 
- some merely curious and others in 
agreement with him. 

The clatter of horse hooves makes the 
crowd turn. 

Ringing the outer edges of the market 
place are 30 of the Duke's horsemen. The 
orator and the crowd glow silent. Three 
riders slowly bring their mounts toward the 
center of the crowd. Suddenly, a hoarse cry 
erupts from the crowd and something 
flashes through the air. The lead rider falls, 
struck by a rock. 


Allow the player characters to move to the 
edge of the crowd, if they wish. They are not 
allowed to cross the line of horsemen. After 
the rider falls, there is total silence for a sec 
ond. Then the crowd surges at the riders. The 
riders respond by drawing swords and charg 
ing As soon as they charge, their line is bro 
ken and the characters can attempt to escape. 

The commoners take up poles, rocks, rotten 
fruit, and daggers. A vicious riot breaks out. The 
horsemen hit the crowd, blindly slashing with 
their sabers. The people respond, swinging sticks 
and hurling stones. Horses, dragged down by 
the weight of clinging peasants, fall with fright 
ened screams. Women, children, and men run 
in panic from the charging riders. 

If a character attempts to escape without 
fighting there is a 30% chance a horseman 
attacks him. The character can continue to 
move and escape, even if hit. 

If the character stays to fight, two more hor 
semen arrive in the next two rounds to assist. 
If these horsemen are defeated, the characters 
and the crowd are not bothered by any other 
riders. After defeating the horsemen, the 
characters are swept up by the commoners and 
hailed as heroes of the common people. The 
characters must think and speak quickly to 
avoid becoming the leaders of the rioters. 

Horsemen: AC 6; MV 40' (on foot); Fl; hp 4; 

#AT 1; D 1-8; Save NM; ML 9; AL L 
The horses have AC 7, HD 2, 9 hp and move 
80'. Six characters working together can pull 
down one horse and rider.

THE VEILED SOCIETY 


Escape 

If the characters break free of the horsemen 
and the riot, they can run down any street they 
wish. All public buildings (inns, shops, etc.) 
on the market square arc dosed and shut 
tered. The characters sec the orator running 
down a side street. No matter what street they 
go down, use the Riot Map. 

If the characters do not follow the orator, they 
encounter a line of 15 soldiers with polearms 
and an officer halfway down the street The 
soldiers advance in an even line, turning back 
any who try to pass. The same thing happens 
on all streets leading to the market. 

A young woman lets the characters in if 
they pound on a door. She hides them until 
the soldiers pass. While they are hiding, the 
characters hear shouting, screams, the occa 
sional noises of fighting, and the harsh cries of 
orders. The air is stale and smoky. After sev 
eral hours, Coelina (the young woman) tells 
the characters that all is clear. They can then 
move on the streets again without fear of sol 
diers. The area of the riot is very still. The dim 
glow of fires rises from that area. 

Soldiers: AC6; MV 40'; HD 1: hp 4; #AT 1; D 
1-10; Save NM; ML 8; ALL 

The soldiers fight whoever tries to break 
through their line. 

If the characters follow the orator, he ducks 
into a small hovel halfway down the street. 
The door slams behind him. Ahead the char 
acters can see the 15 soldiers with polearms 
advancing (statistics above). 

The door is barred, but any two characters 
can break it down. Inside is a bare room (no 
map required) with a trapdoor in the center of 
the floor. The trapdoor opens easily. It drops 
down 10' and becomes a passage running 
roughly northwest. Far down the passage, a 
bobbing glimmer of light disappers. The tun 
nel extends for 300 feet before ending in a lad 
der leading up. 

The ladder leads to a room similar to the 
other entrance. If the characters pursue quick 
ly, they catch the orator in this room attempt 
ing to drag a large chest over the trapdoor. If 
the characters try to capture him, he resists, 
but if they wound him he immediately sur 
renders. Totally panicked, he tells the charac 
ters anything he knows, if they ask. 

He is a member of the Veiled Society. He 
was to stir up trouble for the Torencscu by 
making speeches against them. He does not 
know who leads the Veiled Society. The Veiled 
Society meets in an underground chamber. 
There is a secret entrance in the Blue Water 
Mead Hall near the waterfront. This is the 


only entrance he knows about. He is sure there 
are others. 

There ate normally 20 members present at 
the meetings he attends. All members are 
hooded and robed with clothing provided 
shortly after entering. He provides the charac 
ters with a rough map of the layout, but 
unknown to them it is incorrect. Use the 
Chambers section of the Map 5 to prepare a 
rough sketch for the players, but leave out 
some key details (secret doots. passages, etc.). 
He knows there is a meeting tomorrow night. 

Also, he knows the names of Lucia's mur- 
deteis - Akarios the Shipwright and Zacha- 
riah Boestes. If asked, he tells the characters to 
look at the Blue Water Mead Hall for them.

He carries 200 gp, his pay for rabble-rousing. 

Leading the Riot 

If the characters stay with the rioters, the com 
moners make them the military leaders of the 
riot. In the initial fight, the thirty horsemen 
were defeated. The commoners loot the 
bodies. The characters may commandeer the 
horses if they wish. 

Meanwhile, other commoners gather stones, 
throw bricks at nearby buildings, and collect 
wood for fires. If the characters attempt to 
impose order on the crowd, a large viscious- 
looking thug challenges them. Waving his saber, 
he demands a fight with one of the characters. 
The longer the characters let him talk, the more 
support he gets from the crowd. 

Thug (3rd level fighter): AC 7; MV 40'; F3; 
hp 14; K T 1; D 1-8 + 2; Save F3; ML 12;

He docs not fight fair, using any dirty trick in 
the book he can get away with. 

Fifteen rounds after the characters defeat 
the horsemen. 60 armed soldiers with 
polearms arrive at the square. They have 
orders to stop the revolt by capturing or killing 
those involved. The characters have 100 poor 
ly armed rioters on their side. If anyone is cap 
tured (including the characters), they are 
treated as traitors - slow torture followed by 
drawing and quartering. There is no appeal. 

However, the characters do have a chance to 
fight their way out of the situation. If they 
decide to make an attack on the soldiers, do 
not try to fight the entire combat. Instead, use 
the system below: 

1. Have the characters describe how they want 
the commoners to attack. (Charge the men 


guarding this street; fifty men attack here 
while the rest protect the sides and rear, etc.) 
Have them write it down in the order that it 
will happen. 

2. Have the character with the highest Cha 
risma roll 1-3 and add or subtract his Cha 
risma adjustment. This is the number of 
commands followed by the people, 

3. Let the characters decide where they will be. 
In the front ranks, they are attacked by two 
soldiers each. If in the rear, they are not 
attacked, but the commoners do not fight as 
effectively. 

4. Have the players roll two dice for a morale 
check for the commoners. The morale of the 
commoners is 9. 

5. Roll two dice. If the characters fight in the 
front rank, add two; if not. subtract 1. if the 
characters made a plan and the commoners fol 
low all of it, add two. If the commoners follow 
some but not all of the plan, add one. If the 
characters did not make a plan, subtract 3. If 
commoners foil their morale check, subtract 2. 

If the modified die roll is 5 or greater, the 
commoners have won the fight. There are no 
surviving soldiers present and only 20 com 
moners remain . 

If the commoners lose the fight (a die roll of 
4 or lower), the characters can still escape by 
fighting. The characters must defeat 10 sol 
diers before an escape route is open and they 
may flee. However, vague descriptions of 
them arc sent throughout the city by criers.

After the Riot 

If the characters decide to leave the market 
place after defeating the soldiers, they can 
leave in the general confusion. If they want to 
continue as leaders, they must flee as quickly 
as possible. Each turn ten soldiers arrive. The 
characters can recruit five commoners each 
rum, up to a total of 1,000. No more than 400 
soldiers arrive. However, the player characters 
can never command more than 100 rioters. 
The others run rampant, looting, burning 
buildings and causing much destruction. The 
soldiers stay organized and fight savagely. 
They protect the Duke's castle at all costs. The 
Duke also has access to higher-level magic. 

Describe the scene as general confusion - 
fireballs, screaming, buildings burning, etc. 
Allow the players to continue as long as they 
like, but make it clear that they will not win in 
the long run. Other rioters challenge their 
authority and the players will have little control. 

The Duke immediately begins gathering 
troops from the surrounding area. By the next 
day, he has 2,000 men ready to enter the city.

THE VEILED SOCIETY 


Anyone still rioting or suspected of rioting is 
killed. 

EMPLOYMENT 

As the second day wean on, the tensions of the 
riot slowly subside. The tensions are not gone, 
only hidden, and waiting for a new spark. The 
mood in the dry that evening is grim. 

Read the following secuon to player charac 
ters hired by Thcosius (of the Torcncscu fac- 
uon) when they return to their inn. 


Back at the inn, the innkeeper calls out, 
"Excuse me, but a gentleman called for 
you while you were out. He gave me a mes 
sage, let's sec. Uh, you were to go to ... It 
was to go someplace and get a package, 
that I know. The Senator Eipisdo's house, 
that's where you're to take it. Ah, from the 
Jade Sea, a boat down at the wharf. And 
there was a warning, too, gentlemen? He 
said that there were those who would try to 
take what you carried." 


Characters contacted by the Veiled Society 
receive the following message as they are out 
on the streets. 


From somewhere along the street comes a 
whisding noise and a loud thunk. Quiver 
ing in the wall nearby is a dagger. A shad 
owy figure slips into the crowd and is gone. 
A note ried to the dagger reads: Be at Vin 
ter's Lane tonight before the second bell. 
Go to the wine shop on the comer. Be 
ready. Do not fail. The next message will 
be more pointed. 


The following encounter is for the characters 
headed for the "Jade Sea". 


The "Jade Sea" is finally visible ahead. It is 
late. The sun has set and the remaining 
dusklight is filtering out of the sky. The sea 
wall and the city are behind. The deck 
hand. a wizened old man, does not look 
friendly. 

He snaps in a screechy voice, "What do 
you want? Who sent you here?" 

Whether the party answers him honesdy or 
not, his mood changes and he becomes very 
helpful. 

The old man scampers off. In a few min 
utes he returns with another man. The 
deckhand grins and nods. 

"Here's your package, mateys! Hee-hee, 
have fun, y'lubbers!" 


"1 am Simion Torenescu," says the other 
man. "I am a statesman. It is important 
that 1 reach the Senator's house in secrecy. 
Since you are new to town, you will not 
draw the attenrion his bodyguards would. 
Will you help?" 

Suddenly, a number of ragged-looking 
men approach the base of the gangplank. 
The men carry swords and clubs, but do 
not raise them. One man steps forward 
and kneels on one knee. 

In a slightly mocking tone he says. "Oh 
Lord Simion. our sovereign master Prince 
Dimitrios. Ruler of the Beggars, sends us 
as his solemn oath of homage to the 
Torenescu. Receive us into your service." 

At this, Simion laughs uproariously, 
clapping his hands and stamping his feet. 

"Well said, dog of a beggar," says 
Simion. "And so you shall join my body 
guard!" 


If the characters try to advise Simion against 
taking these men on. he does not listen to 
them. Statistics for these men follow "The 
Ambush" section. 

The party may recommend any route 
through the city they wish. Simion wishes to 
reach the Senator's house as quickly as possi 
ble but settles for a reasonable compromise. 
He has a map of the city. Allow the players to 
see the city map if you wish. There are Veiled 
Society spies on each road. 

Veiled Society Men 

When the characters contacted by the Veiled 
Society reach Vinter's Lane, read the following 
encounter. 


Vinter's Lane is a dark and lonely place this 
late at night. The lane is narrow and foul, 
like most of the smaller streets of the city. 
Small tented booths and little shops line 
both sides. The air smells heavy of yeast 
and wine. Ahead, a lantern shines outside 
a small booth. It is the only place that is 
open. The banner along the side says, 
"Aristo, Wine Merchant." 

The only person in the booth is a fat, 
sweaty old man of about 60. Around him 
arc bottles and jugs of wine. The air has a 
sour-sweet smell. 

"Gentlemen, you have chosen well to 
come to me," says the man in the booth. 
"I, Aristo, am the finest dealer of wines in 
the city! What would you . . ." He stops in 
a fit of coughing and hacking. 

Before he can continue, 10 men appear. 


five at each end of the street. They all wear 
black hoods. They stop 10' away from the 
booth. 


If the characters do nothing, one approaches. 


"Here," says the hooded man, holding 
something out. "Take these and put them 
on. You arc armed? Then come with us 
quickly." 


The men wait for the characters to join them and 
then lead them through many twisting alleys to 
a dark street comer. Here a hooded man, possi 
bly the same one, turns to the characters. 


"You are now one of us," says the man. "If 
they catch you, they kill you. If you betray 
us. we kill you. Act in our name but with 
out our blessing, we kill you. Work hard 
for us and you will prosper. Once with us 
you cannot leave us." 

A boy runs up to the group and speaks 
to one of the men. At his word the group 
runs through the twisting alleys. The 
group arrives at a section of a street. They 
throw hoods over the street lamps. The 
leader of the group morions the men into 
three different positions. 


The Ambush 

The points marked by an "X" on the Ambush 
Map are the three points where the Veiled 
Society men are located. Allow the characters 
involved with the Veiled Society to select 
where they will place themselves. With them 
are five other members of the Veiled Society. 

Play this pan of the encounter in two separate 
groups - one group of characters acting as 
bodyguards and the other group as Veiled 
Society men. Each group should not be 
allowed to hear what is said to the other or to 
know what its members are doing. If this is 
not possible, do not allow player characters on 
one side of the fight to take actions based on 
information known only to the other side. 

Simion, the 10 beggars, and the player 
character bodyguards enter the street from the 
north end. The group may be arranged how 
ever, the players want, so long as Simion is 
protected. 

The Veiled Society player characters receive 
orders to be ready to attack on the leader's sig 
nal. They must attempt to capture or kill 
Simion. He must not be allowed to try to 
make peace among the factions. A good 
description is given of Simion. Simion is the 
only one that matters. The characters may 


119 















THE VEILED SOCIETY 


deal with with others as they see fit. 

When the bodyguard reaches the middle of 
the street, the Veiled Society attacks. All 
attacks made by the Society members are 
intended to reach and kill Simion. If possible, 
they avoid fighting other characters (NPC or 
player). Unless the characters have made prep 
arations, it takes them one round to remove 
their bindings. All NPCs use fake bindings 
that can be removed without loss of a round.

If captured, this man makes a show of resist 
ing and then apparently breaks down. His 
name is Flaviare. He has red hair. He "con 
fesses" that the Torenescu hired him to kill 
Lucia, and that they control the Veiled Socie 
ty. But he is not the murderer. He has no 
wounds other than those he may have 
obtained struggling with the PCs. 

At the end of the fight, if Simion is still 
alive, he continues to the Senator's house. The 
characters escorting Simion are paid 500 gp 
each and sent away. 

If the Veiled Society kills Simion, those 
characters will be paid only 200 gp each. They 
are told they will be contacted as needed. 

FURTHER INVESTIGATION 

After the ambush the characters can continue 
the investigation into Lucia Vorloi's murderer. 
They should have several clues to work with. 
Each clue and where it leads is listed below. 

Red Hair: These arc haics from one of the two 
attackers. Red hair was found under Lucia's 
fingernails and dried in the blood of the dag- 
get she used on one of her attackers. More was 
found in a black hood lying in Turano's guest 
house. As a due it does not provide much 
information to the characters, but it will help 
them identify one of the men. No one in the 


Torenescu family has red hair. No one in the 
Radu or Vorloi families has red hair. 

Pitch: This is common-naval pitch used in 
sealing boats. Some pitch was found on the 
rungs of the ladder leading to the cellar. The 
characters can check for places that have or sell 
pitch. There are 4 major suppliers, all down 
on the waterfront. All have seen at some point 
a red-haired man. They all sell pitch to anyone 
who wants it - fishermen, boatbuilders, 
housewives, etc. 

Blood: The blood is from the red-haired 
attacker. Characters may be able to deduce 
this because the hairs were found mingled 
with the blood. The red-haired man has been 
injured badly as indicated by the amount of 
dried blood found in the Vorloi house. The 
injured man left no trail of blood. 

Ring: The ring is a false due, planted by the 
attackers when they returned. If presented to 
the Torenescu, it takes them a day to deter 
mine who it belongs to. It is the property of 
Stephanos, cousin of Aleksandar. Stephanos 
was the young man spurned by Lucia not long 
ago. He claims the ring has been missing for 
nerly a month. He also has an alibi for the 
time of the mutdet. 

Writing: Lucia was attempting to spell 
"Radu," since she recognized one of the 
attackers as a Radu man when she tore his 
hood off. 

Wine: Wine was found dribbled by the 
bloodstains in the Vorloi house. The wine is 
brought into the city on Radu ships and is sold 
mostly in small inns in the wharf area. Aristo, 
the Wine Merchant on Vinter's Lane. also sells 
this type of wine. If confronted, he gives the 
characters the names of those buyers he can 
remember. The names are Heranthes the Cob 
bler (innocent), Goodman Christos (inno 
cent). Akarios the Shipwright (red-haired and 
guilty), Theodoric Angulsta (innocent), and 
Seraphim the Minstrel (innocent). He says 
there arc undoubtedly others who also buy the 
wine, but he cannot remember. 

Rope: The tope was used in the murder. It is a 
type of rope used in ships and other heavy lift 
ing situations. 

Do not give the information above to the charac 
ters too rapidly. They must discover the meaning 
of the dues for themselves. Confirm obvious 
information (Is this the type of rope used on 
boats?); however, do not tell the characters they 
are correct if their questions arc vague. 

When the characters are at this stage of the 


investigation, it is impossible to know where 
they will want to go in the city. Do not try to 
restrict them. Allow the characters to go where 
they wish, within reason. The only place the 
characters cannot go is the Duke's castle. Fur 
thermore. except for minor assistance, the 
characters cannot get any help from the dty 
officials. Remember, the characters have no 
offidaJ title and are conducting the investiga 
tion on their own 

THE CHASE 

This encounter occurs as the characters make 
their investigations. As they move about, they 
arc indentified by ageats of the Veiled Society. 
Following the instructions of the Radu, the 
Society prepares an ambush for the characters. 
During the encounter, the characters arc not 
able to get help from the constabulary or sol 
diers. All are currently occupied in preventing 
a new riot. If the characters try to get such 
help, make it clear that this will be no use. 

The PCs may dedde to chase their attack 
ers, if these are not killed immediately. It is 
important that you know how fast the player 
characters can move in a round. During the 
chase, if both sides move at the same rate, 
there is only a slight chance the pursuer will 
catch the pursued. Each third round of the 
chase, roll ldlO. On a roll of 1-2, the space 
between the two groups closes by one round's 
worth of movement. Keep track of the dis 
tance between the two sides. There are delays 
in the encounter that expand the distance and 
could allow the NPCs to escape 

Characters may possibly capture the NPCs 
before they teach the secret entrance at E (Map 
6). If this happens, the characters can still 
learn the location of this entrance by ques 
tioning their captive. If all the NPCs are 
killed, the characters will find a message on 
one of the bodies. The message says, "Be at 
the Blue Water Mead Hall tonight." 

Read the following cncoutncr as the charac 
ters head for the Blue Water Mead Hall. 


The sounds of shouting and screaming 
fade, the scene of pandemonium behind. 
The streets arc deserted of all sensible peo 
ple. Suddenly, an arrow flashes past. A 
hooded man is standing on a side street 
and furiously cranks his crossbow for 
another shot. 


Because of the suddenness of the attack, the 
player characters must toll for surprise. If the 
party is surprised, the man fires another shot 
at the group. He continues to do this until the 
characters attack or charge him. He then runs 
in the direction shown on Map 6.

If the characters run after the man, have the 
group roll normally for surprise as they round 
the comer. If the characters advance with cau 
tion, they notice three hooded bowmen, one 
at each of the positions marked by an "X". 
These men arc waiting for the crossbowman to 
lead the player characters around the comer. 

The bowmen shoot once and flee. They do 
not melee with the characters unless forced. 
They run in the direction shown on the map.

B. Booth 

As the last fleeing bowman passes this booth, 
he grabs one of the poles, pulling the fabric 
down. The booth collapses in a billowing 
heap that blocks the path for two rounds. The 
vendor stands next to his booth, screaming 
curses and angrily trying to stop anyone 
around him. 

C. Crowd 

This street is very busy. People fleeing the area 
of the new riot clog the thoroughfare. All 
characters (pursued and pursuing) are only 
able to move at half their normal Running 
Speed while on this street. 

D. Can 

This street has a slight incline. At the top of 
the incline is a fishmonger's can. The fleeing 
men stop at this can and spend one round 
pushing it down the slope. The can moves at 
30' per round. The can strikes a character on a 
die roll of 20. All player characters can be 
struck, unless the character takes a specific 
action to avoid the can. Characters struck by 
the can take no damage, but spend two 
rounds being knocked down and standing up. 
If the characters do not stop the can, it rolls 
into the busy thoroughfare, and plows into 
the crowd. Several people are badly injured. 

E. Guard 


Around the comer is a dead end alley. Your 
quarry is not there, but there is nowhere 
they could have gone. Standing at the fax 
end of the alley is a huge, half-naked man 
holding a two-handed sword. 

The man is the guard from Room 6 of the 


Chambers of the Veiled Ones. He is guarding 
the secret entrance at the end of the alley. If 
the characters do not advance or attack the 
man, he stands immobile. Otherwise, he 
fights to the death. He is mute.

This is the final encounter. If the players han 
dle the encounter correcdy, they learn who 
murdered Lucia Vorloi and who is in charge of 
the Veiled Society. Less successful play will 
only give pan of this answer. 

There are several ways characters can enter 
this encounter. If they have pursued the 
ambushers, they may find the secret entrace to 
Room 6. If they have captured the orator or 
the ambushers, they have information to go to 
the Blue Water Mead Hall. Careful observa 
tion here allows them to find the entrance to 
the Society's chambers. 

1. The Blue Water Mead Hall 


The Mead Hall is a bright, dean building. 
Inside, several sailors in the center of the 
room strike up a rousing but badly off-key 
chorus of a sea chanty. One plays a simple 
bagpipe at a furious pace, near them, ser- 
val men link arms and begin a noisy step- 
dance. Their stomps punctuate the ribald 
words of the song. There is much clatter of 
mugs and talk. The tavern keeper asnd sev 
eral potboys whik through the crowd, 
slamming down drinks and catching 
thrown coins, near the back are two cur 
tained doorways. 


A red-haired man sits near the back of the 
room. If the characters have a description of 
Akarios, they recognize him. If it is near eve 
ning, the man leaves the room, and goes 
through one of the curtained doorways. If the 
characters appoach the man, he springs to his 
feet and runs for the curtained doorway. He 
holds his right arm close to his side.

If the party catches the man and accuses h i m 
of murdering Lucia, he attempts to bluff. If 
the party presents any reasonable proof (true 
or not) or threatens torture, make a moral 
check for Akarios. If he fails the check, he 
talks, saying that the Veiled Society ordered 
him to murder Lucia. He tells about the secret 
entrance to the chambers from the Mead Hall. 

If the party docs not catch Akarios. he 

121 


escapes behind the curtain. 

2. Beyond (he Curtain 


Two men sit on the floor near the curtain, 
playing dice. Both look up curiously. 
Behind the curtain is a short hallway that 
ends in a Dutch door. The top half is open, 
showing the street beyond. 


If the party asks about Akarios. the men point 
to the back door. On the street there is no sign 
of him. The men try to prevent the characters 
from searching the hallway that hides the 
secret passage. One of the men is a cleric who 
casts a silence spell to cover any noise of fight 
ing. The other is a fighter who tries to make 
his first attack when the characters turn their 
backs. After this he fights normally.

3. Robing Chamber 


This chamber is barely large enough for 
two people to stand in. On one wall is a 
shelf piled with red robes and black leather 
hoods. Otherwise, the room is bare. 


The doors to this room are designed to prserve 
the secrecy of anyone robing in the chamber. 
Each door automatically locks when dosed 
and cannot open again until the other door in 
the room is opened and closed. This effective 
ly prevents more than one person or group 
from using the room. 

4. Sirenflower Passage 


The passage forks. From one passage comes 
the faint smell of incense and a faint glow 
of light. The other passage is black. 


The dark passage leads to Room 5, the Meet 
ing Chamber. The passage that smells of 
incense and shines with light leads to a 
sirenflower (see New Monsters). Halfway 
down the passage, the first tendrils of the 
plant grow on the wall. When the characters 
reach the end of the passage, the sirenflower 
closes behind them. In the roots of the

5. Meeting Chamber 

If the characters have not made noise from chop 
ping down doors, loud fighting, arguing noisily 
amongst themselves, etc. and they arc cautious, 
read the following description to them. 


The glow of light and a droning sound 
comes from down the passage. Ahead is an 
archway shining with a red light. 

A large room is gloomily lit by smolder 
ing fires. Standing along the walls of the 
room are 20 men, all dressed in red robes 
and black hoods. At the far side of the 
room is a man wearing a red and gold robe 
and a large wooden mask. His face does 
not show under the mask. He is speaking 
to the crowd in a hollow echoing voice. 
Behind him is a large bronze gong. 

The masked leader booms, "And now is 
our time! The city will lie helpless before 
us! The people will side with us. Out ene 
mies can be crushed. The Duke will feel 
our power, will hear only our voice. Those 
who oppose us are weak, those who betray 
us arc traitors. We know what to do with 
traitors." Shouts of agreement fill the air. 

"Then take him, take the traitor!" he 
shouts, and points to one of the robed men 
"He will suffer for disobeying our orders. 
The woman should not have been killed!" 

At this the other masked men spring 
toward the accused, an inarticulate growl 
of rage in their throats. His screams of pan 
ic rise above all. 


If the characters do nothing but watch, they wit 
ness the horrible death of one of the members of 
the Veiled Society. Lawful characters will not suf 
fer an alignment change, however. Unless one 
character watches the leader, he is gone when 
they look for him again. After the traitor is dead, 
the members rum to leave, one at a time, the 
secret meeting obviously over. Half the members 
leave by the passage to the Blue Water Mead 
Hall. The others leave by the secret entrance that 
leads to the blind alley. 

If the characters act during the confusion, 
the Society members attack them. If any 
member of the party watches the leader dur 
ing the commotion, he sees the leader slip 
behind the gong and disappear. 

The traitor slain by the members was the 
man who assisted Akarios with the murder of 
Lucia. If the characters check his body, they 
find nothing of interest. 

Searching the room reveals nothing of use 
or value.

The leader is Anronito Radu. If captured, he 
tries to place the blame for all events on Zweis 
Radu. 

If the characters did not defeat the guard in 
the alley in the previous encounter, he is in 
this chamber. He is mute and attacks anyone 
he does not recognize. He does not recognize 
the player charactets. He is slavishly loyal to 
the Radu and does not reveal anything about 
them willingly.

The room is unlit and foul-smelling. Straw 
crackles underfoot. There is a shuffling of 
chains from one comer. 


Held prisoner in this room is Estaish. a mem 
ber of the Duke's Elvcngard. He is chained to 
the wall. The manacles are locked around his 
feet and hands. No key is in sight. He is weak 
and has been tortured. He can barely talk. 

If rescued, he shows the party all secret 
doors out of the room. He comes with the par 
ty, but cannot fight and can only walk with 
support. If the characters succeed in getting 
him outside, he accompanies the player char 
acters as an NPC on future adventures. There 
is no question of his loyalty, although he does 
not accept unreasonable orders. He serves the 
characters in the best and wisest manner. 

He has no equipment with him other than 
clothing. His remaining equipment (chain 
armor, sword, and bow) is in Room 8. 

Estaish learned a great deal about the Veil 
ed Society during his imprisonment. He can 
identify the murderer of Lucia Vorloi and 
knows the murder was done on the orders of 
the Veiled Society. He knows that the Radu 
family is involved in the Veiled Society and is 
responsible for inciting the riots in the city. If 
used as a witness to the Duke concerning the 
Radu and the Society, he can destroy the Radu 
as a power faction forever.

7- The Secrer Chamber 


The chamber is brightly lit by hundreds of 
sputtering candles that give the room a 
warm, yellow glow In the center of the 
room is a table piled with books and 
papers. On the floor is an old man. He lies 
face down in a small pool of blood. Stand 
ing over him is a middle-aged swarthy man 
holding a sword to a younger man's chest. 

The younger man shouts, "Stop him! 
He has slain our father! He is a murderer! " 

"Get back you fools or die now!" says 
che middle-aged man. 'T'vc had enough 
meddling and foolishness." He leaps for 
ward to attack you. 


The younger man is Zweis Radu, the middle- 
aged man, Cartha Radu. Cartha will attempt 
to kill the playei charactets. then escape. If he 
is severely wounded, he attempts to fight his 
way past the characters and flee. During this 
fight Zweis assists the characters. 

If Zweis is still alive after the fight, he 
thanks the characters and offers them a 
reward. The reward is a position within his 
organization - the Veiled Society. If the char 
acters accept, those of Lawful alignment will 
change to Chaotic. If the characters refuse, 
Zweis tries to bribe them. He offers each char 
acter 300 gp in jewels from a small wooden 
box in the desk. If the characters still refuse, 
Zweis lets them go and immediately makes 
plans to flee the city. 

If the characters search this room, they find 
3000 gp worth of gems in a small box and 
Estaish's equipment. The dead man on the 
floor is Anton Radu. 

If the characters try to examine the papers 
or take these with them. Zweis attacks. The 
papers are a complete account of the Radu 
family's actions and the Veiled Society.

If the papers arc placed in the hands of the 
Duke or any othet family, all members of the 
Veiled Society and Radu faction arc declared 
traitors and sentenced to death. 

Not all members of the Veiled Society are 
captured. Those that escape learn of the char 
acters' involvement in the family downfall. 
This can be a starting point for adventures as 
the Radu faction tries to take revenge on the 
player characters.

THE VEILED SOCIETY 


AFTERWARD 

After the adventure in Spccularum has been 
completed, it's time to step back and decide 
what to do next. Arc the players happy with 
the course of the campaign? Have the charac 
ters advanced beyond the lower levels of play? 
Have the players mastered the game at this 
levels? Do they want to take a stronger role in 
the development of the campaign setting > 

If so, they will probably want to try the 
D&D(r) Expert adventures for character levels 
4-14. The next adventure recommended for 
the party that has completed this scries of 
adventures and gained 4th level or so is the 
ocean voyage to XI, The Isle of Dread. How 
the characters begin this adventure will be 
decided by how well they did in Spccularum. 
If their faction won, they will be in a good 
position to simply propose the trip to a power 


ful sponsor. If not. they will still have devel 
oped other contacts in the course of their 
adventures-Lirdrium Arkayz, Sindar. Arnulf 
Armbrustcr, and perhaps even the Protector. 
(And they may need these contacts to leave 
Spccularum quickly'.). 

If the characters are not yet powerful 
enough for ocean adventures, and there arc 
still adventures in this series left unpiayed, the 
players can be sent back into them. For exam 
ple. if the party caused the fall of the Radu 
faction in Spccularum, the survivors of that 
faction might arrange 10 have them kid 
napped by slavers (leading to the "Great 
Escape" adventure) or spirited away by desen 
nomads (bringing them to the "Lost City"). 
Likewise, if the player characters' faction has 
lost, they might flee mto the woods, and 
encounter a village of elves with a problem. .. 


If the players enjoyed a certain adventure, 
there is no reason not to use the same setting 
or NPGs as a springboard for more adven 
tures, For example, the hapless Caldwell 
might buy another castle-and have no better 
luck than he did the fust time! A new adven 
ture can also be created by rekeying existing 
maps, changing the location of the complex 
and the denizens found there. Such "new" 
complexes should remain consistent with the 
human, demihuman. and monster popula 
tions for the locale Recognizable territories 
(and even individual tribes) make a campaign 
world more real. 

Finally, for those wanting even more adven 
tures, GAZl, The Grand Duchy of Kara- 
meikos has suggestions for further adventures, 
and future Gazetteers will enable the players 
to do even more!

Archer bushes have sickly-looking green 
leaves, dwarf trunks and thorny brown 
branches. The trunk looks like a 3' tall mound 
of leaves. Hidden under the leaves is a huge 
mouth. Archer bushes are carnivorous and can 
uproot themselves and move slowly towards 
their prey. The mouth is filled with extra hard 
thorns which the bush uses like teeth to 
devour prey once the prey is dead. Archer 
bushes attack by shooting a spray of sevctal 
small thorns at their victims, causing 1-4 
points of damage. Archer bushes can shoot 
their thorn spray at one target up to 20 feet 
away. Each bush can only fire three such sprays 
in a day.

Chameleon men are 7 feet tall and quite thin. 
They have spindly arms and legs, and move 
with a gangly, awkward stride. Their multi 
colored skin has with tiger-like stripes of red, 
blue, green, yellow, brown, orange, black and 
white. 

Each round, a chameleon man can vanish, 
and reappear in another place. It can reappear 
up to 120' from the spot where it vanished. 
This vanishing move is instantaneous. The 
control of this ability is so precise that they 
never reappear in mid-air or inside solid 
objects. However, since the use of the ability is 
instantaneous, a chameleon man cannot reap 
pear in the exact spot where someone else is 
standing when the chameleon man vanishes. 
If several chameleon men use this ability in 
the same area, they all reappear without col 


liding. 

A chameleon man cannot attack in the 
same round that it uses the vanishing move, 
because of the mental concentration required 
to vanish. A group of chameleon men will 
usually use the vanishing move to surround 
opponents. 

The warriors of this race arc usually armed 
with daggers or clubs. They never wear armor, 
since they cannot cany much weight while 
using the vanishing ability. 

Chameleon men usually live in deep 
caverns or in dense forests far from civiliza 
tion.

The crone of chaos is an intelligent, evil- 
narured creature that uses deception to cause 
pain and suffering. In its true form, the crone 
has wrinkled, leathery skin, sparse hair, long 
crooked arms, fangs, and large hands with 
daw-like fingers. It normally lives alone in evil 
forests or desolate wilderness, often in a cave. 

The crone has unusually keen hearing and 
eyesight, and is surprised only on a roll of 1 on 
d6. 

The creature has several magical attacks 
available. These arc natural powers, not spells 
(although they can be revealed by detect mag 
ic and destroyed by dispel magic, a 3rd level 
magic-user spell). The most important of the 
se powers is an illusion power that allows the 
crone to look like a human or demi-human 
character. The crone usually disguises itself as 
a beautiful young woman to fool unwary vic 
tims. In this form it uses the animal control 
and daggers of sorcery powers to attack. The 
crone fights in its true form only if surprised, 
or if the other attacks have failed to destroy 
the opposition. 

The crone's animal control and daggers of 
sorcery powers arc described more fully in 
encounter R2 in The Hall of Rock.

Cynidiceans are a special type of normal 
humans who live in the Lost City. They have 
pale skin, white hair, large eyes, and infravis 
ion. They wear colorful masks, bright cloth 
ing. and carry short swords. The Cynidicean 
have lived underground so long that they have 
a -1 to hit when attacking in full sunlight 
(like goblins). They spend most of their time 
living in strange dream worlds. Special Cyni- 
diccan characters can be set up just like nor 
mal NPCs. More details on the Cynidiceans 
will be found in the DM's Background in the 
Lost City adventure. A dozen encounters with 
Cynidiceans are outlined here. The DM may 
use these or make up his or her own. 

Cynidicean Encounters 

1. One character m a wolf mask (AC 9: NM; 
hp 3; MV 40'; #AT none; ML 7; AL C) is 
encountered. This Cynidicean believes he 
is a werewolf. When he secs the party, he 
will drop to all fours, howl, sniff, circle, 
and generally behave like a wolf. He may 
try to bite if approached too closely. He 
thinks he cannot be harmed, and will only 
be afraid of magic or silver weapons. 

2. Three characters approach the party, 
dressed in dark robes and devil masks. 
They carry incense burners. These Cynidi 
ceans think they arc powerful clerics (AC 
5; C3, C2, Cl; hp 13. 9,4; MV 30'; #AT 1; 
D 1-6; ML 8: AL C). They sec the party as 
demons and will try to drive them off with 
loud cries and foul-smelling smoke. The 
leader's name is Brother Theodcus. 

3. One Cynidicean dressed in bright green 
robes and a bird mask approaches the party 
(AC 9; NM: hp 3; MV 40'; #AT 1; D 1-6; 
ML 11; AL C). She will walk slowly up to 
one party member, hand him or her a 
small pouch, smile, and walk on. She will 
not notice any attempt the party makes to 
talk to her. TTie pouch contains a strange 
powder that smells like cloves. The powder 
has no special properties at all. 

4. Six Cynidiceans in striped robes and camel 
masks zig-zag slowly down the hall in sin 
gle file. They are trying to avoid the invisi 
ble snakes on the floor. They will try to 
show the party the invisible snakes and

warn the party to walk around the snakes. 
There are. of course, no snakes 

5. This party of four wear insea masks, carry 
large clay jars, and hum like bees. They 
will stop and ask the party to drink from 
the jars. Everyone who does has 1-4 points 
of damage cured, as these jars contain hon 
ey from the lair of killer bees. If the Cyni- 
diceans are attacked, or if someone tries to 
drink twice the Cynidiceans will smash the 
jars and attack bcrserklv (AC 9; NM; hp 3 
each; MV 40'; #AT 1 at +2; D 1-6; ML 12; 
ALC). 

6. This party of four wears animal masks; 
Hawk, Fish, Car, and Fox (these are also 
the characters' names). They are carrying a 
stretcher with a gourd on it. These charac 
ters are rushing their 'sick friend' (the 
gourd; Dog ) to a cleric. If the party has a 
cleric, the Cynidiceans will insist that the 
cleric cure their friend. 

7 . This group of six in bright yellow robes and 
human masks will stop and stare at the par 
ty. They will 'recognize' a party member as 
the King or Queen of Cynidicca. They will 
follow the character, sing songs of praise, 
and wait on the charaacr hand and foot. 
In general, they will smother the charaacr 
with attention. However, they will not 
fight for their King or Queen. They arc 
more likely to grab the character and try to 
rush him or her to safety. Thev are: AC 9; 
NM; hp 4 each; MV 40'; #AT 1: D 1-6; ML 
7 ; AL C. Their spokesman is Policrates the 
Herald. 

8. A group of four Cynidiceans in feathered 
robes and bird masks approach. On seeing 
the party, the Cynidiceans will 'fly' (run) 
forward, flapping their arms and squawk 
ing. They will invite the party to fly along 
and will lead them on a merry chase 
through the pyramid. If the party refuses 
to join the Cynidiceans. the Cynidiceans 
will insult the party as poor creatures who 
cannot fly ("Thou land-bound slugs!"), 
circle three times, and 'fly' away. If 
attacked, the Cynidiceans (AC 9; NM; hp 
4; MV 40'; Save: Fl) will 'fly' away. 

9. A group of six Cynidiceans with their 
bodies painted black and wearing vulture 
masks walk quietly toward the party. They 
carry long wooden boards, but seem 
friendly and normal. They will follow the 
party, waiting for something to be killed. 
When it is, they will rush over and start 
building a coffin to fit the body. When 
they arc done, they will demand a 10 gp 


payment. They will attack if they are not 
paid. (AC 9; NM: hp 4 each; MV 40'; #AT 
I; D 1-6; ML 8; ALC). 

10.These five Cynidiceans are a NPC Party. 
They will think the player charaacrs are 
some kind of monster. Turn to the Wander 
ing Monster: Level 2 table in the D&D

looted the city centuries ago. They will flee 
in panic as the party approaches.

The decapus is a creature usually found in for

ing ten tentacles. The hair is usually brown, 
but sometimes it is black. The body is normal 
ly green, although some purple or yellow 
dccapuses have been found. In the center of 
the decapus's 4' wide body is its mouth. The 
mouth of a decapus is terrible to behold. It is 


very wide and has long yellow teeth and a hor 
rible foul breath. 

Decapuscs usually live alone, preferring to 
hunt by themselves. They hunt by swinging 
through trees and scooping up their prey in 
their tentacles. The tentacles are 10' long and 
extend from all parts of their bodies. The ten 
tacles are covered with suckers that the deca 
pus can use not only to grasp prey but to climb 
walls and ceilings. 

The decapus attacks with nine of its tenta 
cles. using the tenth tentacle to hang from the 
ceiling (or trees). 

On the floor or ground, the decapus is 
much more helpless. Its tentacles are not 
strong enough to support its weight upright 
for long periods of time. On the ground, the 
decapus can only manage six attacks, and the 
se attacks do only half normal damage. When 
swinging from tree limbs, the decapus can tra 
vel at 90' per turn, or 30' per round. On the 
ground, the decapus can only move 3' per 
turn or 1' per round,

Wailing feys arc pale ghost-like figures. Their 
shape is roughly humanoid, though longer 
and thinner than most humans. They have 
glowing red eyes and a large, dark mouth. 
Wailing feys are supernatural creatures that 
haunt certain families. They warn the family 
that one of its members will soon die. Wailing 
feys may also mourn for a person after his or 
her death. Thus, they may be found guarding 
graves, catacombs, or tombs. 

Wailing feys can only be hurt by magic or 
magical weapons. They are immune to sleep, 
charm, and hold spells. They are not undead, 
and cannot be turned. Disturbed wailing feys 
attack with a special wail. All those within 30' 
of the wailing fey take 1-4 points of damage 
each round automatically. Doors or walls will 
block the sound. A wailing fey will attack any 
living creature it sees. It will continue to wail 
until it is destroyed or until the intruders have 
run away.

A haunt is a ghost-like spirit of a dead charac 
ter or creature. There is some reason why the 
spirit cannot rest, usually a message to be 
delivered to those who enter the haunted 
area. The haunt cannot be destroyed, only 
laid to rest by some means decided by the 
DM. 

Haunts cannot attack or cause damage, 
though certain haunts may require characters 
to make a saving throw vs. spells or run away. 
Characters who fail their saving throws will 
not willingly go into the haunted area again. 
A haunt always stays in one area.

The lava lizard is a bizarre reptile that dwells 
in subterranean caverns among pools of bub 
bling lava. The creature has a rocklikc outer 
shell that helps to maintain the high body 
temperature a lava lizard must have to sur 
vive. 

The lava lizard fights by trying to bite a 
creature with its quick but relatively weak 
jaws. A bitten creature takes 1-6 points of 
damage from the lizard's bite and must save 
vs. dragon breath. If unsuccessful, the crea 
ture is gripped momentarily by the lava liz 
ard's jaws and takes an additional 1-6 points 
of damage from heat. (For magical types of 
fire resistance such as rings and spells, treat 
the bite as red dragon breath in terms of sav 
ing throws and reduced damage). 

The lava lizard has a special defense as well. 
Whenever the creature is struck by a nonmagi- 
cal metal weapon (such as a sword blade or 
dagger), the owning character must save vs. 
magic wands or the weapon melts from the 
intense heat of the creature's interior. Note 
that a melted weapon still inflicts damage on 
that round, but not thereafter. 

Although these creatures dwell in hot sub 
terranean caverns, they have been known to 
travel several miles from the lava they need to 
survive. As they feel their body temperature 
cooling, they will attempt to return to the 
nourishing fires. There are a few unconfirmed 
reports of lava lizards being found in sta- 
tuclikc immobility, presumably having been 
caught too far from their source of heat.

Wcrefoxes are foxes that can change into 
human form. In human form, the werefox 
will have fox-like red hair and an Armor Class 
of 9. A werefox in human form has the ability 
to charm a person of the opposite sex. This 
ability works like a charm person spell, but 


lasts only one day. In fox form, the werefox 
can chirm immils. The werefox can charm 
any one normal or giant animal for one day. A 
creature or person who saves vs. Spell will not 
be charmed. 

Once a creature or person is charmed, it will 
remain charmed for that day, even if the were 
fox changes form. The charm ability can be 
used only three times per day. For example, a 
werefox could tty to charm two humans and 
one animal in the same day. 

Wcrefoxes arc clever and cunning. They live 
mainly by their wits. If combat is going 
against them they will prefer to trick or bribe 
their opponent rather than fight to the death.

The piranha bird is a one-foot long, garishly 
colored bird always hungry for fresh meat. 
Individual piranha birds may have green, 
blue, red, brown, black, or even purple 
feathers-the entire variety of colors displayed 
in a single flock. Their beaks arc sharp and 
pointed, and have razorlike edges so that the 
bird can stick its beak into the flesh of a crea 
ture, bite, and fly away with a snack. 

Piranha birds can fly with humming 
birdlike maneuverability; they can make sud 
den changes in direction, or even hover in the 
air. When one piranha bird catches sight of a 
potential meal, it utters a high-pitched whis 
tle, thus alerting the entire flock. They always 
attack warm-blooded creatures, and do not 
have to check morale until half of the flock has 
been eliminated. 

They do not like bright sunlight, but 
piranha birds may be found in all climates 
except the very coldest or those barren of any 
shade. They prefer to live in regions of dense 
forest or in underground caverns, and seem to 
have developed limited tnfravision that allows 
them to detea prey up to 30 feet away even in 
total darkness.

The polymar is a semi-intelligent creature that 
can change its shape. It can look like any crea 
ture with 10 hit dice or less, or any object no 
larger than 100 cubic feet (10' x 10' * 1'. for 
example). The polymar gains no special abili 
ties by changing. 

This change ability is physical, not magical 
Thus a detect magic spell will not detect the 
polymar. The change, however, is not perfect. 
Characters, including NPCs, have the same 
chance to detect the polymar as they do to find 
secret doors. Thus, elves are more likely to 
notice polymars than other character classes. If 
the polymar is not detected before it attacks, it 
will attack with surprise.

The sirenflower is a large carnivorous fungus 
that has developed the disguise of a normal 
looking plant. It captures its prey by luring 
creatures toward its center, lb do this, the 
plant emits scents and lights. The scents are 
similar to those near the plant, particularly 
fragrant flowers or rotting meats. The light is a 
pale glowing, no brighter than a candle at its 
best. 

Once a creature reaches the center of the 
plant, a web of branching arms close in, trap 
ping the creature and slowly crushing it. The 
se branches squeeze with great force, causing 
1-4 points of damage per round. In addition, 
the branches also ooze an enzyme that dis 
solves flesh. This is very slow-acting and only 
does 1-10 points of damage each turn (not 
round). Creatures trapped by the sirenflower 


can still fight but have a -4 penalty on all hit 
rolls. 

When the sirenflower reaches 0 hit points, 
it is not dead, but all the branches have been 
chopped away. The only way to totally kill a 
sirenflower is to dig up and bum the root. The 
creature grows back at the same rate as a nor 
mal plant.

Steam weevils are tiny flying insects that 
thrive on the intense heat and pressure of sub 
terranean areas of geothermal activity. They 
have developed a way to turn the heat of a 
pool of lava directly into usable energy (much 
the way plants derive energy dirccdy from the 
sun), and many generations of steam weevils 
will live their lives without ever leaving the 
deep caverns that are their preferred environ 
ment. 

Occasionally, however, because of volcanic 
activity, a swarm of steam weevils may be car 
ried to the outside world in a blast of steam or 
lava. They cannot live long in the relative cold 
of the atmosphere, but they can be a danger 
ous enemy in the 1-4 houts that passes before 
they die. 

Steam weevils glow underground or in 
shade, because of the intense heat of their 
bodies. A person caught in the midst of a 
steam weevil swarm takes four points of dam 
age from bums if the swarm is at full strength. 
Damage is cut in half if the character is ward 
ing the insects away. (See "Insect Swarms" in 
the monster section of the Basic rules book). 
Smoke and fire does not bother steam weevils, 
but water damages them if it is splashed on 
the swarm (roll to hit AC7.) Characters may 
scoop water from a puddle or stream with 
their hands, or they may uncover a water con 
tainer and attempt to douse the bugs that way. 

For each hit to the swarm, the damage that 
the steam weevils can inflict is reduced by one. 
Therefore, if two splashes have hit the swarm 
and it is surrounding a person who is warding 
them off. the swarm docs only one point of 
damage. Note that the swarm can only attack 
one creature or character at a time.

Vampire roses look like normal white rose 
bushes. They can, however, uproot them 
selves to move about slowly. Each 4 HD worth 
of vampire roses represents a single rose bush. 
The thorny stalks of vampire roses can whip 
around a victim, inflicting 1-8 points of dam 
age. The thorns are hollow. Once a thorn stalk 
has stuck and wrapped around a victim, the 
vampire rose will drain 1-8 points of blood per 
round automatically. The vampire rose also 
injects a hypnotic anesthetic into the victim's 
bloodstream, the victim must save vs. Spells 
or lose all willpower, allowing the vampire 
rose to continue sucking blood until the vic 
tim dies. After a vampire rose has completely 
drained a victim, the roses will be colored 
blood red instead of white for one day.

Water weird arc magical creatures made of 
water that live in bodies of water, such as 
pools. They attack all living things that dis 
turb them, feeding on their life forces in some 
unknown way. Water weirds appear in nearly 
any shape, though the form of a giant snake is 
common . 

In combat, weirds attack single enemies 
within 10 feet of their pool. They form from 
the water in 2 melee rounds. Instead of mak 
ing a normal attack, water weirds make their 
victims make a saving throw vs. paralyzation 
(Dexterity bonuses apply). Victims who fail 
their saving throw take damage, and arc 
seized and dragged into the water. When 
weirds trap and drag a victim under water.

NEW MONSTERS 


they ignore other opponents until the trapped 
victim is dead. A trapped character can attack 
the weird with a -4 penalty to hit. Once in 
the water, victims take damage each round 
and must make a saving throw vs. death each 
round or go unconscious. Unconscious victims 
die after 3 rounds unless rescued. 

Sharp weapons cause only 1 point of dam 
age; blunt weapons cause normal damage. All 
strength and magical bonuses apply. Damage 
equal to a weird's total hit points disrupts it, 
but it reforms in 2 melee rounds. Cold slows 
weirds (half movement and attacks every sec 
ond round), but fire-based spells do half or 
none of their normal damage. Purify food and 
water spells kill water weirds immediately. All 
other attacks do not harm them. They may 
retreat to the bottoms or far comen of their 
pools if hard pressed. 

Larger water weirds are possible. For every 
additional 3 hit dice, the weird's AC is 
improved by 2, damage increased by 1, attack 
range in increased by 5 feet, and saving throws 
and trapped victims' attacks made with addi 
tional penalties of -2. 

Witch-Sisters, Three 

The three sisters are unlike any other magic- 
users. in that their powers work in combina 
tion. and require the Black Opal Eye as a 
focus. Individually, they arc weak, but togeth 
er they become stronger. Use the higher levels 
and hit points listed for each only when the 
witches are together in one place and when 
they know where the Black Opal Eye is. If the 
sisters are separated, or if one of them dies, or 
if they do not know whetc the Black Opal Eye 
is, do not use their higher spells and hit 
points. 

The Black Opal Eye also enables the witches 
to communicate teiepathically with their pan 
thers. It also gives them enormous additional 
power when the stars are in proper conjunc 
tion. It was during a conjunction that the 
witches attacked Elyas. A similar conjunction 
helped them give the Rahib power over the 
Siswa. 

The three sisters despise one another and 
often argue among themselves. When the 
three are together and not under attack, there 
is a 20% cummulativc chance per round that 
they will stop whatever they arc doing and 
bicker among themselves. If attacked, how 
ever, they always co-operate to defend them 
selves.
