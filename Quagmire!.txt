About this adventure 

Quagmire is a 
tombined wiider- 
ness and dungeon 
advcmure dcsign- 
cd 10 provide play- 
trs with a wide 
variety of new set- 
tings in whicli rheir 
charactcrs may ex- 
piore. Throughoui 
out the course of ihe adventurc, characters 
travel across strange seas, swampy pcninsu- 
las, and buming deserts. Each terrain holds 
new challenges for the characters, some that 
pcnain to the charactcrs" goais, and some 
that simply provide excitcmeiu. The adven- 
ture also allows for charactcrs to explore ihree 
scparate cities. 

Thc adventure is also dcsigncd to provide 
you, the Dungeon Mastcr, with a wide range 
of encounters set in various typcs of terraim 
How h you run these encounters directly affects 
how' wcll ihe characters pcrform their duties, 
and how exdlcd the playcrs gct while taking 
part in the game. When characters are 
exploring swamps, give the encounters in 
thost areas an cspedaJIy menacing and mys- 
tcrious feel. As characters movc through the 
descrt or across the sea, dcscribe their 
encounters as sunny and monoLonous. When 
characters explore mudfluis and cstuarics, 
dcscribe these areas as sticky, dangerous, and 
fillcd with thousands of strangc life forms. 

There are six main areas of advemuring in 
Quagmire; the comincm, Serpeni Penin- 
sula, the area surrounding the dty of Quag- 
mire, Thancgia Islanrf, the spiral cities 
(Quagmire. Thanopolis, and thc Sunkcn 
City), and thc scas. 

The areas introduced in Quagmire arc 
designed to expand thc DikD m world oudincd 
in thc Expen rulebook and oihcr Expert 
adventures. 

You may also place the areas and events of 
Quagmire within an already existing cam- 
paign sctting, as long as you makc sure ihe 
geographical areas of ymir campaign match 
those set forth in this advcnture. 

Before beginning play, you should read the 
entire adventurc carcfully and hecome com- 
pletely familiar with k. Most ofthe informa- 
ticm given in thc arca dcscriptions is Tor your 
eyes only, ahhough you should read all boxed 
text to the players as their characters enter 
spccifk areas. Feel free to usc your imagina- 
tion to embellish ihe encoumers as you wish. 
Make sure you donh give the players too 
many clues or suggestions, howevcr. 


Plot synopsis 

The adventure begins when the rharacters 
reccive an urgent plea from the leader of a 
city called Quagmire, The dty* once a tliriv- 
ing trading port, is now sinking into thc sea T 
and the city's leader is calling for hclp, 

K the charactcrs decide to hclp thc pcople 
of Quagmire, they may set out from any of 
theselocations: Slagovich, Specularum, Pra- 
mayama, Icrendi, or the IsJe of Dread. 

When the characters reach Quagmire, 
they find that it is under siege by crcatures 
from the surrounding swamp. Once the char- 
acters enter thc city, snrvivors there ask the 
characters to cscort them to the legcndary 
city of Thanopolis. According to the surv i- 
vors, Thanopolis lies on tlie southwest side of 
the island of Thanegia, 

Thanopolis does indccd exist, but it is 
infesicd with denizens of the surrounding 
swamps and jungles, Within thc legendary' city, 
which is a duplicate of Quagraire, ajie dues to a 
third sister city. rhis third dty sank centuries 
ago, and ls now inhabited by mcrmen. Thc 
characters may also try to find this city.

PREPAKING FOR THE EXPEDITION 



Use ihe Thartegia Wildemess Encounter 
Tables as ymi wmild the encounter tables in 
ihe Expcrt rtilebook, The Thanegia tabies 
have bcen set up to represent the different, 
more exotic types of ansmaJs that characters 
fmd in rcmote southem terrains, 

Capturing wild animals 

During the advcniure, characters may wam 
to capture wild hcrd animals (horses, mules, 
anri camds. for example). To capture a wild 
animaJ. a character must rope the animai. 

Wherher a character is on foot or on the 
back of another animal, his ehaoce of roping 
a wild animal is Lhe samc as if he were trying 
to hit ir with thrown oil or holy waten Con- 
sidrr an animal roped oncc a lasso hits it, 

For each character w f ho ropes an animaJ, 
roll 3d6, IT ihc dice rol! total is greater than 
the characier J s Strength score* rhe artimal 
escapcs. Otherwise, ihe animal i& considered 
to bc ropcd. 

Each rope on an animaJ diminafes onc of 
thc animal's attacJcs. If an animal has two 
auaeks, charatters must rope that animaJ 
twice bcforc it can be eonsidered captured. 

Adventure setting: 

The wild Iands 

(DM Map 1) 

Pages 16-17 of this adventure feature a Iarge- 
scalc wiidemessmap. Use this mapasa guide 
when charaeters travel by Jand or sea to 
Quagmire and heyond. 

This map may also serv r e as an cxample of a 
large-seale wildemess design. \bu may want 
to base dungeon and wilderness adventures 
on this map t or you may expand thc rnap by 
designing wildemess arcas where thc map 
Jeaves off. 

Following is a key to the areas memioned 


on the map, The key gives only a brief back' 
ground of mosr areas. Yo\i may "flesh out" 
indrviduaJ eneoumer areas wiih your own 
information. 

Tb rcad the wild lands map, start at the rop 
and read from left to right. The key below- is 
divided into seven parts: south eentral eonti- 
nent; Serpent Pcninsula; Scaof Dread; ShaJ- 
low Sea; Thanegia Island; Western 
Thanegioth Archipelago; and thc Westcm 
Sca. 

Wild lands map key 

South central continent: This area of land 
tndudcs the city of Slagovich, Bush Country, 
the Smd Desert, the Burning Waste, and the 
Barrcn Plain. 

G'jfy ofSingovkh; l'his opulent, Wcstem 
Sea trading port stands at the westcrn cnd of 
the Sind Desen Caravan Track. Characters 
may find all kinds of exotic goods being 
exchanged in rhe srreets of this hiliy city, Sla- 
govich's rockv port features cxcclleni, decp 
harbor facilities. 

Bush Cotmtry: This remotc grasdand 
Stretches southeast from Slagovich to the 
Neck Grasslands. It is bordered on the easl 
by the Sind Desert and on the west by a sandy 
shorelme that runs along the Westem Sea. 
Various rypes of wildlife are abundant here; 
so are nomadic hunterii. 

Sind Dcsert: This desen is more barren 
and stony than sandy, Rocky areas, craggy 
bJutTs, and patches of dry thorn bushcs dot 
the landscape. During the daytime, tcmpcra- 
tures often reach S00 degrees or highen At 
night, ihe temperatures drop to as bw as 30 
or 40 degrees. 

Experienced travelcrs do not travd during 
tbe noon or aftemoon on the Sind Desen. 
Most traveling is done during thc morning, 
late aftemoon, and early night. If charactcrs 
insist on travcling thmugh the desert during 
the hottest part of the day, have each of them 
make a saving throw va, death ray, Those 


w r ho fail their saving throws tafee I d4 points of 
damage from the intense heat. 

Burning Hhsre; This region of craggy, 
erodcd rocks Itcs over an active geothermal 
subsurface. Minor quakes and avalanchcs 
rock rhis arca frequemly, and geysers and tar 
pits are coitmion. The shiJhng rocks of Lhc 
wasle occasionaJJy releasc natural gascs, 
which then burst imo flnmt. T'hese gases 
burn for weeks, scndtng dark dtmds of smoke 
into the desert sky. Bccause of the area's vio- 
leriG unpredictable tcrrain, there are no per- 
manent dwdlings ur communitics in the 
Btiming Waste, Piteh, which is used for seab 
ing ships, is the area's onJy valuable com- 
modity. 

Barren Plain: This sandy, roJling sirctch 
ofland ts warmand windy. Little plani oranb 
mal lifc survivcs here, lt is bordeved on Lhe 
north by the Sind Desen nnd thc Burning 
W'aste. A rocky shordine that nins along the 
Sea of Dread fonns the plain's southern bor- 
dcr, The Silt River, which Jlows from fhc 
Burning Wasie to the Sea of Dread . cuts ihc 
plain in half. The Barren Plain is known for 
its iiidemem weathcr. 

Serpent Peninsula: How f this strelch of land 
eamed its name is not knnwn fnr sure, Some 
have speculated Lhal it w as so named because 
of the serpentinc trade route ihat ships must 
follow along its coast. Olhers fed the name is 
a referencc to the large numbernf snakes that 
livc throughouL the area, A caravan route 
known as "The Necldace' 1 separates Scrpent 
Pentnsula from the south central contincnt. 
The Necklace connects rhe easr coasr vtllagc 
of Sca Camel to thc west coast village of Mtilc 
Bcach. The geographical featttres of Serpent 
Pcninsula indude: the Neck Grasslands; the 
River HilJs; the Rain Forest; ihe Lagoon 
Lowlands, the Fangs; and ihe Serpent Keys. 

Nedc Gramthinds: So named because of 
Lhe narrnw isthmus they covcr, the Neek 
Grasslands are teeming wilh several kinds of 
dangerous creatures. The TTiroat River slices 
thraugh ihe center ofthe grasslands and cmp- 
ties into the Westcrn Sea at Mule Beach, Bmh 
oF ihL area's coasthncs are sandy 

Rivcr Hills: Grass and trees cover these 
rolling hills. Matiy of the peninsula's mean- 
deritig rivers start here and run down into 
other types of terrain in the form of waterfaJls. 

Rain Forest: Daily thundersiorms drench 
this forest and form rivers that wind to the 
surrounding seas. The Sea of Dread bordcrs 
the forest on the east; the Western Sea bor- 
dcrs on the wesL Wildlife abounds in this 
tropical region. Both of thc forest f s coasts are 
muddy.

PREPARING FOR THE EXPEDITION 


Lagoon Lowlands: Three large, fresh- 
water lakes lie: in th h sticky rcgion. Thc iand 
of this marshy bog: gives with each footstep. 
The earth here is so low and swampy thai it is 
difficult to tell where the muddy coastlines 
end and thc swampy lands begin. Seawater 
mingles with the roots of gnarled trees aJong 
thc coasts. 

The Fangs: These muddy poims of land 
are the southeast and somhwest tips of Ser- 
pent Peninsula. Traders use the Fangs as 
landmarks. East Fang Cape is due north of 
the city of Quagmire. A sea trade route that 
runs between the two capes separates the 
Lagoon Lowlands artd the Serpent Keys. 

Serpent Keys: These low, swampy islets 
lie just off the coast of the Lagoon Lowlands. 
Thc keys serve as natural breakwaters to pro- 
tect trade ships from the direct force of ihe 
Sea ofDread. Some of the smaller keys are no 
more than offshore sandbars. Most of these 
kcys have muddy coastlines. 

Sea of Drcad: This body of water i$ bor- 
dered by the continent to the northj Serpent 
Peninsula to the west, and thc Thanegioth 
Archipelago to the south. Many rivers empty 
from the continent and peninsula into the Sea 
of Dread. Sea Camel Gulf is a northwest 
extension of this sea. 

Narrow channels from this sca run past the 
city of Quagmirc into thc Shallow Sea. 

Shallow Sea: This body of water is bordered 
by Serpent Peninsula to the north and 
Thanegia Island lo the south. Channds that 
run past the dty of Quagmire connect this sea 
to the Sea of Dread. More channels run past a 
handful of isiands at this sea's westem end, 
connecting it to the Westem Sea. 

Thanegia ffiland: The history of this island 
is shrouded in mysteiy Legends speak of the 
Yavdlom* an early race of man that Jivcd hcre 
in harmony with the island's natural beauty. 
At that time* several different forms of life 
were said tt> have fihed the isLand. Thc leg* 
ends also say, however t that some unknown 
force eventually decimated the island's life 
forms, and the YavdJom apparemly moved 
on to other land$. The unknown forcc was 
actually the sJow sinking of the land that now 
makes up the floor of the Shallow Sea. 

New forms nf rare and exotic plant and 
animal life now thrive on this mystcrious 
island. The tropical island has four distinct 
regions: the Sinking Keys; the Thanegian 
Swamp; the Thanegian Jungle; and the Hiil 
Country. 

Siniing Keys: These keys are Jittle more 
than sandbars covered by sw'ampy vegeta- 


tion. They stretch all alongThanegia JsJand's 
northcrn coast, forming a natural break- 
water. The coasts of these keys tend to be 
muddy and swampy, 

Thanegian Swamp: This swamp is similar 
to the Lagoon Lowlands on Scrpent Penin* 
sula, There are, however, no fresh-water 
Jakes in thb swamp. This swamp tbrms the 
coastlinc for the emire island t and is only bro- 
ken by a fcw slow rivers. 

Thanegian Jungle: This jungle is similar 
to the Rain Forest on Serpent Peninsula, 
There is a greater variety of plant and animai 
life in this jungle, however. 



rolling highlands. All of the island's rivers 
flow from these hills. This regioti is so far 
inland that no one has ever seen it from 
aboard a ship. Similarly, characters could 
stand on the highest htH of this region and stilJ 
not be able to see the water that surrounds the 
island. 


Western Thanegioth Archipdago: This 
archipelago stretches northeastward from 
Thanegia Jsland's ea$tem coast. These Jow p 
swampy isles support more exotic forms of 
life than their sister islands to the east. Even 
Lhough most of these isJes are swampy, ihcir 
coastlines are sandy. 

Western Sea: This body of water is bordered 
by the Gulf of Huie ro the north and by Ser- 
pent PenmsuJa to the west- Chamiels run- 
ning through scattered islands connect ihis 
sea to the ShaJlow Sea* 

WeatheT and climate 

The general weather pattems of this parl of 
the world move from east to west. Tbe 
world's equator lies just south of Thanegia 


Island. The dimate of thi$ area is similar to 
that of Rorida or Cuba. 

Hurric&nes: If you begin this adventure at 
the suggested time (around the beginning of 
summer), this pan of the world is in thc mid- 
dJe of the hurricane season. Thcte i$ a chance 
that, when characters encounter gales at sea f 
they frnd themsdves in a hurricane. You may 
use the Optionaj Water Movemcnt Modifica- 
tion Chart (p. 44, D&D(r) ELxpert rulcbook) to 
determine if the charaeiers encounter gaJes. 

The percentage chance that a gale tums 
into a hurrtcane is given on Table J bdow, 
Findl the percentage chance given for the 
month or season and roll percentile dice, If 
the dice roil is lower than or equal to the indi- 
cated percentage chancc for thal month or 
season T the gale becomes a hurricane.

The effects of a hurricane are the $ame as 
the efTects of a gale, except that extremely 
heavy rains accompanv hujricanes. These 
rains are likely to flood ships. Even if a ship 
survives the cfTects of the high winds, there i$ 
a chance that it sinks from being filled with 
rainwater, 

A gaJley has a 40% chance of flooding and 
sinking. A sailing ship has a 20% chancc of 
flooding and sinking, Characters may

cargo overboard. !f characters thraw all of 
their cargo overboard in such a situation^ the 
chances of sinking are reduced to 20% for 
galleys, and 10% for sailing ships. 

If thc characters find theimdves knee deep

PREPARING FOR THE EXPEDITION 


Adventure background 

Finding the plea for help 

If your characters are at a sea coast, you may 
have them find thi$ plea for help. If thcy are 
not, have another party of adventurers find 
Lhe plca, and have rhis party carry word of 
thc plea to your characters, 

Characters discover the plea wrincn on a 
piece of parchmem that has been rolled up 
and sealed inside a glass bottle. 


If characters check around in Lhe local tav- 
ems and inns, they hear that Qriagmire is a 
rich trading capital. The characters also hear 
mmors that lizard men have been harassing 
the trading ships in the area around East 
Fang Cape, near rhe southern tip of Serpent. 
Peninsula, 

If characters investigate further, they fmd 
thai no one can recall thc last dme a ship 
arrived from Quagrnire. Some think the city 
is doomed. Qthers think il has already fallen. 

Preparing for the journey 

ff possible, this adventure should begin close 
to the first day of summer, You may alter this P 
however, depending on your time table and 
your campaign. 

The characters may begin their joumey in

When thc charactcrs find this parchment, cut 
the third partei from thc cover of this adventure, 
and give it to the players. This panel features a 
copy of the parchmcnt and a map of ihe wild 
lands. The playcrs may use this map fo chart 
the wild lands as tlieir characters exploiie them. 
You may nead thc following boxed text to ihc 
players, or you may lct them read if themsdvcs

may havc thc characters start from some 
other ItJcatiQn more fitting to your campaign. 
if you dccide to fit Quagmire and its sur- 
rounding arcas into your campaign setting. 

The characters may travel to Quagmirc by 
sea, by land, or m a combination of the two, 

If the charaeters decide to travd by sea t 
they must acquire a ship. Most character par- 
ties should have no trouble raising enough 
money to buy a small sail i n g sh ip. I f ihe char- 
actcrs cannot afford a ship, you may arrange 
matters so that thc characters are able to get a 
boat or smaJl ship that can sail the seas.

remember Lhat there is a chance ii may 
become a hurricane. See the ruleson Weaiher 
antl Climatc in this section fordetaih. 

While the charactcrs aie at sea, you should 
check for a wandering monster cncounter at 
leasi once per day. See the rules on Wander- 
ing Monslers in ihis sectinn Ibr dctails. 

If the charactcrs saij nut ofsight ofland and 
have no navigator aboard, chcefe to sci- if the

Scrub brush dots this gently-rolling grass- 
land. A small herd of grazing animals 
mdves slowly along the horizon. Thitk, 
gray hidescover these creatures, which, at 
rhe shoulder, stand as high as a dwarf As 
the beasis amblc doser, they appear to be 
much larger and heavier than they seemed

2. MOBILE MIIIAGE 


A shori hill rises just ahcad. From the top 
of the hill, the land stretches outward in 
desulation. A green shimmer rises slowly 
on the horizon. A small clump of palrn 
trees sways in ihe waves of heat that dauce 
on rhe sands. 


The oasis is juxSt a mirage. The distance to 
this mtrage is about 24 miles, If characters 
walk toward the msrage, it still reniains 24 
miles away, The mirage moves, tracing a cir- 
cular pattem of 6 hexes around a central hex, 
The mirage cominues to move for as long as 
the characters follow it. If the characters 
jgnore the mirage or do not travel toward it T 
it dtsappears, 

3. THW CEUST 

1 his encounter should occur only ontc, whcn 
the characters pass through the Burning 
Waste, 


Geysers spoui and rnudpots bubble amid 
broken boulders and balanced rocks here. 
The smcll of sulfur permeaLes the entire 
area, The ground sizzles continuously, 
sending waves ol hcat upward, 

A white patch of level ground lies just 
beyond spires of brokcn rock. No geother- 
mal activity marks this patch } which is 
bare and lifelcss. 


The white patch of ground is actuaJly a min- 
eral crust over boiling underground watcr. 
The charactcrs may circle around the patch 
by going through the surrounding rocks and 
mudpots, bul tt takes Lhcnt an hour to do so. 

If the chai acters send an animal or ihrow a 
weight of sotne son: onto ihe patch, the 
ground cracks slightly, No cracks appcar if 
the anlmal or item weighs less than 1 >000 t=n. 
If the characters try to walk across the patch, 
the first diaracter weighing Over 1 } 000 cn 


falls through the crust and into the hot water 
bdow' aftcr walking 100 fcet. 

The hot water causes Id6 points ofdamage 
per round of contact. Gharacters or animaJs 
ihat fall through thecrmt cannot climbout of 
ihe w'ater unassisted, because each attempt 
they tnake only breaks tnore of the cmst, 
Characters coutd nse magic fo rescuc a char- 
acter or animal frapped in the water. Other- 
wise. the characters should ireat the crust as 
thin ice whcn rescuing a trapped character or 
animal. 

4. INCLEMENT WEATHER 

Tdl the characters Lhat huge 5 dark douds arc 
massing on a distant horizon. The clouds 
approach rapidly, driven bv a howling wind. 
The storm hits 2 hours after thc characters 
flrirt spot it T Just beforc thc storm hils t ihc 
wind dies for a moment. Even tnseets stop 
chirping.

5. HEAT FLAGUE 


Humid breezes blow across the land as the 
sun beats down relentlessly. The air is 
thick with moisture; lts stifliog heai and 
heaviness tnakc cvcry attion a majnr 
cffort-even breathmg. 


If thc eharattcrs drink salty water or eat extra 
salt in their meaia, they teplace the salt thpy 
losc through perspiration whtlc in thts area. If 
rhccharacters take in no salt, each must make 
a saving throw vs. dragon breath. Characters 
w r ho fail thcir saving throws contraet heai 
piague. Any animals that accornpany thir 
charactcrs arc alsu affected by the hcat 
plague. 

The aytnptoms of heat plague includc

employer sent Lhem by ship to Serpent Fenin- 
sula to find another short route across the 
grasslands so a new trade route could be set 
up. The Kingdom of Ierendi, they say, no 
longer wants to use the expensive Necklace 
route across the isthmus. 

If the characters are specifically searching 
for this expedition (see set location encounter 
G), remind the piayers that their characters 
agreed to either escotl the expedition back to 
its parent ship t or to send word of the expedi- 
tion's status to the ship T s captain. 

7. DRENCHING RAINS 


Huge thunderheads tower over the hori- 
zon and move rapidly closer. Lighming 
flashes and thunder echoes against the 
hills as the storm approaches. 


A severc tropicaJ downpour movcs in ld4 
hours after the characrers first spoi thc thun- 
dcrheads. The storm lasts for ld4 hours. 
During this tlme T cut each characteris move- 
ment ratc and rangc or vision in haJf The

8, SWAMP SICKNESS 

After thecharacters have been in this area for 
a while, tell them that rhey begin to Fecl sick 
to their stomachs, They also develop mild 
headaches, 

The heat and moisture of the tropics pro- 
duce a hreeding ground for diseases. Every 
time characters move through a sw&mp or 
jungie, there is a chance that thcy comraet a 
disease. Jdave each character make a saving 
throw vs. death ray Characters whose saving 
ihrows faiJ takc ld4 points of damage from 
the sickness, 

9. SCAVENGER PARTY 


Twcnty lizard men, armed vvith spears, 
shamblc forward. Each carries a net and a 


sack. They appear to be preoccupied, and 
do not investigate the area around thcm. 
They only Jook forwand.

The lizard meu are headed toward the city of 
Quagmire. They do not see ihe characters. 

The characters may try to outrun the lizard 
men, hoping to head them oJT before chey 
reach the city, 

If the characters make too much noise as 
they stalk the lizard men (even if they speak 
in a whisper), the tizard men hear them and 
stop, Thcy brcak into two groups of 10 lizard 
men cach and cirde around, hoping to trap 
the characters between thc two groups. 

If the lizard men capture a character, or if 
thcy forcc him to smrender, they net thc char- 
actcr t search him for food and treasure, and 
thcn carry him toward theircamp. The lizard 
men f s camp is Jocated ort East Fang Cape. 
Thc captured character is set asidc to **take

10, THAT SINKING FEELING 


Leaf debris and spotiy growths of Jive veg^ 
etation mark the surface of the ground 
hcre. In some pJaces t a thm Jayer of watcr 
covers the soggy ground. Roots and vines 
seem to stretch ootward, sJithcring across 
thc land and through the smalt puddleB. 
The ground grows softer with each stcp. 


If characters take the time to probe the 
ground ahead t they are able to find firm foot- 
ing around thtr sofl grountJ. 

If a character steps forward into the sofl 
ground without taking any prccautions, thc 
carth begins to slowly swallow him. A charac- 
tercannot cscapc such a trap without the use 
of magic or without the help of other charac- 
ters. A trapped character does not know how 
deep the subsurface ts until he reaches bot- 
tom. 

RoJi percentiJe dice and refer to Table 5 to 
determme what kind of subsurface the char- 
actershave come upon. RoH the dice again to

If the characters ask Lenuwoi about his 
missioFK he telis them abom the sinking city 
ofQuagmire and its search for rescucrs. If the

to Quagmire for just that purposc, he smiles 
weakly and reaches out to shake the ncarcst 
characier's hand, 

"Ah t such good souis you arc. Then thcre

There are iwo islands on DM Map I that are 
marked with an "F." If thc charactcrs are

Western Thanegioth Archipelago, Lenuwol 
leads them to a paich oflarge stones. He tells 
the characters thai the pirates 3 supply cachc is 
buried beneath these stones (sce the first 
Gravesite Contents entry on Tablc 10 for thc

G. SURVEY SHIP 

A large sailing ship manned by a crew of 20 is 
anchored here, just off the coast of the Neck 
Grasslands. The $hip and crew appear to the 
characters to be friendly. The crew-members 
wave as the characterV ship approaches, but 
they do not signal for the characters' ship to 
stop, 

If the characters hail the ship peacefully T 
the ship's crew allows the characters to boartl. 
The ship is a private vessel sent by a wealthy 
merchant from the Kingdom of lerendi, Tbe 
crcw is waiting fbr a 12-member ejcpedition 
io return from the Serpem Peninsula. The 
crew-members tell the characters that the 
expedition has been gone for a week. They $et 
out to look for a new T short trade route across 
the peninsula, If the expedition can find such 
a route T the crew-members explain, the 
lerendi merchants won't have to use thc 
expcnsive Neckliice trade rOute between Sea 
Gajnel and Mule Beach. 

The crew-members are begimting to worry 
that the expedition members are dead or lost, 
The crew still has 500 iron rations and plemy 
of fresh water* but they fear that the expedi- 
tion might have run out ofprovisionsby now. 

The ship*s captain offers the characters 50 
gp and a fourth ofhis ship's rations to search 
for his expedition party. He offers an exlra 
150 gp and anothcr fourth of his ship's rattons 
if the characters return witlt any survivors 
from the expedition.

K* MULE BEACH 

This dusty-brown trading villagc stands at 
the spot w'hcre thc Throat River empues into 
the Western Sca. Mtdc Beach makes up the 
west end of The Necklace, the ancient land 
trade route that separates Serpenr Peninsula 


from the continem, Because of this, Mule 
Beach is a wdl-known village. It is here that 
cargo from ships is loadcd onto the backs of 
paek animals, and vice versa, Ships arrive at 
or lcave the village wharf every other day. 

Horses, camds, and mules stand all 
around this village, waiting to be loaded or 
unloaded. Caravans leave every other day for 
Sea Camet, whichlies at the other end t>rThc 
Necklace. Characters can walk The Necklace 
in 6 days. Therc is no charge to join a caravan 
that travels Thc Necklace, but anyone w r ho 
joins must provide his own transportation, 
food, and water. Those who join such a cara- 
van must also help dcfend the caravan if it is 
attacked.

M. BRIGAND FERRY 

A ferry, which can hokl 50 passengerg or 12 
pack animals, operates at the point where 
The Necklace crosses the Throat River. Two 
ropes guidc the raft from one Janding to thc 
other. The passengers use the ropes to pull 
the ferry across. 

Bands of brigands, one on each river bank, 
charge fur the use of the ferry, Normally* usc 
of the ferry would be free. The brigands 
demand 1 gp per human or demi-human and 
2 gp per animaJ. If the characters don't pay* 
ihe brigands do not allow them to use the 
ferry. 

The Throat River is 500 feet wkk at this 
point, and it flows quite fast, The only ways 
characters can avoid the hrigands* highway 
robbery are to dcfcat the brigands and drive 
them off the banks, or try to ford the river 
theimelvcs. 

If a character iries to ford the river alone, 
he has a 50% chance of success. A charactcr 
riding an animal has a 75% chance of suc- 
cessfully crossing ihe river. An animal that 
has no rider has a 25% chance of successfully 
crossing the river. Increase these odds by 
10% if the animals and/or characters tie 
themsdves together beforc crossing. There is 
a risk to this approach, however. If any ani- 
mal tied to other animals fails to cross suc- 
cesaftlUy, all animala behind the fallen animal 
are lost ( unless the characters cui the fallen 
animal loose. 

If a character riding an animal fails to 
crosSj the animal throws the characLer. Con- 
sider any character who fails 10 cross aJone as 
a "thrown" character, also. 


The rivcr washes all thrown characters 
downstream. Have each thrown charactcr 
roll ld20 to sce if he is able to reach either riv- 
erbank without hdp. If the number rolled is 
lower than or cqual to that character's 
Strength score, the character reaches ihe 
shore of his choice. If the number rollcd is 
higher than that characieris Strength score, 
the character cannot reach eilher shore. He 
must remove any hcavy armor that he has on p 
or he drowns. He may make another die roll 
in the next round. 

Thc brigands who live downstream daitn 
any pack animals or supplies lost by the char- 
acters in the river 

If the characters try to defeat one of thc 
brigand bands, the brigands on the other 
bank are wamed to be prepared for the char- 
acters when thcy cross, If the characters drive 
the brigands off, all of the survdvors regroup 
and attack thc characters further along Thc 
Necklacc.
