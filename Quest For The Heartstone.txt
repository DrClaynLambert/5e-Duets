tion to embellish the encounters as you wish. 
Make sure you don't give the players too 
many dues or suggestions, however,

specific areas in the adventure. When the text 
di rects you to show the players a specific illus 
tration p turn to that page and Jet the players

The party of adventurers 

This adventure is designed for a party of 6-8 
characters. Each character should be 
between the 5th and 10th levels of experience 
when the adventure begins. The party should 
have a total of 45-55 levels, and should also 
include at least two clerics. You may wish to 
adjusL the strength of certain monsters and 
encounters, based on the makeup of the 
party. 

The party may be able to finish this adven 
ture in one session. If you feel the party is 
moving too quickly through the adventure, 
you may wish to make things a little more 


"difficult" for them. Be careful to give the 
characters a reasonable chance of surviving, 
however. Try to be impartial and fair, but 
give the characters the benefit of the doubt in 
extremely dangerous situations. 

Adventure background 

The story of the heartstone 

Sadness now reigns in the Kingdom of Ghyr 
Old King Gamo. known as the Great 
Defender of Peace, died in his sleep 2 weeks 
ago at the age of 82. Best known for his victo 
ries in die Prism Wars* Ganto ascended to the 
throne of Ghyr nearly 37 years ago, As the 
countries surrounding Ghyr fought among 
Lhemsdves, Ganto kept his northern king 
dom out of war. 

Having no legal heirs, Ganto thought 
much about who would be the logical succes 
sor to his throne. Unfortunately, he did not 
share his thoughts with his young queen. 
Queen Leahra, now in her mid*thirties, had 
always been a faithful and loving wife; she 
had often refused the affections of the ambi 
tious nobles of Ghyr. 

Now that the king was dead, Leahra found 
herself in the awkward position of having to 
appoint (and marry ) a new king. She called 
together the Royal Council to seek its advice. 
Some of the council members aspired to the 
throne themselves. Others had their own 
favorite candidates. The final decision, how r - 
ever, fell to the queen, who had m> desire to 
rule the kingdom alone. 






Queen Leahra, acting on her own, also 
called on her dose confidant* Loftos, the 
High Patriarch of Ghyr Leahra asked the 
patriarch to come to her chambers one night 
and discuss the question of the new king, 

"Political intrigue runs high tonight, my 
queen. 1 fear that the kingdom will be tom 
apart by political strife in the months ahead " 
advised Loftos. "Dark plots are being 
hatched at this moment-not only among the 
nobles, but also among Ghyr's neighbors " 

"But how can I choose? Must I share my 
life and more with a stranger? Loftos, my 
heart belongs only to Ganto" the queen 
replied. 

The old cleric offered to commune with He 
Who Watches in hopes of finding a solution to 
the crisis. Loftos snuffed all but one of the 
candles in the queen's chamber. He carried 
the single burning candle to the open win 
dow, placed it gently on the sill, and knelt 
before it. After Loftos blew out the flame, the 
queen could barely see him bow his head in 
prayer. 

Minutes later, Loftos relit the candle and 
carried it toward the queen. "A heart of 
stone, beyond the mist you'll find" Lottos 
said softly. "The hcartstone will tell you who 
should be your king." 

"But where is this stone? How will I find 
it?" the queen asked, 

"The stone was stolen over 50 years ago by 
Dahnakriss the Master Thief. He Who 
Watches originally gave the tiny, heart- 
shaped stone to Qasmar, who was the King of 
Ghyr during the Prism Wars. During these 
wars* Qasmar used the stone to see into the 
hearts of men, and was so able to choose his 
friends and allies. Soon after the war, the 
magical stone vanished from Gastle Ghyr's 
supposedly thief-proof vaults. Until now, no 
one knew what had become of the heartstone. 
According to He Who Watches, it lies north, 
In the great Mountains of Ice. 

"We must convince a party of adventurers 
to retrieve the stone and bring it back to us, 
But we must be very careful. No one must 
know of the stone's power* especially not 
those who would aspire to the throne. Even 
those we hire to find the stone should not 
know of its strength!" 

Beginning the adventure 

The patriarch calls the player characters to 
Castle Ghyr. He tells the characters only that 
they have been called in the queen's name, 
and that they will be discussing important 
royal business, 

Begin the adventure by reading the boxed 
text to the players. 



The Great Hall of Castle Ghyr rises 
majestically before you. Two acolytes hold 
open the heavy double doors in the north 
wall. The High Patriarch of Ghyr sweeps 
through the doors, followed by six royal 
guards. The queen berselT follows closely 
behind. The queen bids you to sit as the 
patriarch steps forward to speak. 

"Thank you for coming/ 1 he says. "We 
have a very important quest for those of 
you who are ^willing, You would set out to 
the north, heading into the Mists. In case 
you're not familiar with it, this vast, foggy 
marsh lies at the foot of the Mountains of 
Ice* You are to search for a magical, heart- 
shaped stone that we believe gives off a 
bright red light. We also believe that 
Dahnakriss the Master Thief currently 
possesses this stone. Through commune, I 
was able to determine dial the hcartstone 
lies within the mountain beyond the 
Mists. 

"If you succeed in this quest* ihe queen 
has authorized me to reward each of you 
wiih 10,000 gold pieces. As additional 
incentive* you are certainly welcome to 
any other treasures you might find during 
the quest," 


If the characters ask about the stone's power 
and value, the queen replies* "It once 
belonged to King Qasmar. We want to bury it 
in Gamo's tomb." 

The patriarch then continues* "The 
stone's powers are mostly unknown. We 
believe it may affect anyone who touches it, 
SO we are providing you with a pair of tongs 
with which to pick up the stone* and a lead 
coffer in which to carry it" 


The patriarch rises and tells those who 
wish to participate in the quest that they 
should assemble in the Great Hall at dawn 
the next day. 

At dawn the next day, the characters assem 
ble in the Great Hall. Royal servants provide 
fresh fruit and juices for the adventurers. 
Soon the patriarch enters and thanks the 
characters for agreeing to go on the queen's 
quest. Hr tells the characters that fresh horses 
and rations await them at the east gate. 
Before he sends them off, the patriarch gives 
the characters one last item. He slowly 
removes a gold ring from the index finger of 
his right hand. 

"This is a ring of spell storing I have had it 
for nearly half my life. If you return, I would 
like to have it hack 

"The ring contains two each of the follow 
ing spells: neutraJixe poison, raise dead* and 
stone to flesh." 

The cleric asks that he may pray for the 
characters' success. He bows his head, recites 
a litany of unrecognizable words, and then 
looks up at one of l he party's clerics. He 
hands the ring to this cleric and says* "Guard 
it well, ll may save your friends' lives." 

if the characters ask why the pat riarch did 
not use one of the raise dead spells on King 
Ganto, the patriarch replies that the king's 
natural time to die had come. 

An acolyte enters the room carrying a 
small pair of iron tongs and a small lead cof 
fer. He lays them on a table and leaves with 
out saying a word. 

"Good luck*" the patriarch tells the charac 
ters, "The queen's and my prayers go with 
you,"

ADVENTURE IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAIN 


Characters must travel through two areas on 
their way to the mountains. The first is a 
misty marsh that tests the characters' 
strength and courage in battle. The second is 
a cliff face peppered with holes that lead into 
the heart of the cliff (and eventually to the 
heart of the adventure). 

Mists of the northern 

marsh 

(Use Map 1.) 

Traveling through the marsh 

Because of the mist and rain in this area, and 
because the trail leading through here takes 
many winding turns, the characters' horses 
must move slowly through the marsh. At 
some points, the trail is only wide enough for 
one horse. Use your judgment about the 
I rail's width when characters get into a sticky 
situation. 

If the characters try to leave Lhe path, the 
lead horses begin to sink in quicksand. If the 
characters do not return to the path, they lose 
their lead horses in the quicksand (the riders 
are able to escape the quicksand, however). 

Wandering monsters in the marsh 

If the characters decide to spend the night 
somewhere in the marsh, roll for wandering 
monsters every 4 hours (see Table 1)

If the action bogs down, or if the party 
spends too much time searching for treasure, 
have the characters encounter six white drag- 
onllics. For a complete description of these 
monsters, turn to the New Monsters section 
at the end of the adventure. 

Combat in the marsh 

Because of the rain and mud in the marsh, 
characters suffer a -1 penalty on their hit rolls 
as long as they stay in the marsh. 

During any combat, roll for morale each 
round, and reduce the monsters' morale by 1 
each round. As soon as the monsters fail their 
morale check, they stop lighting the charac 
ters anti run back to their lair. 

There is a 50% chance that monsters in the 
marsh attack a mounted character's horse 
instead of the character. If a horse loses more 
than half of its hit points, it throws its rider 
and uses its hooves to defend itself.

Encounter key 
L RIDING INTO THE MARSH 


The journey through the eastern forest 
passed quietly. Now, the wind is still, and 
heavy- clouds have darkened the afternoon 
sky. The forest slowly gives way to a vast 
marshland. The trail from the lores* leads 
into a sea of tall grass and thick fog. 
Patches of mist hug the ground, and the 
Mountains of Ice stand in the distance, 
The cries of marsh birds and the croaking 
of frogs come from all directions. 

Slowly rain begins to fall. The tails of 
giant leeches and snakes occasionally 
slither across the trail and wind into the 
marsh. 

As the trail twists inward, the fog grows 
thicker, finally, a stone bridge rises above 
the mist, offering the first sign that more 
than animals Jive in this bleak swamp. 


Show the players Illustration 1. The stone 
bridge is one of four bridges that dot the 
marsh These bridges arc quite sturdy. 

Characters cannot use a boat in this marsh, 
because fresh water termites have infested the 
marsh. If any character enters the waters of 
the marsh, two termites instantly spray him, 
A sprayed character musi make a saving 
throw vs, poison or he paralyzed for 1 rum. It 
a character is paralysed, he falls into the 
water and drowns if others do not save him,

2* LAIR OF GHOULS 


The rotting carcass of a giant leech lies in 
a small clearing to the right of the trail, 
Two dark figures scramble off the top of 
the leech and disappear into the marsh 
grasses. 


'lwelve ghouls attack Lhe characters as soon as 
they move through this clearing.

These ghouls carry no treasure, but they do 
have treasure hidden in their lair. Characters 
have a 1 in 6 chance of finding the lair (elves 
have a 2 in 6 chance). Each searching charac 
ter may check only once. 

The ghouls' treasure includes 3*241 cp, 
seven pieces of jewelry worth a total of 750 
gp, a shield */, and a small lead box contain 
ing a heart-shaped stone. The stone gives ofT 
a yellow glow, and is magical. Touching the 
stone negates the effects of paralysis. It has 6 
charges left, 

3, MAZE OF TROGLODYTE LAIRS 


A second stone bridge lies ahead, rising 
above the mists that hug the marsh 
ground. A foul stench hangs in die air 
near this bridge. Beyond the bridge, the 
trail leads to a four-w*ay intersection. The 
skull of a goblin is set on a stake near the 
right path. The skull of a troll rests on a 
pile of rocks near the left path. Straight 
ahead, a dozen sharpened stakes stick out 
of the muddy trail. The trail ahead is 
wider than the trails to the left or right. 


The characters must remove some af the 
stakes from the path ahead of them if they 
want to go in that direction. The rain has 
made the stakes easy to remove. 

No matter which trail the characters take, 
they eventually come upon troglodyte lairs. 
These family lairs are scattered along the 
many branching paths. Each lair appears as a 
15-foot clearing. The soggy remains of a 
campfire lies in the center of each clearing. 
Various bones are strewn about.

Once the characters have fought two families 
of troglodytes, the other troglodytes in the 
area know that something is wrong. They 
gather up their belongings and hide in the 
marsh. They do not attack the characters 
anymore. 

The troglodytes carry no treasure, but they 
have buried some treasure in their lairs. The 
characters have a 1 in 6 chance of finding the 
treasure (elves - 2 in 6). Each character may 
search only once, 

The first troglodyte treasure the characters 
find contains 369 gp and one 500 gp gem. 
The second treasure contains 2,483 sp, a 500 
gp gem, four 100 gp gems, and a crude map 
of the maze. Show the players Illustration 2 if 
they find the second troglodyte treasure. The 
runes in this illustration spell the word

4, THE GIGANTIC MARSH 

CREATURE 


Just past a third bridge, the trail begins to 
arc slowly to the right, skirting the west 
ern half of a very large pond. The falling 
rain is all that disturbs the pond's surface. 
A screech suddenly splits the air as a 
three-headed, flying monster glides 
toward you over the surface of the pond. 
The creature has the heads of a lion, a 
goat, and a dragon. Seconds later, a 
gigantic, translucent crocodile head 
bursts from the depths of the pond. Then 
two giant basilisk head# on long, snakdike 
necks rise out of the marsh pond to the 
south. Behind them, a large orb covered 
with eyeballs on short tentacles pops up 20 
feet out of the water. 


Have the characters roll for surprise as soon 
as they see the crocodile head. Show the play 
ers Illustration 3. 

All of the monster heads are pan of an 
insane water elemental that can change its 
great shape to any form. It sits in this pond 
feeding on whatever comes near. Most of the 
elemental remains underwater, A chimera 
files overhead just as die elemental rises from 
the pond. 

On the bust round, the basilisk heads 
attack the party. The crocodi le head snaps the 


three-headed chimera out of midair and pulls 
it underwater. As soon as the elemental takes 
30 points of damage, it pulls its appendages 
back underwater and disappears.

Only magic and magical weapons can harm 
this monster. Charm monster and cloudkill 
do not affect it. 

5. HOBGOBLIN LAIR 


The trail leads northeast, as the land to the 
left of the trail rises slowly. The fog con 
ceals ihe land's true height. The smell of 
roast meat 11 oats across the trad from the 
northeast, and the sound of clamoring and 
gruff conversation rises through the reeds 
ahead, 


If the party scouts or rides ahead, they see the 
following: 


The trail leads into a large clearing thai 
sits next to a rock-strewn cliff. The trail 
cuts through the middle of the clearing 
and leads out on the other side. Six crude* 
three-sided huts stand around the clear 
ing. Smoke rises out of the huts* chim 
neys. 


Twenty-four hobgoblins live in this area. The 
hobgoblins sound the alarm and attack as 
soon as they sec the characters. They carry 
dubs and knives.

After 2 rounds of battle , some of the hobgob 
lins run away Ask the players if their charac 
ters continue to light, or if they stop to watch 
the fleeing hobgoblins. Any character who 
stops to watch cannot attack that round. If a 
hobgoblin is attacking that character, how 
ever, the creature gets a +4 on hit rolls against 
that character. Roll on Table 2 tor any charac

hobgoblin is gone. If the character success 
fully searches for a secret door, he finds the 
hobgoblin king's cave (area 5a). 

If the characters capture and question any 
hobgoblins, the creatures claim to know 
nothing, but they do say that the king might 
know. If characters promise a hobgoblin free 
dom. the creature tells the characters where 
they can find the king. 

Characters may find a hidden cache in the 
camp that contains 1,500 gp. four 100 gp 
gems, and four potions of heating. The hob 
goblins have dug an 8-fool by 15-fom hole 
near the eastern end of the camp. The trap is 
10 feet deep. Sharp spikes line the walls and 
fioor of the pit. These spikes kill any horse 
that falls into the pit There is a 2 in 6 chance 
that the spikes do 10 points of damage U> a 
character 

5a. Hobgoblin king's cave 


The rocky door swings inward. The sound 
of scurrying animals, mingled with the 
sound of growling and gnashing teeth ech 
oes off the walls. A sputtering torch dimly 
lights the small cave. A hobgoblin, 
dressed in chain mail and holding a dan 
gerous-looking sword, stands in a roiwr 
by a bed. The growling erupts into snarls 
as four large creatures leap forward 


The hobgoblin wearing the chain mail is the 
hobgoblin king. As soon as the characters 
enter his cave, he retreats to his private cave 
("'X" on Map I). Four thouls act as the 
king's bodyguards.

ADVENTURE IN THE SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAIN 


Ef the characters capture and question the 
king, he reluctantly tells them about an 
amazing human who wears a glowing red 
slonc around his neck. The king tells the 
characters that this strange man has visited 
him several times. The man has asked the 
hobgoblins to watch for and kill any strangers 
that travel through the marsh. In return, the 
man has given the king good food and many 
gifts. The king explains (hat the man is a 
friend of the giants that live in the face of the

The hobgoblin king keeps a chest hidden 
under his bed. The chest is trapped with a 
poison needle. Inside the chest are pieces of 
jewelry worth a total of 2,000 gp, a scroll of 
protection from elemental^, and <t potion of

6. THOUL LAIR 


A fourth bridge comes into view ahead as 
the trail winds lazily toward the southeast. 
A faint rumbling rolls far in the dislam e to 
the north. Eight large creatures burst sud 
denly from the cover of the marsh and 
attack savagely. 


The attacking creatures are thouls.

7. TROLL POND 


The trail winds slowly to lhe northeast. 
The marsh turns muddier as the rain con- 
tintaes to fall. Many small ponds lie to the 
sides of the trail. Up ahead, large bubbles 
rise to the surfaces of the ponds. Just as 
another bubble plops, three huge, filthy 
creatures burst from the grass by the trail. 


Roll for surprise when the trolls attack. 
Before attacking the characters, these vile 
creatures sink their claws into the three 
horses nearest them .

The troll lair contains the following treasure: 
3 t 244 gp, eight 100 gp gems, a swoiri +1, 
leather armor +1. and a small lead box. Inside 
the box is a small, heart-shaped stone that 
gives off a blue glow. Any character who 
touches lhe stone is fully healed. The stone 
has 3 charges left. 

If the characters manage to start a normal 
fire in this area, the marsh gases in the ponds 
explode, doing 6d6 points of damage to all 
creatures that fail to make saving throws vs. 
spells. Because of the rain, the characters 
have a difficult time starting a fire here. If 
any character casts a firebaJI spell, however, 
the exploding gases do 12d6 points of damage 
to all creatures that fail to make a saving 
throw vs. spells. 

If the characters do a great deal of damage 
to the trolls, they are able to leave Lhis area 
before the trolls regenerate. The trolls are 
fully healed (and even meaner), however, if 
the characters pass through this area on the 
journey back to Castle Ghyr. 

8, GRIFFONS OF THE NORTHERN 
SKIES 


The trail leads gradually uphill Lo the 
northeast- The winds carry faint rum 
blings from the west. Thick mists shroud 
the marsh. 

The trail eventually ends at a "T* 5 
intersection. One trail leads to the north 
west; the other leads to the southeast. The 
sound of flapping wings rises from the 
north and draws closer, Screeching 
winged creatures suddenly Till the sky 
above. The creatures circle once and then 
descend.

knocked off his horse. The griffons automati 
cally catch any riderless horses, carrying 
them off to the west . The griffons do defend 
themselves if the characters attack them. 
Once the griffons have all of the characters' 
horses, however, they leave the party alone. 

If the characters follow- Ehe eastern path, 
they find their way blocked by an avalanche. 


9 . ABANDONED CABIN 


The trail winds around to the northwest, 
skirting a cliff face to the north that rises 
higher and higher as the trail twists fur 
ther along. The sound of a waterfall thun 
ders in the distance. Just ahead, a small 
log cabin sits on the trail's right side. No 
light comes from Us windows, and no 
smoke rises from its chimney Cobwebs 
hang over the rotting porch. 

Just beyond the cabin, the trail leads 
downward into a massive patch of dense 
fog.

Exploring the cave openings 

If characters follow the trail that runs to the 
northwest past the cabin at area 9, they find 
themselves at the foot of a cliff face. An arrow 
on Map 2 that points to area 9 shows the rela 
tionship of Map 2 to Map 1. 

This dilT face is sheer. In most cases, char 
acters cannot leave the trail, which lias been 
cut into the side of the cliff. Characters can 
not ride horses on these rocky trails. Charac 
ters may climb vines to reach a cave opening, 
however, or they may use magic to reach an 
opening. 

The rocky trail is wet and slippery, but the 
air at the foot of this cliff is not cold enough to 
freeze the trails.

10. FOOT OF THE CLIFF 


Patches of fog float through the area. A 
waterfall thunders nearby. The trail has 
become very' wet and slippery. Soon, the 
trail gives way to wide ledge that hugs the 
Foot of a cliff. 

To the west, a great waterfall cascades 
down from hundreds of feet above. The 
spray from the falls is icy cold. Straight 
ahead, a huge cliff rises into the mists. 
Cave openings riddle the face of the cliff. 


Show the players Map 2. The characters 
must now choose which cave opening they 
want to explore first. To reach area 13, they 
must climb 50 feet up a pile of boulders to a 
ledge that leads to the cave mouth, lb reach 
other cave openings, characters can cither 
follow the trail, climb vines, or use magic. 

If the characters make a great deal of noise, 
or if they spend more than 5 minutes deciding 
what to do, six dire wolves emerge from area 
10a and attack the characters (see area 10a 
for dire wolf statistics). 

10a. Dire wolves' den (Map 2a)

11. LOWER CAVE 


Several muddy pathways lead out into the 
marsh from this opening. Some of the 
paths have been used recently. Claw- 
tracks lead into the cave. A fetid odor 
pulses out of the opening, almost as if the 
cave were breathing. 


If characters enter this cave opening, they see 
a tunnel that winds back Into darkness. This 
tunnel leads to Level I: The Tunnels of Death 
(areas 19-42).

This tunnel is dark and cold. The tunnel 
ascends slowly as it leads back. The walls 
are rough and cold. The passageway is 6 
feet wide. 


The tunnel runs for 100 feet, and then ends at 
a 20-fbot-high wall. When characters have 
moved 40 feet into the runnel, they notice the 
wall, but as they move closer (another 10 
feet), they see that a cave opens up above the 
wall. 

At this point, the characters hear the flap 
ping of wings. If they look at the top of the 
''wall " the characters see two pairs of human 
eyes staring down at them. Two manticores 
lie in the cave above the "waIL M As they peer 
over the edge, they ready their spiked tails for 
a dean shot at the characters. As soon as the 
characters have moved 60 feet into the passa 
geway, the manticores shoot their spikes at 
the characters. Each spike has a chance of hit 
ting one random character.

14. WHITE DRAGON'S LAIR (Map 2d) 


Ice covers the walls, floor, and ceiling of 
this frigid cave. The tunnels in the cave 
are 20 feet wide and 20 feet high. 

Forty feet into the cave, the floor gives 
way to a frozen pool that glows dimly. A 
great mound of ice lies beyond the far 
edge of the pool. The ice mound slowly 
begins to turn around. A large, white rep 
tilian head looms up from the mound, and 
says, '"Argon! We have uninvited 
guests! 11 

A gruff voice,, booming from around 
the comer, answers the first, "Are they 
coming for dinner or were they just leav 
ing?" 


The characters have entered the lair of a 
white dragon. The ice on the pool is strong 
enough to support the characters 1 weight. 

The dragon is the only creature in the lair 
when Lhe characters enter. The dragon uses 
ventriloquism to make the characters think 
He is not alone. 

If the characters leave immediately, the 
dragon does not pursue them. However, if 
the characters try to talk to the dragon, it 
becomes angry and gives the characters the 
option of leaving. If the characters attack the 
dragon, or if any character utters any magical 
words, the dragon breathes a cone of cold that 
does 40 points of damage to anyone within 
range (standing on the pool of ice). Chara* - 
ters who make successful saving throws vs. 
dragon breath suffer 20 points of damage. 
T he dragon uses its cone of cold even if the

dragon tries to Jly away over the characters 1 
heads. 

If the characters investigate further into 
the dragon's lair, read the following boxed 
text 10 the players. 


Around the comer to the southwest, a 30- 
foot-Icmg, dimly lit tunnel leads into a 
brightly Ht cavern. The air grows colder 
and colder as the tunnel leads closer to the 
light. The tunnel opens up into a frigid, 
oval-shaped cavern. Huge icides hang 
like stalactites from the ceiling. A frozen 
pond covers the cavern's floor. An eerie 
glow comes from beneath the ice of this 
pond, lighting up the cavern Beyond the 
pool, the tunnel appears to continue ro the 
south. 


If characters scrape the surface of the pond, 
they discover that treasure is frozen at the 
bottom of the 6-fom-deep pool. A continual 
light gem illuminates the pool. As soon as the 
characters try to cm through the ice, or if they 
try to walk across it, read the following boxed 
text to the players. 


The ice on the pond begins to crack. 
Stalagmites and stalactites crack, tall, and 
shatter on the pond's surface. Seconds 
later, the pond erupts* sending shards of 
ice flying in all directions. A flash of white 
surges up through the ice as cold water 
rushes out over the pond's surface. 

A blast of searing cold Alls the cavern, 
and a six-legged reptile slithers out of the 
pond onto the ice. It approaches slowly, 
then rears up on its hind legs to attack. 


As long as this frost salamander is alive, each 
character within 20 feet of the creature takes 
ld8 points of cold damage per round. If the 
salamander fails a morale check, it dives 
beneath the pond surface and lies still at the 
bottom, as if it were dead. If the characters 
then try to recover die treasure at the bottom 
of the pond, the salamander attacks again.

tion. Two rats run by and scurry toward 
the cave opening. 

An intersection lies 50 feet into Lhis run 
nel. Other tunnels run to the left and 
right. The left tunnel appears to curve 
around to the right, while the right tunnel 
appears to curve around to the left. 
Twenty feet straight ahead, five large rep 
tile skulls hang mysteriously in midair. 


Show the players Illustration 5. The skulls 
are hydra skulls. IF the characters step up to 
examine the skulls, they fall into a trap (go to 
area 20). 


Strong threads hanging from the roof of 
the cave suspend the hydra skulls in midair. 

If the characters examine the cave floor* they 
notice dial the tunnels to the left and right do 
not seem to get much use. Clawed footprints 
mark the floor to the south of the hanging 
skulls. If characters go around the skulls, 
moving along the south wall of the tunnel, 
they do not fall into the trap. 

20, SKULL TRAP 

Characters who inspect the hanging skulls 
here fall through a trapdoor in the floor. The 
characters do not get a chance to notice that 
the skulls hang by threads. 

The pit is 10 feel wide and 40 feet deep. 
Characters who fall into the trap suffer 4d6 
points of damage. 

HOOK HORROR 7 " Monster carcasses 
litter the pir floor just beneath the trapdoor. 

The trapdoor springs shut immediately 
after swallowing its victim(s). Characters 
who try to pry the door open must use a 
wedge to do so. 

The characters are now m a subterranean 
passageway. The tunnel ends to the west, lb 
the east, the tunnel appears to continue into 
darkness. If characters walk east, they dis 
cover that the passageway bends to the north 
east, and runs for 50 feet. The tunnel then 
turns to the east for 80 feet before twisting 
around to the north again. The passageway 
rises gradually as it leads toward the east. 
Characters may follow this passageway to 
area 29. 

21. MANTICORE FEEDER 

If the characters wander down this dark hall 
way, die front rank of the party (no more than 
two characters) suddenly disappears. A pres 
sure-activated teleporter set into the floor of 
the tunnel teleports its victims to the spot 
marked W T" in the mantitores lair (area 
13) See Map 2b for the spot marked H T." Be 
sure, to keep track of how many 10-second 
rounds pass before other characters use the 
teleporter. Doing so tdls you how many 
rounds the first characters spend fighting the 
mamicores before other characters arrive, 

Dahnakriss put this teleporter here to weed 
out the large number of Hook Horrors in the 
area, 

A secret door stands in the north wall of 
this Tunnel. The door is extremely hard to 
detect. Elves have a 1 in fi chance to find die 
door, while other character classes have a 1 in 
10 chance. 


22. CHIMERA FEEDER 

This area is similar lo area 21, except the 
teleporter sends its victims to the spot marked 
<Ji T >T in the chimera lair (area 16), See Map 
2d for the spot marked 'T 1 

23* TUNNEL BRANCH 


Ten feet beyond the hanging skulls, this 
tunnel branches off to the left. The walla 
here are slimy and cold, The tunnel also 
appears to continue straight ahead. 


If characters go to the left, they enter area 24. 
If they go straight* they enter area 25. 

24, PIT TRAP 


A wooden door stands at the end of this 
tunnel. Long claw marks mar the door's 
surface. The scratches start about 5 feet 
up the door and run all the way to the 
ground. 


A trapdoor lies in the floor at the of this tun 
nel. A distance of 2 feet lies between the 
wooden door and the trapdoor. If eharaciers 
walk along the west wall o! this tunnel, they 
do not fall through the trap. The wooden 
door is false . 

Characters who walk down the center of 
the tunnel fall through the pit if they come 
within 12 feet of the wooden door. They fall 
40 feet and take 4d6 points of damage. The 
trapdoor immediately springs back shut 

Characters who have fallen through the pit 
are in a damp, 15-foot-wide subterranean 
passageway. If characters walk toward the 
southwest in this passageway, they eventually 
come to the area beneath the trap at area 20. 
If they follow the passageway to the east , they 
eventually come to area 29. 

If characters examine the passageway 
floor, they notice clawed footprints. 

25. TUNNEL FORK 


The tunnel forks here. One tunnel runs 
northeast. The other rum southeast. No 
sound comes from the northeast, bui 
strange dicks echo down the hallway from 
the southeast. 


26* HOOK HORROR LAIRS 

Just before characters enter this area, read 
the following boxed text to the players.

ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


Oily, clawed footprints extend toward the 
north and south here, Oil drips into the 
tunnel from small cracks in the walls. 
Shallow pools of oil lie on the tunnel floor 
The sound of clicking grows slowly louder 


No matter which path of footprints the char 
acters follow , continue reading the boxed text 
in the players. 


The tunnel opens into a large, pear- 
shaped cavern. Huge, vulture!ike crea 
tures stand around the cave, growling and 
squawking. Each creature is 7 feet tall. 
Each has the head of a vulture and the 
hide of a black rhino. The creatures walk 
on clawed feet, and they have thick, single 
talons instead of hands. They turn sud 
denly, raising their talons to attack. 


Each of these areas contains six Hook Hor 
rors.

shaped cave. A large pool of oil fills the 
south end of the cave. A blood-curdling 
squawk splits the silence a s huge yellow 

daws swoop down from above. 

-- -=. --- 

Five extremely strong Hook Horrors jump 
down from ledges that run around this cave's 
walls. They attack as soon as the characters

The treasure consists of 444 sp, 211 ep. 325 
gp. a potion of healing, a potion of fire resist 
ance, and a silver-headed hammer worth 500 
gp. The hammer is useless as a weapon, 

28. OIL TRAP 

A wall-to-wall pit trap is hidden under a pool 
of oil in this area, Because the trap is hidden, 
the first characters to cross the trap have no 
chance of detecting it before falling through 
it. These characters fall 30 feet and take 3d6 
points of damage. They are also covered from 
head to foot with oil. 

Characters who have fallen through the 
trap are in a dank, 10-foot-wide passageway. 
This pit trap and the traps described in areas 
20 and 24 are all part of a subterranean pas 
sageway that leads to area 29, 

29. CAVERN OF STATUES 

Characters arrive in this tunnel area by fall 
ing through pit traps in areas 20 + 24, and 28, 
or by coming through the rubble in the south 
wall of area 32, Just as characters approach 
this area, read the following boxed text to the 
players. 


A louse jumble of rocks blocks the north 
end of this tunnel. 

To the south, the tunnel widens to an 
opening of 25 feet Standing in the 30- 
foot-tall cavern are twelve humanoid 
statues made of dark stone. Six statues 
have human heads, and six have vulture 
heads. All of the stames faee south. The 
cavern appears to continue to the south. 


The six vulture-headed statues were once 
Hook Horrors. Basilisks that live to the south 
beyond this cavern petrified these creatures. 
The human-headed statues are living rock 
statues. They do not attack if the characters 
leave them alone. If the characters go on to 
attack the basilisks in area 29a, the statues 
attack the characters as they move back 
through this area.

The statues have no treasure. 

If characters successfully search for a secret 
door along the north wall of this cavern, tell 
them that they have picked their way through 
the rubble into another cavern (area 32). 

29a. Basilisk cavern: 


A short, 10-foot-wide tunnel leads from 
the cavern of statues to a 30-foot-wide 
dead-end cave. A deep pool of water, par 
tially covered by an oil slick, lies in the 
center of the cave. A pile of treasure sits at 
the far side of the pool. 


The pool is the home of two basilisks. If any 
characters come within 10 feet of the trea 
sure, the basilisks attack immediately.

heart-shaped stone that gives off a green 
glow. The stone removes curses from any 
character wiio touches it. The stone also heals 
a maximum of 25 hit points. The stone has 
three charges left, 

30. OIL SLIDE 


The footing here is treacherous. Oil drips 
From the walls and runs down, forming 
shallow pools all over the floor. A large 
opening lies in the center of the door at the 
end of this tunnel. 


Characters must stand in pools of oil if they 
want to look through the hole. Characters 
who stand in the oil here automatically slip 
and fall, sliding down into a cold, dark lake 
(area 38), 

31. BLACK PUDDING 


Black oil floods this area, The oily slime 
coats the walls and ceiling, and the od 
pools that stand on the floor are at least a 
foot deep. 


A black pudding makes its home here. Char 
acters can avoid fighting the pudding only by 
flying over this area, or by devising some 
other way to move through without touching 
the walls, floor, or celling-

they find one* tell them that they have picked 
their way through the rubble into another 
cavern (area 29). 

33, TRIP WIRE 

Dahnakriss has placed a trip wire just below 
the surface of the oil pool here, ff a character 
walks through the oil, the trap is triggered 
and the oil bursts into flames (see Traveling 
Through the Tunnels for information about 
oil damage}. 

34, HYDRA LAIR 


The tunnel here is very wet and foub 
smelling. The passageway opens up into a 
small cavern filled by a murky pool. Sud 
denly a large reptilian head pops out of 
the water, swaying on a long, flexible 
neck. Then another head pops out. Then 
another, and another, and yet another! 


This lair is the home of six five-headed 
hydrae. Only one hydra surfaces at a time. If 
characters have already fallen into the lake 
(area 38), they may already have fought 
some of these monsters.

33. SLIDE TRAP 

If characters step onto this trap, they fall 
through the door and slide down an oily 
chute. The chute deposits the characters in a 
large, icy lake (area 38). 

If characters walk along the east wall of this 
tunnel, they do not fall through the trap. 

36. BRIDGE OVER NASTY WATER 

Characters who walk down the center of this 
bridge are able to safely cross it. Any charac 
ter who walks on the left or right side of the 
bridge falls into the lake (area 38), The sides 
Of the bridge arc rigged to collapse whenever 
someone walks on them.

characters 1 view from the tenter of the 
bridge, looking coward the west. 

37. SUPPLY/DRAINAGE ROOM 

Show the players Illustration 7 if the charac 
ters enter this room from the north, 

A spiral staircase made of stone connects 
this room to area 71 on Level Hi: The Wiz 
ard^ Home. 

If Dahnakriss or Tharadodus the Wizard 
floods area 71, die water washes down the 
staircase into this room. Any character on the 
steps when water rushes down from above 
takes 4d6 points of damage. The water then 
carries the character into a drainage area that 
lies to the south of the stairs in this room. 
This drainage area empties into the lake 
(area 38). 

Two metal doors stand along the east wall 
of this room. These heavily-latched doors 
open into a supply room. The doors are wiz 
ard locked shut. If characters get the doors 
open. read the following boxed text to the 
players. 


Thu stench of carrion fills the air. A body 
lies among several boxes and kegs. The 
person has obviously been dead a very 
long time. A lantern, a book, and a quill 
lie next to the body. 


The book is a diary of sorts. It contains the 
final thoughts of the man who now lies dead 
here. He was a thief in search of his master 
Hr came here to impress his master by find 
ing Dahnakriss" hideout, which, he writes, 
no one else has ever found. 

He writes how t upon entering these tun 
nels, he found a secret door in the north wall 
of the first left hallway. He climbed a flight of 


stairs to a landing. He writes that he chose to 
descend another set of stairs that led east from 
the landing. There was no exit at the bottom 
of these stairs. Hu searched for and found a 
secret entrance into a room with a spiral stair- 
ease and a large drain, A supply room was 
built into the room's east wall. 

The thief then relates how he left the room 
and walked north to a stone bridge. There he 
stared ai a beautiful underground lake where 
water fell from the wall and ceiling into a 
deep pool. Suddenly, the bridge gave way 
and he Tell into the icy, oil-covered water. A 
large lizard having many heads then slithered 
into the water The thief, covered with oil, 
was barely able to climb up the sheer rock 
wall and Onto the bridge. As he examined the 
Trapped bridge, he heard humming coming 
from the north. A robed figure approached, 
and he fled south, back into the room. He hid 
in the supply room and kepi the door cracked 
open so he could see who was coming. 

The robed man entered the room, he 
writes, and walked past the supply room 
doors* Then the doors slammed shut! Thu 
man had kicked them shut from behind. 
Then the man cast a spell in some unknown 
language, and said, "Rest well, intruder, for 
you shall spend ihe rest of your days whhin!" 
And then he left. The voice seemed vaguely 
familiar to the thief. 

The thief found that he could not escape. 
He eventually ate all of the food and drank all 
of the ale that was stored in the room His 
laiucrn was running low. 

On the final pages of his book, the thief 
writes about his initiation into the Thieves 4 
Guild. He was teleported, hu writes* to an 
unknown place by a great mage and Dahna 
kriss the Master Thief. They appeared in a 
large room lit only by a huan-shaped stone 
that gave oil'a bright red glow The mage cast 
a spell and disappeared. The Master Thief 
put bis right hand on the stone and put his left 
hand to his lips to command silence. Red rays 
from the stone !>eamed out between the fin 
gers of the Master's hand. 

The thief felt sick. The Master, he felt, was 
entering his mind Then the thief blacked 
out. He writes that he awoke in a room at an 
inn. He later discovered that the room was 
his for 1 year He was now a full apprentice in 
the Thieves' Guild. 

The thief's story ends here. If characters 
search the room, they find the thiefs short 
sword r two daggers, a coil of rope (30 feet), 
and a pouch containing 10 gems (each worth 
100 gp).

ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


38. ICY LAKE 

This lake is deep and very told. A thin slick of 
oil covers the water. Ef anyone falls into the 
lake* a hydra from area 34 slithers from its 
lair and splashes into the water. The hydra 
attacks 10 rounds after characters fall into the 
water. 

Most characters can escape the lake only 
by climbing one of the steep banks to the 
north* although thieves are able to climb the 
walls, A light-emitting fungus that feeds on 
oil keeps this area dimly illuminated. 

39. ROPER 

This cave is the home of a roper that guards 
the entrance to the wellevator beyond (area 
41). 

Roper: AC 0; HD 12***; hp 50; MV 30' 
(1Q # ); #AT 1 biie/6 strands; D 5-30/ 
weakness; Save F10; ML 10; AL C; 
XP 3,500 

You may use the RAGING ROPER(tm) Benda 
ble Monster produced by TSR, Inc. for this 
encounter. For a complete description of 
these monsters, turn to the New Monsters 
section at the end of the adventure. 

The roper has hidden its treasure nearby. It 
includes 204ep, 38 gp* 151 pp* a 500 gp gem r 
and a black heart-shaped stone. The stone 
docs not glow or do anything special. 

40. BYPASS 

This tunnel runs to the north of the roper's 
cave (area 39). It is empty. 

41. THE WELLEVATOR 

The wellevator is a platform that floats on 
water. The water rises and falls to match the 
various levels of Dahnakriss the Master 
Thief's home, 

Tharadodus the Wizard had the wellevator 
constructed lor Dahnakriss many years ago. 
lie conjured an elemental to hollow out the 
space for the wellevator. The ejemental then 
opened up a breach in the top of the difT so 
that the water flowing over die cliff could be 
used to fiU the wellevator from above, A mag- 
ically controlled waff of force regulates the 
flow of water into the wellevator. 

Golems created by Tharadodus budi the 
large platform that rides the water in die 
shaft. Air Oils a space just beneath the plat 
form, cushioning the platform as it rises and 
falls on the water's surface. 

The water can be set at four levels; Levd I: 
The Tunnels of Death; Level II: Frost Giants' 


Lair; Level Eli; The Wizard's Home; and 
Level IV: Home of the Heartstone. 

Each level has a door, except level II, On 
level II, the platform stops just below the 
opening in the frost giants' bathroom (area 
47a). IT characters go from the platform to 
the giants' bathroom, go to area 47a. 

Water constantly flows from the breach in 
the top of the cliff down the walls of the Wel 
le vator shaft, A waterfall from the bottom of 
the shaft empties into the lake (area 3S), bal 
ancing the amount of water that flows in from 
above. When the water level is set to rise to 
another level* more water flows from the top* 
pushing the platform up. When the water 
levd is set to lower to another level, more 
water flows out of the bottom of the shaft into 
the lake. 

When the water level is set for a specific 
level, the water sinks below die door on that 
level. The door ihen opens easily inward. A 
narrow gap of 2 feet separates the platform 
and the surrounding wall, The door automat 
ically doses if the water level rises, 

Three glowing gems sit in the center of the 
platform. The gems are red, white, and blue. 
If a character touches the red gem, the plat 
form rises to the next level. If a character 
touches the white gem, the platform lowers 
one levd. If a character touches the blue gem, 
an alarm sounds, alerting Tharadodus and 
Dahnakriss that intruders are near. In this 
case, one of them immediately shuts off the 
wellevator. The platform then sinks several 
feet below Level I and dlls outward as it hits 
bottom. Any characters on the platform at 
this time fall into the lake (area 38), and take 
3d6 points of damage from the fall. The plat 
form then rises to Level IV. 

See the Cliff Diagram for a side view of the 
wellevator. 

42* WELLEVATOR CONTROL BOXES 

These small boxes are found on all levels of 
Dahnakriss the Master Thiefs cliff home. 
They activate the wellevator (area 41). Each 
is mounted on the wall, 5 feet from the floor. 
A l hick metal door stands just beyond each of 
these boxes. These doors actually open onto 
the wellevator platform. 

IT the door on a certain level is knocked 
open, and if the water level is currently above 
that door, water bursts forth, knocking char 
acters back. The water docs 3d6 points of 
damage to each character. If characters do 
not dose the door or gel out of the rushing 
water's way, they drown. 

Each of the control boxes contains a magi 
cal gem that regulates the force field control 
ling the water* As soon as a character touches 
the gem, it begins to glow, and the water 


begins to rise or lower to ihat level. When ihe 
water reaches that levd* the gem stops glow 
ing. 

Level II: 

Frost Giants' Lair 

(Use Map 4.) 

Encounter key 

43. ENTRANCE TO THE FROST 
GIANTS' LAIR 


This huge tunnel is 20 feet wide and 20 
feet high. Colorful paintings of frost giants 
dot the tunnel walls. The paintings show 
the giants throwing large pieces of meat to 
various winged monsters. One scene 
shows a giant earth creature carving a 
cave m the side of a chlT, while a chimera 
hovers above the cave entrance. 

A huge pair of double doors stands at 
the end of the 80-fooukmg tunnel, The 
doors are made of sturdy wood and arc 
crossed by iron bands. Heavy iron 
pullrings, 14 inches in diameter* are cen 
tered on each door. The pullrings are at 
least 9 feet from the ground. Another 8 
feet above the pullrings, dark horizontal 
slits* each 14 inches wide by 2 feet high, 
have been cut into the center of each door. 


This area is the entryway to the frost giant's 
lair. Four giants live within. 

Dahnakriss the Master Thief has made a 
deal with the frost giants. He has provided 
the giants with a luxurious dwelling, and he 
actively acquires winged creatures for the 
giants, who like to use large "birds" for hunt 
ing. In return, ihe giants guard the diftTrom 
invaders. 

The doors here are bolted from the inside. 
If characters make loo much noise as they 
approach these doors* a giant peers through 
one of the eye slits and tells the characters to 
go away If characters cannot convince the 
giants to open the doors* they must either 
chop a hole in the doors or use magic to open 
them. To open other doors in the frost giants* 
lair, it takes a combined Strength of 40 
points. 

44, HALLWAY 

If characters used force to enter this area, 
three of the giams attack, throwing boulders 
at the characters (the giants take the boulders 
from area 45)* If a character utters any words 
of magic after entering this area, the giants 
stop throwing boulders and run to grab 
scrolls of prof erf/on from magic, which are

ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 




The gems are continual light gems. They are 
cemented into the east and west walls. Each is 
centered 20 feet up. Characters would have 
to spend at least 1 hour to pry a stone loose. 
Each gem is worth LOO gp, 

Inside the closet along the north wall is a 
crossbow trap. The trap can only be triggered 
by levers located on the walls in areas 45 and 
46 (marked M LT on Map 4). The trap fires 
t wo valleys of six giant-size bolts, each aimed 
at die south door. Each bolt does 3d6 points of 
damage, and should be considered to have 
been fired by a 5 Hit Dice creature. One pull 
of the lever releases one volley of bolts.

A gigantic wooden table surrounded by 
four stools stands near the north wall. 

In the southeast comer of the room, the 
carcass of a freshly slain moose lies on a 
high table. A huge iron cleaver is imbed 
ded in the table, A pile of throwing boul 
ders lies under the table.

The throwing boulders are too large for char 
acters to throw The metal cabinet is a cold 
meat storage locker. If characters open one of 
the metal doors to the locker, they find that it 
is full of rotting meat. Characters in the 
kitchen when the locker is opened must make 
a saving throw vs* death ray. Characters who 
fail their throw- become ill for ld4 turns. 
These characters have a -1 penalty to their hit 
rolls for the rolled number of turns.

Four crude chairs are arranged in a circle 
in the center of this room. A small pile of 
throwing boulders lies next to each chair. 

Several torches light this clean room. 
Color drawings of Hying creatures grace 
the smooth stone walls of this room. 

Several large cockroaches scurry 
around near a door in the western wall. 


Cliff Diagram 


Smooth stone walls rise to a 30-foot-high 
ceiling in this area. Two gems illuminate 
this massive, 80-foot by 30-foot room. 

A large wooden closet stands out from 
the center of the north wall. Several giant- 
size fur cloaks and vests hang front pegs 
along the south wall. Three pairs of huge 
fur boots lie beneath the cloaks. 

Several giant-size weapons also line the 
south wall. Two wooden dubs and one 
hammer are on the floor* leaning against 
the wall. Four iron-tipped spears, two 
bows, and two quivers of arrows hang 
from pegs above the other weapons. 


stashed in a vest that hangs along the south 
wall, 

If any character uses magic to open the 
doors from area 43, the giants are standing in 
a far comer of the room, clutching their 
scrolls. 


If characters did not encounter the giants in 
area 44, they meet three of them here. See 
area 44 for the giants' statistics. There is 
nothing of value in this room. 

The drawings are of a dragon (drawn in 
white chalk); a three-headed flying creature 
(chimera); a flying* lionlike creature that has 
a spiked tail and a man's face (manticore); 
and a large, eaglelike creature that has a 
lion's hindquarters (griffon). There are "rv 
eral different renditions of this last creature.

ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


Another drawing depicts a clifTtop next to a 
waterfall. The drawing shows a great wooden 
cage standing open atop the difT. A robed 
human stands near the open cage, his arms 
outstretched. Several other large cages have 
been drawn in the background, Each appears 
to hold a great winged creature of some sort. 

tf characters lift up any of the chairs in this 
room, they find a scroll that gives instructions 
for working the wellevator (area 41). If char 
acters find this scroll t show the players Illus 
tration 8. 

Characters who can read Giant can deci 
pher the crude runic letters on the scroll. The 
first word is "up " the second is "down " and 
the third is "flush." 

47, BATHROOM 

Show the players Illustration 9. 


A great fountain adorns the north wall of 
this huge t torch-lit room. Water gushes 
from the mouth of a three-dimensional 
relief. The relief is of a bearded frost 
giant's head. The icy water spills down 
into a semicircular, 30-foot-wide pool. A 
6-foot-high, smooth stone wall surrounds 
the pool. 

Two 8-foot-tall cylinders stand on each 
side of the pool. The floor around them is 
very wet and slippery, 

Four large, sheepskin-like pelts hang on 
pegs along the south wall. Large doors 
lead out of the east and west walls of this 
room. 

A large wexxten cabinet stands in the 
southeast comer of the room, its door 
slightly ajar. 


This is the giants' bathroom. The water in 
the pool flows out through a drain hole in its 
floor. If characters peer into the pool, they see 
a large, flat rock on the bottom. The giants 
use this rock to plug the drain hole. 

The 8-foot cylinders are hollow; they hold 
the giants' soap. 

The wooden cabinet is 12 feet tall and 10 
feet wide. Folded towels rest on an upper 
shelf inside the cabinet In the lower part of 
the cabinet, a long, wide towel hangs draped 
over a rod. Two huge bottles and a dirty 
sponge lie on Lhe cabinet floor. The bottles 
arc partially filled with cleaning solution. 
Characters who ingest any of this solution 
suffer 4d6 points of poison damage. 

The towd in the lower part of the cabinet 


hides a secret, human-size door. Dahnakriss 
uses this door when he wants to use the wel- 
lcvator on this level of his home (see area 41 
for a complete description of the wedevator). 

4 7a. The water spout: If anyone lowers the 
wellevator level to Level I: The Tunnels of 
Death or to Level II (this level), the water 
stops flowing from the sculpture of the frost 
giant's head. If the wellevator level is at Level 
II, characters may climb up the sculpture's 
beard and into its mouth. The oval, 4-foot- 
high mouth hole opens onto the wcllevator's 
circular platform (area 41). 

48, THE INSIDE OUTHOUSE 


A 5-foot-high, 5-foot-wide platform rises 
up 10 feet against the east wall. 


Two circular holes have been cut into the top 
of the platform. Each hole is 3 feet in diame 
ter. If a character climbs up the platform and 
looks into one of the holes, he sees nothing 
but darkness. The sound of running water 
comes from far below. 

49. SECRET PASSAGEWAY 

This long hallway runs behind the giants' 
kitchen. Three secret doors lead to and from 
this passage The northwest door leads to the 
giants' bathroom (area 47), The southeast 
door stands at the bottom of two flights of 
stairs. This door opens into area 37. The 
southwest door stands at the bottom of two 
more sets of stairs. The door leads out of the 
cliff through areas 19 and 11. 

A small, 6-inch-square box is set into the 
northeast comer of the passageway, 5 feet 
from the floor. It is one of the wellevator con 
trol boxes {area 42). 

50. HALLWAY 


A pair of dark brown boots stands against 
the south wall in this hallway. Large cock 
roaches skitter about the floors, walls, and 
ceiling. A large wooden cabinet stands 
along the north wall. Doors lead into the 
hallway from the east and west. 


A crossbow trap, similar to the one in area 
44, is set in the cabinet. A lever in area 5t 
triggers the trap. 


51. GIANTS' REDROOM/WORKKOOM 


Four beds covered by huge animal pelts 
stand along the walls of this room. Three 
beds line Lhe west wall, and one stands in 
the northeast comer. Two large tables 
stand against the easL wall, A few stools 
rest before each table, A shelf holding rolls 
of paper is bolted into the wall above the 
southernmost table. Tall, narrow paint 
urns are scattered about the floor. Long 
sticks protrude from each urn. Crude 
pens and brushes litter the tables' sur 
faces. 

Wood shavings carpet the floor. Four 
tree trunk sections rest against the north 
wall. Partially completed statues of giants, 
trolls, and upright, vulture-headed crea 
tures stand between the beds along the 
north wall. Various carving tools are scat 
tered about the room, A torch is mounted 
on the wall over the northernmost table. 

Two large* covered vats rest under this 
table. A large mastodon rug lies on the 
floor in the center of the room. The walls 
and ceiling of this room are beautifully 
painted with pictures of flying creatures 
and birds. 

Sitting on hts bed in the northwest cor 
ner* a frost gianL whittles away on a long 
piece of wood. 


The frost gianl in this room is deaf, but he 
sees the characters as they enter. He throws 
large chunks of wood at the characters. If the 
characters still come fully into the room, he 
attacks* using a huge iron-headed axe. If 
some characters stay in the hallway (area 
50), the giant pulls the lever* releasing die 
crossbow trap in the hallway. The lever is 
located 14 feet up the east wall.

If characters lift up all of the stumps that line 
the north wall, a leather sack falls out of the 
last stump The sack contains 943 gp and 167 
pp. This is no easy discovery, however. Each 
stump weighs 500 pounds. 

tf characters search under the bed in the 
southwest comer of the room, they find 
giants' clothing, old boots, a bloodstained 
cloak, and a wooden box. The box appears to 
contain 5*000 gp. However* the gold pieces 
arc actually gold-colored pieces of iron. 


23 






ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


If a character manages to climb up on the 
shelf above the table, he finds four wooden 
boxes and a large roll of paper tied wiLh rope, 
Each box contains the feathers and claws of a 
different +< bird." The roll of paper is 5 feet 
long and contains three huge scrolls. The 
innermost scroll is cursed, and it turns the 
character who reads it into a pixie for 1 week. 
A remove curse spell immediately returns the 
character to normal form, however. The 
other two scrolls contain charm monster 
spell s. 

The two vats beneath the northernmost 
table are 5 feel high and made of stone. It 
takes the combined Strength of three charac 
ters to slide one of the stone lids aside. The 
north vat contains gray ooze. IF characters 
put anything in the vat, or if they leave the 
vat open for 5 minutes, the creature begins 
oozing out.

52, STORAGE ROOM 


Large boxes, sacks of grain, and huge 
kegs of ale are stacked here. Dozens of 
piles of furs, hides, and sponges stand 
around the room. 


The only thing of interest in this room is a 
wooden box that sits near the door in the west 
wall. If characters open the box, they find 
that it is filled with straw, A ceramic bottle 
capped by a wooden stopper is buried 
beneath the straw. The bottle holds a gallon 
of noxious liquid, A black spider is painted 
neatly on the side of the bottle, which is filled 
with black widow spider antidote. 


53, BOULDER CAVERN 


A large pile of throwing boulders lies in 
the center of this cave. Webs fill the room 
from one end to the other. What appears 
to be an exit to the south is obscured by 
weba. 


As soon as a character enters this room, a 
black widow spider drops from above. Two 
more spiders wait in webs above the boulder 
pile. The boulders are too large for characters 
to throw.

The spiders normally feed on surges that live 
in the southern part of this cave. They are 
delighted at the prospect of a more filling

Large, sticky webs block the cave's south' 
era exit. These webs are the equivalent of a 
magic-user's web spell. If characters bum 
away the webs, the stirges from the area to 
the south swarm into the cave. Many of them 
may fly into area 52, if characters leave the 
door to that area open. The characters should 
not become aware of the stirges until after 
they have burned away the webs . If they do 
burn the webs, read the following boxed text 
to the players. 


Out of the darkness beyond, a deadly 
swarm of flying creatures flies into die 
cave. The beasts look like crosses between 
giant bats and mosquitos.

and bite him. ff a stirge misses its hit roll, it 
flies away* temporarily out of the character's

fly into area 52 and find characters there.

cones. 

If characters inspect the 2-foot-wide holes, 
they see that, after a distance of about 8 feet, 
the holes shrink to 6 inches in diameter. 
These openings transmit the sound of the 
Dragonnes' roars to Dahnakrm and Thara- 
dodus. The small tunnels created by the holes 
extend back to Dahnakriss 1 residence (area 
88), and Tharadodus' residence (area 69),

of the hallway. 

Two 10-foot-wkle sections of illusionary 
wall make up part of the wall that borders 
area 65, Both sections open into area 65, If a 
character touches one of these illusionary 
walls, the wall disappears and the amber 
golems in area 65 attack. 

The door opening into area 66 is locked. 
Once characters unlock it, the door may 
swing inward or outward. If the characters 
swung the door inward, the illusion ary walls 
bordering area 65 vanish, and the amber 
golems in Lhat area emerge and attack. 

A large eye ls pain Led on the door to area 
69. If characters approach this door, Thara 
dodus may cast a spell at them through a 
small hole in the pupil of the eye* 

A false door stands at the south end of the 
hallway, If a character opens the door, a wall 
of stone begins pushing out from the door

quest* you must leave. I am a very power 
ful man who wishes to be left alone. 
Return to the well and descend now with 
your Jives, or ] shall make golems of vou 
all!" 


If the characters immediately attack, the wiz 
ard casts a 14 Hit Dice lightning bolt at them, 
Those who make their saving throws suffer l /2 
damage. The wizard then warns the charac 
ters again. If rhey do not take his advice, he 
casts another lightning bolt. The wizard con 
tinues to cast spells at the characters* until 
they either approach or retreaL, 

If the characters strike or touch the magic- 
uscr. he disappears. He was only a projected 
image Tharadodus is actually sitting in his 
workshop (area 661, The wizard knew when 
the characters entered his home, and he cast a 
clairvoyance spell to monitor the characters' 
actions. When the characters entered the 
hallway, he cast a projected image spell. 

If characters talk to the image and do noi 
approach it* the wizard talks to them and 
freely explains what is going on: Dahnakriss 
the Master Thief provides him with funds 
and special items with which he can do his 
research, In return, the wizard writes scrolls 
for Dahnakriss* and he has conjured elemen- 
rah to help build this hideaway Many times, 
he has aided Dalinakriss in selecting new 
members for the local Thieves' Guild. The

defeat the wizard and obtain his spell book. 
This should only be a remote possibility* how 
ever. After a few rounds of battle* the wizard 
again insists that the characters leave* while 
they still have their lives. If they do not, the 
wizard attacks for another round, weakening 
the characters further, and then retreats to his 
sanctuary vault (area 67). 

A total of 89 gp is on the floor. The rest of 
the items in the room are used for magical 
research. Magic-users who search here for 6

so that the giant fits perfectly into it. The 
giant*s eyes stare straight ahead. 

To the east, die hallway stretches for 60 
feet before ending in darkness. The ceil 
ing here is 20 feet high. Hundreds of 1- 
inch holes dot the floor and ceiling. A 
6-inch-wide curb runs along each wall, 
rising 2 inches above the floor. Hie hall 
way seems to slope upward slightly. 


The Curb is too narrow for characters to walk 
along normally. A character cannot walk on 
the curbs by straddling the hallway, either, as 
the hallway is 10 feel wide. If characters waul 
to walk along the curbs, they must come up 
with a unique manner of doing so. Use your 
judgment concerning the characters 1 success

golem steps from its niche and uses its hands 
to push the roller back up the hallway. It 
pushes the roller until it locks in place at area 
84. The golem walks only on the curbs. It can 
do so because it is 16 feet tall and is very 
strong. 

The golem cannot talk. If a character hits

This pit trap extends across the hallway from 
curb to curb. If a character walks on the trap, 
he falls through it into an icy stream that 
flows rapidly into the reservoir (area 91). 
The trapdoor springs shut as soon as some 
one has fallen through it. Characters cannot 
detect the trapdoor's presence by tapping on 
the floor, because the trapdoor does not open 
unless at least 100 pounds of weight crosses it. 

Allow each character a 50% chance to 
jump back or get pulled back from the trap 
door before falling through it. 

The icy stream runs down from an opening

ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


the stone roller at area 84 starts rolling slowly 
down the hallway at the rate of 20 feet per 
round . If characters start the roller down the 
hallway, Dahnakriss is alerted to the charac 
ters* presence in his home. 

Because the roller is so far away, the char 
acters do not immediately see it. However, 
they do hear the sound of grinding stone 
growing louder and louder. 

The only things that might possibly stop 
the roller are a conjured elemental > a bronze- 
golem, or a disintegrate spell. To avoid the 
massive stone, the characters must either fly 
or /evirate. They may also duck into the room 
in area 79. 

The roller is 15 fee* in diameter. Hand 
holds are carved into its outer circumference 
at 3-foot intervals. The stone rolls along the 
curb so that it docs not get stuck in the other 
traps in the hallway. 

When the roller reaches the west end of the 
hallway, the bronze golem begins pushing it 
back to area 84 at the rate of 10 feet per 
round. 

Any character caught under the roller loses 
most of his height and all of his hit points. 

Characters may find a safe spot to avoid 
the roller at the feet of die golem (area 75), as 
the roller stops JO feet in from of the golem. 
The spot won't be safe for long, Lhough, as 
any characters at the golem's feet when it

the door to this room. The door is made of 
wood, and has no knob or pullring. A 
wooden dial rests in the center of the door, 
and an arrow pointing to the left has been 
scratched on the dial. 


If characters turn the dial so the arrow points 
to the right, they can push the door open. If 
they do so, read the following boxed text to

into the ceiling. This trapdoor has a circu 
lar dial similar to the one on the door to 
the room. Dark scratches mar the ceiling 
near the trapdoor. A 2-foot-square iron 
grate lies in the floor along the east wall. 
The sound of rushing water gurgles up 
from below. 


As soon as characters enter this room, the 
door springs shut and water starts rushing in 
from holes in the northwest comer of the ceil 
ing. The characters could not see these holes 
because they had been covered with fungus. 

The iron grate is actually a drain. This 
drain cannot handle all of the water that is 
rushing in, so the water level in the room 
begins to rise at the rate of 1 fool per round. 
The water level continues to rise until it 
reaches 14 feet. It rises no higher than that. 
Characters wearing plate armor sink if they 
do not take the armor off. All other characters 
can tread water.

from area 75 slowly pushes the roller back up 
the hallway after it reaches the west end 
When the roller is in place, it blocks the 
entrance to a locked door that leads south Into 
the Home of the Heartsttme (area 87). 

85. BRONZE GOLEM 

This bronze golem is hot to the touch. He 
does not move at all until all of Lhe characters 
have passed through the door that leads to 
area 86. Once characters have passed, the 
golem slams the door shut and stands in front 
of it. allowing no one to pass. The golem does 
not move away from the door for any reason. 

If a character hits the golem with edged 
weapons, the attacking character must make 
a saving throw vs. death ray. If the charac 
ter's throw fails, he takes 2dG points of dam 
age from the golem's fiery blood. See area 75 
for bronze golem statistics,

A secret door in the west wal! of this hallway

87, HOME OF THE HEARTSTONE 

Show the players Illustration 12 if the charac 
ters enter this room from the north. If charac 
ters enter this room from area 89, ihey are 
probably charing Dahnakriss. However, the 
characters still have the same encounter in 
this area as they would if they had entered 
from the north. The only change would be 
that Dahnaight would not be present.

ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


Read the following boxed text to the play 
ers as the characters enter the room. 


A burst of hot air rushes out of the room, 
A bright glow fills the hallway, and burn 
ing red light bathes the room. There is no 
furniture in this room, except for a semi 
circular platform that stands against the 
south wall. 

The platform stands 1 foot off the floor. 
A circular dais rises 2 feet from the center 
of the platform. Atop the dais rests a black 
stone obelisk. 

The obelisk appears to be an ornately 
carved totem. A sculpted hand rests atop 
the totem, its palm open. Imbedded in the 
palm of the hand is a glowing, red stone. 
The stone is heart-shaped. Two bronze 
statues stand on each side of the dais. 
They do not move. 

A feeling of warmth seems to rush 
through the room. A voice coming from 
the direction of the obelisk says, "Enter, 
brave ones. have run the gauntlet and 
so deserve to bathe in the healing rays of 
the heart.' 1 


Tell the characters at this point that they 
indeed begin to feel very good, and that their 
wounds begin to heal. Then continue reading 
this description to the players. (If characters 
enter from area 89, skip this boxed text. TM 
the characters that red humanoid figures 
begin to form in die red light of the heart- 
stone,) 


Minutes later, a dark form steps from 
behind the obelisk. The human figure is 
thin and muscular. He has a short beard 
and mustache. He places one hand on the 
heartstone, As shadowy fingers of dark- 
ness divide the room, red humanoid fig 
ures begin to form in the red light. 


The bearded figure is Dahnakriss. 

Dahnakriss the Master Thief: AC 9; T 14; hp 
49; MV 120 # (40*); #AT 1 weapon; D 
by weapon; SaveTl4; ML 12; AL C 

Dahnakriss may attack with a sword *1 
[locate objects), a poison-tipped dagger *2 , 
and a scroll with two 14 Hit Dice lightning 
bolts. His defenses include leather +3, a ring 
of protection */, a scroll of teleport t and a 
ring of spell turning , 

The characters begin to fed sick. Whai feel 
like electric shocks wrack their bodies. The 
humanoid figures have gelled into exact 
duplicates of the characters. 


All of the characters have healed 100%, 
The wave of nausea passes, and they feel bet' 
ter. They know that some mysterious force 
has healed them, 

A sudden compulsion overtakes the char 
acters, Each character feels drawn to lighting 
hi$ double. Characters cannot resist this com 
pulsion, no matter how hard they fight it. 
The magic of the heartstone has caused this 
awful dilemma. 

Each character's double has an alignment 
opposite to that character's alignment. Law 
ful and Neutral characters have Chaotic dou 
bles, while Chaotic characters have Lawful 
doubles. 

Secretly tell the characters who can cast 
spells that they suddenly remember all of the 
day's spells, but that they should not tell this 
to the other characters. 

Just before the characters engage their 
doubles in combat, read the following boxed 
text to the players (ignore if characters 
entered from area 89), 


The dark figure standing near the obelisk 
mutters* fl Darn! Never thought I'd have 
to leave the stone behind. Guess I'll have 
to steal it again . " Then he disappears 

behind a secret door in the south wall and 
says to the golems, L 'Let no one pass 
through this door!" 


The characters' compulsion to attack then- 
doubles grows to fever pitch. Loyalty to the 
quest now depends upon each character's 
alignment. Explain to Lawful characters that 
if they defeat their doubles, their alignment 
remains Lawful, and they continue to help 
the group fulfill its quest. Explain to Chaotic 
characters that if they defeat their doubles, 
their alignment remains Chaotic, and they 
wish to take the heartstone for themselves. If 
a Lawful character loses to his double, that 
character's alignment becomes Chaotic. If a 
Chaotic character loses to his double, that 
character's alignment becomes Lawful. 

From this point on t characters are unable 
to distinguish their friends from their friends' 
doubles. Characters should not discuss their 
actual alignments from now on, 

Duplicate characters have all of the same 
equipment and abilities as ihe actual charac 
ters, except that duplicates have 10 fewer hit 
points than actual characters. Once a charac 
ter or double is slain, the victim vanishes for 
ever. But, if the double is victorious, that 
character's alignment changes, and he gains 
back all of his hit points (including the ID 
point bonus characters had over their dou 
bles), Victorious characters are fully healed, 
but not until after all of the battles have 
ended. 


IF* for some reason, a character and his 
double are prevented from fighting, the dou 
ble vanishes mysteriously. 

Run these unique combats so that in each 
case, either a character or his double survives 
the battle. Characters may suffer a change of 
alignment because of this encounter, but they 
should not be totally eliminated, 

As soon as a character has resolved his 
individual battle, he may either pursue 
Dahnakriss or try to steal the heartstone for 
himself (depending on his alignment). 

With some difficulty, the characters are 
able to remove the heartstone from the hand 
atop the obelisk. Any character who touches 
the sLone has the power of ESP , and is able to 
read the thoughts nf the other characters. The 
character touching the stone is then able to 
indirectly determine if any of the characters 
have new alignments. The character cannot 
figure out any of the stone's other powers. 
The two bronze golems defend to the death 
the secret door that leads to area 88, but they 
do not stray from the door. A hole in the wall 
next to the secret door also leads to area 88 
Dahnakriss uses this hole if he needs to escape 
the heartstone room in gaseous form, 

Brornce Golems (2): AG 0; HD 20**; hp 1(10,

D 3-30 + special; Save F10; ML 12; AL 
N; XP 4,300 

These golems have no treasure. 

As the characters leave this room for the 
last lime, the heartstone fully heals them one 
last time. 

SB. LAIR OF THE MASTER THIEF 


Riches and rarities fill this luxurious 
room. The sweet smell of incense fills Lhe 
air. Expensive tapestries and carvings 
hang on the wall, and exotic furs cover the 
floor. A carved wooden bed sits in the 
northwest comer, covered with fine silk 
and satin sheets, 

A metal lever is set into the south wall. 
It is in the UP position. 


If characters pull the metal lever down, the 
trapdoor in area 90 flies open, and water 
from the reservoir (area 91) washes anyone 
in areas 90, 71, and 37 into the lake (area 
38). If the secret door to area 89 is open, 
water floods that area also. 

If the characters enter this room from area 
87. Dahnakriss is gone. If the characters 
enter from area 89, Dahnakriss flees through 
areas 87, 86, 73, and 72, and heads for the 
wd Levator. He then tries to escape through 
the openings on the diff face. 


29 







ADVENTURE IN THE HEART OF THE CLIFF 


If Dahnakriss has had a chance to take his 
treasure (while characters are lighting their 
doubles in area 87), the characters may ran 
sack this room. The entire contents of the 
room is worth about 37,000 gp. There is no 
way that characters can get away with every 
thing in this room. Allow the characters eo 
take, any number of coins they can carry. 
There are no magic items in this room. Dis 
courage the characters from trying to get 
away with bulky objects like tapestries, how 
ever 

If Dahnakriss did not get a chance to take 
his treasure {if characters surprised him by 
entering from area 89), the characters may 
find a secret compartment in the east wall 
behind a tapestry. It contains a pouch that 
holds 123 gems (each worth 1,000 gp) ( a ring 
of x-ray vision t and a ring of invisibility. Also 
in the compart mem are hoofs of speed, and a 
neatly folded displacer cloak. 

Behind a tapestry that hangs on the south 
wail T a hole leads to area 89. 

89. THIEF'S PASSAGE 

This passage connects areas 88 and 90. A 
list-sized hole in the south wall leads to the 
Dragonnes' lair (area 54), A secret door in 
the west wall leads to area 90 Several boxes 
are stacked along the cast wall of this area. 

If he Ls in gaseous form, Dahnakriss may 
escape through the hole in the south wall to 
the Dragonnes* lair. 


Dahnakriss keeps the following items in 
boxes here: two 50-foot coils of rope T two 
days' worth of dried rations, two bottles of 
wine t a large blanket* a knife, a short sword 
*1 % iwo flasks of oil, a underbox, a torch, a 
leather backpack, four large sacks, and a very 
moldy loaf of what might have been bread. 

The large blanket is a /lying' carpet. Char 
acters must use detect magic to determine 
that the blanket is magic. Characters may use 
the same spell to determine that the rug's 
command word has been sewn with thread 
into a seam on the rug (make up your own 
command word for the blanket). 

Rolled up inside the blanket are mo com 
plete changes of men's clothing, and an ordi 
nary cloak. 

Ef Dahnakriss escaped through this area, 
the following items are no longer here: the 
Hying carpet , the clothes, the rations, the 
wine, and the short sword * 1. 

90, WATER TRAP 

A wide hallway leads from a landing in this 
area down toward the southwest A huge, fr- 
foot-square trapdoor is fit into the northwest 
wall of this room. The door is hinged at the 
top, and it is leaking water ai the bottom. The 
water drips down into a drainage crack in the 
floor. 

Ef any character tries to open the trapdoor, 
there is a 1 in 6 chance per round that it 
bursts open* gushing water and washing 


everyone down the hallway. The water car 
ries the characters to area 71* and then down 
to the lake (area 38). 

91- RESERVOIR 

The only way characters could have gotten 
into this area is by falling into a pit at area 76 
or 82, 

Allow characters who are in heavy armor 
to remove their armor and swim in the reser 
voir. These characters permanently lose their 
armor. 

A glowing fungus that grows on the 10- 
foot-high ceiling above the reservoir dimly 
Illuminates this area. 

The water that flow's into this area spills 
out over a rock rim to the west and in through 
a hole in the shaft at area 63, The water then 
spills down that shaft through a hole in the 
ceiling of the lake (area 38). 

A narrow tunnel runs from the reservoir 
south to a large, 6-foot-square wooden door. 
If a character swims underwater near this 
door, he finds pullrhains in the water. If he 
pulls the chains* the door opens* letting loose 
a torrent of rushing water. If this happens* 
anyone in the reservoir is washed all the way 
down to the underground lake (area 38), 
Each character who is washed dowm to the 
lake takes 2d6 points of damage. 

Opening this door only lowers the reser 
voir 5 feet* and this new water level is only 
temporary.

A roper is a long (or tall) bloblike creature 
that has one eye, a mouth below, and six long 
tentacles along the body. Ropers usually live 
in rocky caverns where they can rake the 
shape of tall rocks or stalagmites, but they 
may occasionally be found in woods, imitat 
ing trees, Ropers eat anything that moves, 
but they prefer humans and humanoids. 

A roper has six long tentacles. Each can 
shoot out 60 feet to grab prey, The touch of a 
roper's strand causes weakness, which cuts 
the victim's Strength in half for 3 turns (no 
saving throw). The strand wraps tightly 
around the prey, pulling the victim toward its 


mouth; only the bite causes damage. Charac 
ters can cut a strand only if a single blow from 
an edged magic weapon inflicts 5 or more 
points of damage. Such a blow makes that 
strand useless, but the damage does not count 
against the monster's hit points. Damaged 
strands grow back in 24 hours. 


Ropers are immune to all first, second, and 
third level spells, to all forms of cold and 
Hghming, and to normal and silver weapons. 
Characters may occasionally find treasure in 
ropers' stomachs. 


NEW MONSTERS 


The Dragonne has the head of a lion and the 
body of a small gold dragon. It fights wuh its 
claws and bite, but its greatest weapon is its 
fearsome roar 

Any character within 120 feet of a Dra 
gonne when it roars must make a saving 
throw vs. dragon breath or flee in fear for 2 
rounds, The Dragonne*3 roar deafens any 
creatures within 30 feet. Deafened creatures 
suffer a -2 penalty to their hit rolls for 2d6 
rounds. Dragonnes can roar once every 3 
rounds. Anyone who stays within 30 feet of a 
Dragonne after it roars again does not suffer 
any additional hit roll penalty, but he may 
suffer the original penalty for up to 12 
rounds. The Dragonne cannot bite in the 
same round it roars.

This large, powerful creature has a vulture- 
like head and thick, rhinohke skin. Its arms 
end in one sharp, hooking talon. It lives 
mostly in underground dungeons and cav 
erns. 

The Hook Horror's vision is poor, bur its 
hearing is extremely good (only a 1 in 10 
chance of being surprised). Hook Horrors do 
not speak, but communicate with each other 
by making codelike clicking noises with their 
tajons. Hook Horrors are not very smart. 


A dragonfly is a magical crossbreed between 
the insect form of the creature (1-4 inches 
long) and normal dragons of all types, A 
monster dragonfly appears similar TO a nor 
mal dragonfly, but is 3 to 4 feet long. There 
are five different colors of giant dragonfly 
each having a breath weapon that corres 
ponds to the larger dragon version (red-fire, 
blue-lightning, etc,). 

Unlike full-sized dragons, the breath 
weapon of a dragonfly inflicts only 1 point of 
daoiager per Hit Die of the monster, and each 
breath is only 3 feet long. Each breath nor 
mally affects only one creature, but a saving 
throw (for % h damage) is only allowed if the 
victim is not fighting the monster *" 
those in hand-to-hand combat have 111 J -7a V 
throw against the breath. Each dragonfly can 
breathe and bite during each round of com 
bat, and there is no limit to their number of 
breaths. 

Dragonflies dan around very quickly, and 
are hard to hit. They have only animal intelli 
gence, and never talk or use spells. They may 
be found nearly anywhere except mountains:
