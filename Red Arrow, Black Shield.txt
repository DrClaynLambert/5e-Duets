INTRODUCTION 


The Master of the Desert Nomads, whose 
name is spoken only in whispers, has 
returned from the dead to lead the nomad 
tribes of the Sind Desert to victory and plun 
der! 

Running The Adventure 

Red Arrow, Black Shield is a unique adven 
ture for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS(r) 
game system, in which the player characters 
lead diplomatic missions and armies against 
the Desert Nomads and their evil leader, The 
Master Unlike most D&D(r) adventures, Red 
Arrow f Black Shield uses two different sys 
tems for mass combat: the War Machine 
rules from the D&D(r) Companion Set 
(reprinted in part here) and the BATTLE- 
SYSTEM(tm) Fantasy Combat Supplement, 
which is needed in order to play. 

The adventure is played on three different 
levels: individual role-playing, BATTLE- 
SYSTEM(tm) tactical mass combat game, and 
War Machine strategic combat. The map and 
counters in this adventure are used for War 
Machine combat, but can be used in future 
campaign play to add new life to the D&D(r) 
campaign world. 

This adventure is designed to follow D&D(r) 
adventures X4, Master of the Desert 
Nomads and X5 f Temple of Death. Although 
it is desirable if the player characters in this 
adventure played those earlier adventures, it 


isn't necessary. If they did, they are already 
familiar with T he Master, Hosadus, a power 
ful and evil cleric. If not, they will learn all 
about him soon enough. 

You may place this adventure in your own 
campaign world rather than use The Conti 
nent from the D&D(r) Expert Set. The back of 
the large map is printed with a hex pattern. 
You can draw r your own campaign world onto 
that map (a scale of 1 hex = 24 miles will 
allow you to use the special War Machine 
movement rules in this adventure) and pre 
pare army counters for each of the realms in 
your world To prepare army counters for the 
realms of your campaign, you will need the 
D&D(r) Companion Set, which contains War 
Machine rules that are not reprinted here. 
You must define the alignment and objectives 
of each realm in your campaign world in 
order to play the diplomatic missions. And, 
you must create a desert realm where The 
Master and his allies live. 

Player Characters 

This adventure is designed for a party of 
4-8 characters of 1 Oth to 14th level of experi 
ence, and the range of character classes 
should be well balanced. The party will bene 
fit from having at least one magic- user of 
12 th or higher level, and at least one charac 
ter with a Charisma of 15 or better Each 
character should have two or three magic 


items appropriate to his or her level. An 
assortment of pre-generated characters is 
provided in tins adventure. 

This adventure provides a transition for 
Expert-level characters into the D&D(r) Com 
panion Set, which covers character levels 15- 
25.

THE INVASION OF AKESOLI 


This adventure begins in the town of Ake- 
soli, a main trading port and commercial city 
on the shores of Lake Amsorak. Akesoli is the 
focus of all trade with the mysterious lands to 
the west, including Hule, the Savage Coast 
(see X9 f The Savage Coast ), and other points 
west and south. Adventurers are not 
unknown here; many pass through Akesoli 
after adventures in the west, or in the Wild 
Lands to the south (see X6 , Quagmire), Ake 
soli is one of the most important cities of 
Darokin, thriving on all manner of business. 

The Chase Flow Chart 

The tow r n of Akesoli (and, in fact, all of the 
towns and cities visited in this adventure) 
uses a special mapping technique, called a 
Chase Flow Chart. You can use the Chase 
Flow Chart to represent an entire city with 
out having to construct a detailed map for it. 

The Chase Flow Chart is made up of cir 
cles that show typical street intersections and 
circles that show Hazard locations. A Hazard 
is an obstacle or event that affects play. The 
circles are connected by arrows. A number is 
printed next to each arrow; these numbers 
represent the number of feet between the cir 
cles. The letters inside each circle represent 
buildings, landmarks, or other events; they 
may change from city to city. 

Ten of the circles are numbered; these cir 
cles are starting places. Whenever a chase 
begins, or player characters are just walking 
through the streets, roll IdlO. Start in the cir 
cle that corresponds to the die roll. 

The Location Chart lists some of the build 
ings that may be found in each circle. If the 
player characters want to locate a building 
that you have not already defined, first decide 
if such a building exists, then either choose a 
location or roll Id 10 to determine a random 
location for it. Characters can ask passers-by 
for directions, look for signs, go into shops 
and ask around, or otherwise explore until 
they find what they're looking for. Once the 
PCs have located something, it becomes 
fixed; make a note on the Locations Table so 
that whenever the PCs return to that location 
they find it again. 

Only key shops and buildings are listed on 
the Locations Table. Residences are every 
where; the streets are clogged with people 
during the daytime. At night, parties of 4-8 
guards patrol the streets, and few'er citizens 
are out. If the PCs attack the city guards, 
they attract the attention of the entire neigh 
borhood. Within one turn, 20-80 reinforce 
ments arrive. If necessary, civilians help them 
track down the PCs. 

Some circles have the word "HAZARD 7 ' 


in them, and a "HAZARD" result is given 
for certain letters on the Location Chart. 
When the player characters wander into a 
Hazard Circle, roll for an encounter on the 
Hazard Table, given in this section.

Hazards 

When PCs wander into a Hazard Circle 
when they are simply exploring the tow r n and 
are not involved in a chase or crisis, roll ld4 
and apply the result from the following table. 

Hazard Table: Everyday Life 

I. An 8th level thief attempts to pick the 
pockets of someone in the party. If the 
attempt succeeds, the victim loses one 
item of value , but does not miss it immedi 
ately, Wait until the victim tries to pay for 
something, for example, and then tell him 
that he has no cash. If the attempt is 
detected, the thief runs for it. If the thief is 
caught and turned over to the constabu 
lary, the local officials pay a reward of 100 

2. Someone in an upper-story window care 


lessly empties a bucket of garbage into a 
curbside gutter, A big bucket of waste 
from a second-story window lands on one 
of the PCs, drenching him or her head to 
toe. The dumper quickly ducks out of 
sight. 

3 . A cart overloaded with chickens in cages is 
being pulled down the street, and sud 
denly overturns. Approximately 400 
chickens escape, flapping and squawking 
loudly Peasants run out of the houses to 
grab chickens (free dinner!), dogs bark 
furiously, feathers fly everywhere. The 
PCs are at the center of all this chaos. 

4. A wild dog (AC 7; HD 2 + 2; hp 10; MV 
180'{60'); #AT 1 bite; D 2-f2; Save FI; 
ML 8; AL N; XP 25) bites the ankle of 
one of the PCs. There is a 10% chance it is 
rabid. Rabies symptoms appear within 4 
hours, consisting of high fever and delir 
ium. If untreated, the disease kills w ithin 
48 hours. A cure disease spell will cure the 
rabies, but the victim is left weak 
(Strength and Constitution 1/2 normal) 
for 24 hours. After that period has passed, 
all abilities return to normal. 

Pursuit Situations 

If the PCs are fleeing or chasing someone, 
go back to the Chase Flow Chart. The dis 
tance between each circle is given in feet Use 
the encounter speed (feet per round) for PCs 
and their opponents. Running speed is 3 
times encounter speed. 

First, determine in which direction the 
pursuit is going. Then determine which side 
is faster. Calculate the difference in speed 
between the two groups. 

In each round of the chase, first figure out 
how far the party in the lead travels. Then use 
the difference in speed between the parties to 
find out if the chaser gains or loses ground in 
the chase. If the chaser catches up, run melee 
combat normally. 

Each time the party in the lead reaches a 
circle that has a branching intersection, the 
fleeing party escapes its pursuers if the dis 
tance between the destination circle and the 
previous circle is less than the distance 
between the two parties. 

The fleemg party may try to duck into a 
building or otherwise try to shake the pursu 
ers, The base chance to succeed is 5 % + 5 % 
for every 10 feet between the leader and the 
pursuers. Roll the dice secretly for this roll. If 
the roll fails, the pursuers have spotted the 
fleeing party entering the building.

THE INVASION OF AKESOLI 


Market Day in Akesoli 


The hot, dusty streets of Akesoli are 
jammed with people from all levels of 
humanity Hawkers of goods line the nar 
row, crooked streets, shouting out their 
pleas for buyers. 

The smells of city life are almost 
overwhelming-the stink of sweaty people 
and animals mixed with exotic spices from 
the strange lands to the west, the smell of 
the butcher shop mixed with the sweet 
odor of fresh bread hot from the baker's 
oven. Near the docks, the powerful odor 
of the huge fish market point the way to 
Lake Amsorak. 

The brushes you have had with death 
and the scars you carry seem to have given 
you an aura of mystery and power.,. peo 
ple who have jostled and pushed their way 
through the noisy crowds politely move 
out of your way A path through the 
crowds opens up before you as you walk, 
and closes behind you as the crowds crush 
in again. Vendors offer you a free taste of 
their wares and beg you to accept incredi 
ble bargains in their merchandise. 


This is a typical business day in Akesoli- 
hot, crowded, and always conducted at the 
top of the lungs. Most areas of the city are 
similar. The PCs can wander about as they 
like, checking out the city. Everyone they 
meet is far too busy to talk to them. If the PCs 
want food, drink, news, or just peace and 
quiet, they will have to find an inn. 

The Inn Crowd 

Several inns are shown on the Location 
Chart. Whether the PCs are actually looking 
for an inn, or merely for the things an inn can 
provide, they find the Next Door Inn. It 
doesn't matter in which circle on the Chase 
Flow Chart the inn is located . 


The inn provides welcome relief from the 
heat and clamor. The innkeeper, Zeb, a 
burly man with a huge mustache, greets 
you heartily, as does the barmaid, Tracy, 
an attractive and very friendly serving 
wench. Looking around, you spot the reg 
ular customers and quickly pick up their 
names and habits from the background 
conversation-Dugald, a bearded, bald 
ing man with an incredible tolerance for 
drink, Geoffrey, a sweaty carpenter, 
Harald, a magician's apprentice, and 
jon, an all-too-talkative scribe. 


The Inn exists as a place to start the adven 


ture and bring all the characters together. It is 
also a place where the PCs can find out where 
things are located in town or can hear rumors 
about the Desert Nomads, The PCs can learn 
that the nomads have been buying more 
horses and metal lately and haggled less than 
usual, travelers from the Sind Desert have 
been experiencing the worst weather in 
years, with particularly bad sandstorms, the 
nomads have been more arrogant and abu 
sive when they come in to trade, and some 
people fear attack by the nomads, but the 
general opinion is that the nomads pose no 
serious danger-they argue among them 
selves too much to threaten others. 

The PCs arrive in Akesoli several days 
before the Desert Nomads invade. They 
should have ample opportunity to buy any 
equipment or supplies they may be lacking, 
and to otherwise rest and recuperate from 
previous ad% r encures. Once the PCs are com 
pletely equipped and outfitted, and have 
explored the town to their heart's content, the 
adventure begins. 

The Invasion Begins 

Running With the Inn Crowd 

This event takes place one morning while 
the characters are having breakfast in the 
Next Door Inn. 


The kitchen door swings open with a clat 
ter. Zeb the Innkeeper and Tracy the Bar 
maid enter carrying steaming platters 
laden w ith hot breakfast food-mounds of 
scrambled eggs, rashers of bacon, loaves 
of fresh bread, and mugs of strong coffee. 
People begin grabbing at the food as soon 
as they place the trays on the table. 

"Don't grab," says Tracy, the dark- 
haired serving wench, in her musical 
voice, "There's plenty more in the kitchen 
when this is done!" 

You and your fellows happily stuff your 
selves in a long, leisurely breakfast. It is a 
pleasant change from the hardships of the 
adventuring life. And when you cannot 
find room for a single bite more, you relax 
with the fine cigars from Zeb's personal 
larder. It's going to be a lazy, sun 
drenched day,. 

In the distance, the din and roar of the 
town of Akesoli seems to be getting louder. 
A lot of people seem to be shouting in the 
streets. It's hard to make out their words, 
but it sounds like there's some sort of dis 
turbance going on. 


This is the beginning of the invasion. If the 
PCs don't immediately head out into the 


street, Geoffrey, the carpenter, bursts 
through the door, sweat pouring down his 
face, gasping for breath, "It's...an attack! 
The..,nomads...they're invading Akesoli!" 
he gasps. "We've.., got to get out of here!" 

When the PCs first go out into the street, 
they are confronted with an incredible sight. 


The sun has dimmed and reddened 
strangely. As you step out into the street, 
you are greeted with an incredible sight! 
Overhead, a swirling red morass, like an 
aerial whirlpool, has appeared out of 
nowhere to cover the city casting a sinis 
ter red pall over everything. 


This is a magical swirling sandstorm, a 
strange creation of The Master's mysterious 
powers. It begins at a height of 30 feet and 
stretches to 700 feet. If the PCs try to fly into 
the cloud, they are buffeted by howling winds 
and stinging sand (3 hp/round automatic 
damage, no spell-casting or missile fire possi 
ble, if flying device requires concentration, 
must save vs. Spells each round or lose 10-40 
feet of altitude) until they give up or reach the 
top of the storm. Above the storm waits 
another threat-The Master's airboats. 

Four airboats patrol above the cloud. The 
airboats resemble sea-going longboats, com 
plete with oars. Once the airboat com 
manders spot the flying PCs, they attack, 
always remaining above the storm unless 
they are destroyed. The airboats have a MV 
of 36", and can change direction up to 180 
degrees per Game Round. The airboats can 
travel at all three game altitudes (see BAT 
TLESYSTEM(tm) game case [15.1]) and can 
land on the desert sands. Missile fire from the 
airboats is made at no penalty. The hit dice of 
an airboat is equal to the sum of the hit dice of 
its occupants plus 30 HD for the airboat hull 
itself. A Wound on an airboat means that 
only one-half of the archers on board can con 
tinue to fire. An airboat that is destroyed (2 
Wounds or a Kill) crashes in flames, if the 
airboat lands on figures, those figures take 10 
HD of damage per individual. The airboats 
do not carry bombs. 

Akesoli In Torment 

One regular division of the Desert Nomad 
army, augumented by some special troops 
from The Master's private force, the Legion 
of Doom, has invaded Akesoli. You can set up 
the wargame map at this time, placing a Des 
ert Nomad division counter on the Akesoli 
hex, but it is not necessary to do so until the 
next chapter, in which the PCs become 
directly involved in running the forces of

THE INVASION OF AKESOLI 


Darokin and its allies. As stated in the Order 
of Battle section, the forces of the Desert 
Nomads get two free turns before the Daro 
kin forces can get organized enough to move. 
The Desert Nomads must invade Akesoli on 
Turn 1 . 

The Desert Nomad forces are running wild 
and unrestrained through the city of Akesoli, 
terrorizing the peasants, looting shops and 
homes, and wreaking havoc and destruction 
wherever they go. As the PCs encounter 
small raiding parties of Nomads, they can 
either flee or fight. Regardless of their choice, 
more Nomads continue to arrive according to 
the following table. Every 10 melee rounds 
after the invasion begins, roll ld6 and consult 
the following table.

6. No Encounter 

**W r hen moving in a crowded city, mounts 
move at half their normal speed. 

All encounters are cumulative, meaning 
that the forces opposing the PCs grows 
throughout this section. The reaction of all 
Desert Nomad invaders is immediately hos 
tile. If the PCs disguise themselves as peas 
ants, or use invisibility magic, they may be 
able to avoid combat (DM's discretion based 
on circumstances); otherwise, the invaders 
are particularly eager to attack anyone who 
looks like an armed fighter or spell caster. 
They chase the PCs if they flee the area. 

The Streets of Akesoli 

If the PCs head for a specific location, such 
as the town gate or the docks, check the Loca 
tions Chart to determine the location, or roll 
randomly to find the location if it is not listed 
on the chart. If the PCs are familiar with the 
area in which a chase is occurring, tell them 
at each intersection which way they should 
go. If they are not sure how to find the place 
they are looking for, have each of them them 
roll Jd20 against their Intelligence at each 
intersection. If the roll is equal to or less than 
their Intelligence, tell them the best route to 
take to reach their destination. 

If the PCs or the NPGs enter a HAZARD 
circle during the chase, roll ld6 and consult 


the following table. The PCs may be able to 

avoid some hazards by using magic. 

Hazard Table: Pursuit! 

1. Riot! Thousands of panicked citizens and 
invading troops have become embroiled 
in a huge, chaotic melee. Horses cannot 
enter the melee; persons on foot can move 
at the rate of 10' per round. There is a 
25% chance per round that pursuers w r ill 
lose sight of the PCs' party. 

2. Fire! Invaders have set a number of shops 
and houses on fire, and the blaze is 
quickly raging out of control. Smoke and 
random flame damage causes 1 -4 points of 
damage to everyone in the circle each 
round. There is a 50% chance that PCs 
lose their pursuers. 

3. Invaders! Roll three times on the Nomad 
Encounter Table and apply the results 
immediately. The invaders appear in front 
of the party, cutting off their advance. 

4. Roadblock! The peasants have blocked 
the way with wagons, cans, pieces of 
wood, and furniture. People on foot or on 
horseback cannot get through and must 
return the way they came. 

5. Juggernaut! A wood juggernaut (see the 
New Monsters section) is charging down 
the street directly at the PCs, as screaming 
refugees try frantically to get out of its 
path. Wood Juggernaut: AC 6; HD 25**;

THE INVASION OF AKESOLI 


The Invaders' Plan 

The Desert Nomad division is distributed 
through the town according to an attack pat 
tern. Use the Desert Nomad Standard Divi 
sion data on the inside cover of this booklet to 
determine what each company consists of. 

1. Town Gate: The town gate is guarded by 
one company of bugbear infantry and one 
company of hill giant skirmishers. If the PCs 
escape through the town gate, they find 
themselves pan of a long caravan of refugees. 
They can head around the lake to Akorros, go 
south and east to Darokin, go north and east 
to Corunglain, or go elsewhere. Their travel 
ing companions suggest that they should 
head to one of the major cities of Darokin, 
where something might be done about this 
menace. 

2. Streets of Akesoli: Two companies of 
goblin/dire wolf cavalry and one company of 
human regular cavalry are sweeping through 
the streets. They appear as shown on the 
Random Encounter Table. 

3. Docks: One company of human cavalry 
has attacked the dock area, trying to burn as 
many ships as possible. The docks are 
crowded with citizens trying to crowd into the 
various ships in the Akesoli harbor. The PCs 
can push through the crowd and get onto one 
of the last ships departing the doomed city, 
but the cavalry will try to obstruct any 
attempt to leave in this manner. If the PCs 
board a ship, it will take them to the city of 
Akorros, on the other side of Lake Amsorak, 

4. Command Post: The command post is just 
outside the town gates, occupied by the Divi 


sion Commander and Deputy Commander, 
two stone giants, two juggernauts, and all 
remaining forces. The nomads have set up a 
temporary wooden stockade where resisting 
citizens can be imprisoned. If the PCs are 
captured, they are herded into it. The com 
pound is simply a 100-foot-square area 
ringed with crude fencing and guarded by 
160 bugbears. There are 500 normal human 
peasants inside the compound. Since security 
is so lax, any reasonable escape plan will suc 
ceed, If the peasants are rallied into a mob 
unit to attack the guards, the remaining hill 
giants and trolls attack until the morale of the 
peasants are broken. If the PCs are captured 
a second time, they are condemned to death 
by the Nomads. AlIow r 24 hours from the sen 
tence of death until it is carried out, so that 
the PCs have a fair chance to escape. 

Rallying the Populace 

The PCs may try to rally the citizens into a 
defensive force to resist the invasion, Each 
member of the party can rally 10 x Charisma 
citizens, each 1st level. They act as a Mob in 
the BATTLESYSTEM(tm) game rules. If the 
PCs take this option, and build a fighting 
force, one company of City Watchmen (Reg 
ular unit, 200 1st level fighters armed with 
swords) joins them. It is difficult, but not 
impossible, for the PCs to defeat the invading 
force, since the individual units of the Nomad 
division are scattered throughout Akesoli. 

If the PCs defeat the Nomad Division, they 
are halted as great heroes by the peasantry, 
which they have certainly earned. However, 
other divisions of the Nomad army will attack 
until Akesoli is defeated. The players may 
move Darokin army counters to Akesoli to 
reinforce during the strategic game turns, if 


they desire. If the PCs remain in Akesoli, 
they can command divisions in a series of 
BATTLESYSTEM(tm) game battles. General 
Winter and Laran (mentioned in the next 
chapter) will arrive with the first reinforcing 
Darokin division, and the PCs will be offered 
the mission that continues this adventure.

THE REPUBLIC OF DAROKIN WANTS YOU! 


In this part of the adventure, the player 
characters have the opportunity to assume a 
leading role in a coalition effort to destroy 
The Master of the Desert Nomads. 

Leaving Akesoli 

Begin this section with the encounter that 
corresponds to the PCs 5 chosen method for 
leaving Akesoli. 

Escaping by Sea 


The docks are filled with screaming men, 
women, and children, desperate to crowd 
onto one of the cargo ships that fill the har 
bor. The sounds of fighting and destruc 
tion are everywhere as the Desert Nomads 
take control of the once-free city of Ake 
soli. 

Everywhere you see scenes of human 
tragedy- a woman passing her child for 
ward so that it will be sure of a place on the 
boat; an old man huddled against a ware 
house, giving up his chance for escape. 


Here is an opportunity for ybu to show off 
your skills as a storyteller. Emphasize the 
panic and misery caused by the cruel attack 
of The Master's forces. If the PCs take spe 
cific action to deal with the situation {reunit 
ing the woman and child, help the old man 
aboard, or otherwise using their skills and 
powers to save the citizens of Akesoli), they 
are spotted by a ship's officer, who offers 
them a place on the ship. He tells the PCs that 
their skills are needed to defend the ship and 
its passengers. If the PCs agree, read the fol 
lowing. 


As the crowded ship sets sail across the 
placid waters of Lake Amsorak, you can 
see smoke rise from the burning, con 
quered city. The evil sandstorm that her 
alded the attack still howls above Akesoli. 
Thousands of people are now homeless, 
and thousands more are captives of the 
strange invaders from the Sind Desert. 

The ship's captain says, "I never 
believed they'd attack, and I never 
thought they'd be this organized. Some 
one's got to be behind it all; those nomads 
didn't turn into a disciplined army all by 
themselves! It'll be a long time before any 
of us get back home." 


If the PCs behaved heroically during the 
escape, give them an award of 500 experience 
points each. 


Escaping Overland 

If the PCs escape Akesoli through the town 
gates, they will first need to defeat the opposi 
tion there. Review the information in the pre 
vious chapter on the gate and command post 
guards. The opposition the PCs must face 
depends upon their preparations. Unless 
they are killed, the PCs become refugees. If 
they do not travel to any of the other cities of 
Darokin, see the section "Avoiding the Mis 
sion," later in this chapter. 


Behind you, a large and growing cloud of 
smoke marks the once-free city of Akesoli. 
You can see hundreds of people who 
escaped the city-people now fleeing for 
their lives. Everywhere there are scenes of 
pain and suffering-an old man and 
woman struggling to push a rickety cart 
piled high with their worldly belongings, a 
woman screaming because she has 
become separated from her husband and 
children. 


If the PCs join the other refugees and try to 
alleviate some of their misery, award them 
500 experience points each. They can orga 
nize a mob unit of 100 refugees, if they wish. 

If your players are not familiar with the 
BATTLESYSTEM(tm) Rules, have an NPC 
suggest that the PCs organize and lead the 
refugees. The refugees will be attacked by a 
raiding party of 20-80 human and goblin cav 
alry. Use the BATTLESYSTEM(tm) rules to 
resolve such attacks. This minor attack will 
give your players a manageable introduction 
to the BATTLESYSTEM(tm) rules. 

The Heroes of Akesoli 


Your efforts on Akesoli's behalf have made 
you public heroes, and the celebrations 
are still going on. With the Mayor's letters 
of introduction in your possession, you 
leave the city, remembering the Mayor's 
words, "Let the fires that took our city 
kindle the bright flames of retribution in 
our hearts! Our hatred will not be extin 
guished until this evil is no more! Remem 
ber Akesoli! 


The Republic Readies For War 

In the normal course of events, the PCs 
end up in Akorros, Darokin, Comnglain. 
The trip takes one week. For the purposes of 
this adventure, all three cities are identical. 


Entering the City 


A town crier standing on a wooden plat 
form is shouting as you enter the city 
square. "Hear the latest news of the inva 
sion! Akesoli has fallen to the desert bar 
barians! All Darokin threatened! High 
Council institutes military conscription! 
AH able-bodied men at least thirteen years 
of age must report to local conscription 
office! Press gangs now operating in all 
major cities! Cash bounties paid for 
trained soldiers and officer candidates! 
High Council predicts victory for free 
forces of Darokin! 

The streets are swelled with refugees, 
many of them you recognize from the long 
journey. The inns are crowded beyond 
capacity; even the stables are rented out. 
Many people are camping in the streets, 
holding all their worldly possessions in a 
small cart or bundled in their arms. 


Because of the refugee situation, the inns 
are charging ten times the normal rate for 
accommodations and meals. Recruiting 
posters are everywhere. ("The High Council 
Wants You To Join The Legion!" "Join The 
Legion And Destroy The Desert Barbari 
ans!" "Death To The Invaders! The Legion 
Needs Men!") 

Treat this city as identical to Akesoli for the 
purposes of using the Chase Flow Chart. Use 
the Locations Table and Hazard Table 1 for 
the PCs' exploration of the city. 

Joining the Darokin Legions 

In several areas of the city (determine at 
random using the Chase Flow Chart) are 
recruiting offices. These consist of two tables 
in the middle of the street, with long lines of 
citizens trying to join and hopefully becom 
ing officers (for the bounty of 500 gp). When 
the PCs reach the front of the line, the 
recruiting officer recognizes them as well- 
known heroes (if they have adventured in 
that part of the world before, and especially if 
they previously completed X4 and X5). Even 
if the PCs are not natives to the area , the offi 
cer recognizes the style of the professional 
adventurer. He asks the PCs to go inside the 
house behind the tables and talk to the offi 
cers there. The officers inside ask them ques 
tions about their previous adventures and 
then talk to them about a special mission (see 
"Mission Plenipotentiary" below). If the 
PCs agree, they are enrolled as officers. If the 
PCs show a letter of introduction, go directly 
to "Mission Plenipotentiary."

THE REPUBLIC OF DAROKIN WANTS YOU! 


Press Gang! 

The PCs encounter a press gang roaming 
the city, forcing men into the army. Check for 
a press gang encounter each time the PCs 
enter a new circle on the Chase Flow Chart; 
the chance is 1 in 6. A press gang consists of 
20 5th level fighters (AC 4; HD 5; hp 25 each; 
#AT 1 sword; D L8; Save F5; ML 9; AL L; 
XP 150), They are escorting 6-36 prisoners 
(draftees) in chains, but are always willing to 
add a few more warm bodies. They challenge 
any able-bodied man they meet to volunteer 
to be drafted. 

If the PCs have already enlisted, they have 
warrants that show them to be officers in the 
Darokin Legions, and the press gang will not 
bother them further, 

Tf the PCs volunteer, the press gang escorts 
them to the nearest recruiting office, brings 
them to the head of the line, and watches 
them as they enlist. The recruiter spots them 
as powerful adventurers and urges them to 
accept the "Mission Plenipotentiary." 

If the PCs do not volunteer, the press gang 
attacks and tries to capture the PCs. If the 
PCs flee, run the encounter as a chase using 
the Chase Flow Chart, Because the press 
gang is escorting prisoners, their movement 
is half normal (move of 60' (30')). If the PCs 
fight back, run the encounter as a normal 
melee. Each turn (10 minutes), there is a 1 in 
4 chance that another press gang, attracted 
by the commotion, will arrive and join in the 
battle to capture the PCs. 

The PCs may decide to avoid the draft, not 
enlist, and avoid the war altogether. The 
town gate is always guarded by a press gang 
and an additional 40-160 1st level soldiers 
(AC 6; HD 1; hp 5 each; MV 120'(40'); #AT 
1 sword; D 1-8; Save Fl; ML 8; AL L; XP 
10) who stop anyone who appears to be an 
able-bodied potential draftee. The PCs can 
disguise themselves to slip out of town, or 
they can try to leave by sneaking (or levitat 
ing) over the town wall, etc. Of the various 
destination cities they might reach, only 
Akorros has docks. 

If the PCs become involved in a fight while 
trying to leave town, have someone recognize 
them and suggest that they might be inter 
ested in a special mission (see " Mission Plen 
ipotentiary"). If they escape without a fight 
and join the refugees, have someone recog 
nize them anyway, and suggest that it might 
be worth their while to talk to Darokin offi 
cials about a special mission. 


Mission Plenipotentiary 

At the local military district headquarters, 
the PCs learn about Darokin ! s mysterious 
special mission. 


You are escorted down a long hall to a set 
of double doors. Two pikemen stand 
guard, and snap to attention as you 
approach, "These are the people General 
Winter wanted to see," your military 
escort says. The guards open the doors for 
you to pass in. 

One high window slit casts a beam of 
thin light into the room. Large tallow can 
dles dripping with wax give the room a 
flickering, dim illumination. As your eyes 
adjust, you see a grizzled, gray-haired 
man wearing the insignia of a general in 
the Army of the Republic of Darokin, sit 
ting at a desk. His steely eyes give you a 
piercing examination as you walk across 
the stone floor to the hard wooden chairs 
in front of his desk. 

"Are these the ones?" the general asks, 
turning to a robed man standing beside 
him. The robed man pushes the cowl back 
from from his face and looks at you with 
his calm blue eyes, "Yes, I believe they 
are," he says. The robed man speaks with 
a Glantrian accent. 

"I am Laran, aide to Prince Jherek of 
Glantri " says the robed man. "1 am here 
to tell you of the part that you have in 
these great and terrible events " 

General Winter asks the party to be 
seated. "You are here at the urging of the 
Glantrians " he says without preliminary. 
"They have been predicting this invasion 
for several months, and their sorcery has 
found only one way to defeat the 
invaders- you," 

Laran continues, "The Master is in 
league with powers not of this world. We 
have learned that he has entered on the 
perilous path to immortality. The balance 
of forces is delicate. Glantri was not able 
to intervene directly, for fear of disturbing 
it too much. Our scryers and soothsayers 
have cast their spells, searching for the 
ones that could contend against him. The 
fates have chosen you." 


If the PCs have earlier completed X4 and 
X5, Laran tells them that their earlier success 
marks them as The Master's true opponents. 
If your PCs have not played X4 and X5, 
choose some notable adventure from your 
own campaign as the sign the Glantrians 
were seeking. 


"The Master's emissaries are traveling to 
the courts of the Continent to negotiate * 
with the various realms. He is telling the 
neighboring rulers that his only territorial 
ambition is Darokin, and that once he con 
quers Darokin he will live in peace forever 
with his neighbors. And although the other 
realms are suspicious, they are staying out 
of the w r ar, hoping that The Master will 
stop with Darokin and spare their coun 
tries. No one wants war. Of course, we 
know that The Master is without honor. 
His promises are worthless, but it is hard to 
convince others of that,. .others who do not 
possess our powers and insight." 

"Our magic tells us that a party of 
brave heroes might be able to break the 
thrall of The Master's emissaries, and 
bring nations into the battle for freedom. 
And there is a prophecy that the same 
band of heroes, aided by volunteers from 
Darokin and its allies, can defeat The 
Master in open combat. We do not know 
how this might be accomplished, but our 
magic tells us that it is so, nonetheless." 

General Winter leans forward, "It 
comes down to this. We need you," he 
grow r ls. "Will you do it?" 

If the PCs accept, the Republic of Darokin 
will appoint each of them an Ambassador 
Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary of the 
Republic, with full power to make and sign 
treaties, conduct negotiations, and otherwise 
represent the Republic for the duration of the 
war, and will give each of them the rank of 
Colonel in the Army of Darokin, A unit of 
Darokin troops will be at their disposal (see 
the list of PC units on the inside cover) for the 
duration. General Winter points out that the 
Republic is taking this unusual step only at 
the strong recommendation of the Glantr 
ians. He, himself, is suspicious, and would 
prefer to conduct the war by normal means. 
Laran and General Winter will both answer 
any questions they can, and offer any reason 
able assistance that the PCs request. 

If the PCs accept the mission and do not ask 
for a reward, the Republic will automatically 
give them each 50,000 gp and make their mili 
tary rank permanent if they win the war. Also, 
they earn a 10% bonus to experience for vol- 
un tee ring without expectation of reward. 

If they ask for a reward, the Republic starts 
with an offer of 20,000 gp apiece, and negoti 
ates to a limit of 60,000 gp. The PCs do not 
get the 10% experience bonus in this case, 
Laran suggests that the PCs begin their 
mission by traveling to Glantri, 


9 









THE REPUBLIC OF DAROKIN WANTS YOU! 



Avoiding the Mission 

If the PCs are offered the diplomatic mis 
sion and refuse it, Laran is deeply saddened 
and General Winter is contemptuous. He 
suggests that the cowards leave the Republic 
and never return. The PCs are allowed to 
leave town without obstruction, and can go 
wherever they like. 

If this happens, set up the battle map, and 
play out the war week by week as the PCs go 
on other adventures or continue their lives 
however they wish. Because the PCs do not 
work to convert the allies to the cause of 
Darokin (see next chapter for details), the 
Darokin Legions do not receive reinforce 
ments on a timely basis. The Master is likely 
to conquer Darokin, continuing his reign of 
terror. 

The Master is afraid of only one thing: 


high-level adventurers who might defeat him 
(he, loo, is aware of the Glantrian prophe 
cies). So, in each country that he conquers, 
he uses his powers to find and kill all 5th level 
or higher characters. He does this by sending 
out assassins (fighters, magic-users, chaotic 
clerics, and thieves). Whenever the PCs show r 
off their powers, bring large treasures into a 
town, or otherwise demonstrate their levels, 
trouble will follow. The fanatical dictatorship 
that The Master institutes in all conquered 
countries makes life very difficult for the PCs, 
They may end up getting killed, they may 
decide to flee the lands described in the 
D&D(r) Expert Set, or they may decide to try 
to fight The Master. To get back on track in 
the adventure, they vdlL have to visit Glantri 
City, where they will meet Laran once again. 
The war becomes a permanent pan of the 
background of your campaign world. PCs 


can emigrate to Norwold (see the D&D(r) 
Companion Set and adventure CMl, Test of 
the Warlords , travel to the Savage Coast or 
other uncivilized lands, or go south to the 
Island of Dread. Thyatis closes its borders to 
immigration; lerendi and the Minrothad 
Guilds likewise discourage new citizens 
(unless they are willing to pay a great deal of 
money). 

Tf the PCs decide to go after The Master 
without help, they will have a difficult time. 
Play the war out week by week while the PCs 
travel to Sayr Ulan or to the camp of the 
Legion of Doom. Use the information about 
The Master's camp and his forces to set up 
the situation when the PCs try to destroy the 
menace of The Master,

DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


In this chapter, the PCs embark upon a great 
quest to find allies for the beleaguered Republic 
of Darokin in the Second Nomad War. As the 
PCs travel to the great courts of the various 
countries in the D&D(r) Expert game world, the 
war continues to rage. The war is played out on 
the strategic wargame map. 

It is up to the players how many of the 
countries of the world they visit. Although 
the PCs are capable of swaying countries to 
their side, each nation has its own objectives, 
and some will become allies and some ene 
mies whether or not the PCs visit. 

Following the section that describes the 
individual countries is a series of events and 
encounters that you may place as desired. 
These are optional except for the encounters 
leading to the discovery of the Crystal Dagger 
of Cymvrrak' Of course, you should feel free 
to add in subplots, encounters, events, or side 
adventures as desired. 

Conducting Diplomacy 

When the war begins, only the Desert 
Nomads and the Republic of Darokin are 
involved in the conflict. All other countries 
are neutral, although most have sympathy 
for one side or the other. During the course of 
the war, some countries will enter on the side 
of the Nomads, some on the side of Darokin, 
and some will remain neutral. 

As DM, you must make the final decision 
on how each nation will participate in the 
war. The following system can be used to 
quantify the circumstances that may affect 
the destiny of countries, but you can overrule 
the results in order to balance the game or 
make the adventure more exciting for your 
players. 

Each realm has been assigned an Alliance 
Number. Countries with high Alliance Num 
bers are more sympathetic to Darokin; those 
w r ith low Alliance Numbers are more sympa 
thetic to the Nomads. The Alliance Number 
can be modified according to events and cir 
cumstances, such as invasion, diplomacy, alli 
ances of neighbors, etc. Some countries have 
unique factors Lhat can alter their Alliance 
Number; those factors are listed in the text 
where they occur. All countries are subject to 
the following Alliance Number modifiers. 

Alliance Modifiers Table 

+ 1 The PCs visit the nation to con 

duct diplomacy. 

+ 1 to +3 The PCs are persuasive and effec 
tive diplomats (DM'a judgment, 
but could include persuasive 
speeches, offers of military aid, 
etc. 


-1 to-3 The PCs are offensive, start a 
fight, or steal during their visit. 

+ 5 The Desert Nomads or their 

allies) have invaded the country, 
-5 Darokin or its allies have invaded 

the country. 

+ 2 If the PCs have previously adven 

tured in that nation and earned a 
good reputation (rescuing a prin 
cess, slaying monsters, etc.) 

-2 If the PCs have previously adven 

tured in that nation and earned a 
bad reputation (stealing, barroom 
brawling, killing civilians, etc.) 

Countries with a current Alliance Number 
of 4 or less become allies of the Desert 
Nomads; countries with a current Alliance 
Number of 11 or greater become allies of 
Darokin. All others are neutral. The current 
Alliance Number of a country can change 
throughout the adventure. Note that a coun 
try can change from allied to neutral, and in 
extreme cases might even switch from one 
side to the other. It is possible for a country to 
ally with the Nomads before the players real 
ize it might do so. 

If your players want to know how alliances 
are made, tell them that each country has its 
own Alliance Number, which can be changed 
by their actions or by the victories of the 
Nomad armies. Do not tell the players the 
current Alliance Number of the various 
countries or the number they must achieve to 
make an alliance. 

Influencing Rulers with Magic 

The PCs may attempt to influence events 
by using charm person on a king, or ESP to 
read a politician's mind, or use other magic 
as a substitute for diplomacy. Remember, 
however, that the civilizations of the D&D 
game world have lived with magic for a long 
time. If a simple charm person spell would 
work on a king, magic-users would long since 
have taken absolute control over the world. 
Rulers make sure that they are properly pro 
tected against that sort of magic. The method 
of protection varies from country to country: 
a special crown or badge of office might pro 
vide total immunity to hold, charm, and 
or instead might work as an amulet of protec 
tion against magic. 

If the PCs attempt any spell short of a 
properly-w r orded wish , simply tell them that 
it did not work. Do not explain why; let them 
guess why the spell failed. The PCs trick will 
almost certainly be detected. Apply the "-2 
bad reputation modifier" in this case; in 
addition, the offended ruler will refuse any 
other negotiations with the PCs, 


Recruiting Units 

When a country makes an alliance with 
Darokin or the Nomads, its forces become 
available for the war. In addition, certain 
countries provide "Allied Units" that the 
PCs can command personally The inside 
cover lists the armies available to each coun 
try. 

The PCs can get Allied Units even if they 
fail to make an alliance. If a country with an 
Allied Unit does not ally with Darokin but 
has a current Alliance Number of 10, there is 
a 50% chance Lhat it will give the PCs the 
Allied Unit. 

If the PCs travel with a unit, they use the 
unit's movement rate. Nations that are not 
allied with Darokin will not allow the units 
within 3 hexes of their capital cities. Nations 
allied with the Nomads treat the units as an 
enemy force, and consider themselves to be 
invaded if the units cross their boundaries. 

If the PCs decide not to travel with their 
units, allow them to establish a rendezvous 
city where they can join their units when the 
PCs have completed their diplomacy. 

The Realms of The Continent 

To attempt diplomacy, the PCs must travel 
to the capital city of that country. Move the 
Character Party counter on the game map 
during the normal battle turn sequence. 

Use the Chase Flow Chart to handle move 
ment and activity in the cities the PCs visit. 
In Location D, substitute "Royal Palace" (or 
other residence, as appropriate) for "May 
or's Palace," If the city does not border on a 
river, lake, or ocean, change Location Q to 
read "Warehouses, Glothmaker, Scribe, 
Moneylender," and in Location V change 
"Sailmaker" to "Furniture Maker." 

The Principalities of Glantri 

Glantri is a magocracy; the princes and 
princesses who rule the state are all high- 
level magic-users. They live in Glantri City 
most of the lime, though each ruler also has a 
castle hidden in some remote wilderness 
area. Actually, the rulers are more concerned 
with magical research than with ruling. Most 
decisions are left to the princely stewards and 
the various local councils of elders. The 
princes and princesses do not trust each other 
and live in a state of uneasy truce. In the face 
of invasion, however, they are quick to unite. 

Three Glantrian princes serve on the High 
Council of State, which meets to handle situ 
ations beyond the powers of the stewards and 
elders. When the PCs arrive, the Council 
consists of Prince J herek (chairman), Prince 
Jaggar, and Princess Carlotina. Laran, 


11 








DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


Prince Jherek S s steward, is secretary to the 
Council. All three council members are 18th 
level magic-users of high Intelligence and 
Charisma. The three represent the varying 
attitudes of the Giantrian rulers. 

Prince Jherek is a long-faced man with a 
hawk nose and piercing eyes. He is already 
sympathetic to the cause of Darokin and 
would like Glantri to take a more active role 
in the war. He is convinced that The Master 
is a menace who must be stopped immedi 
ately. His magical researches produced the 
prophecy that adventurers were the best hope 
of defeating the threat posed by The Master 

Prince Jaggar is thin and bald, with a 
wispy white beard and a grandfatherly man 
ner. He is a sharp and opinionated man who 
believes that magic-users are the only people 
worth respect. He is sure that The Master (a 
mere cleric) poses no direct threat to Glantri. 
Jaggar deigns to talk to any magic-user or elf 
PC, but no others. He wants Glantri to stay 
neutral and is unconcerned about Darokin's 
fate. 

Princess Carlotina appears to be a young, 
flirtatious, and empty-headed princess, but 
she is intelligent, wise, and powerful. 
Although she is sympathetic to Darokin, she 
believes that neutrality is the best course for 
Glantri. Like Jaggar, she believes that the 
mages of Glantri can handle any threat. 

Laran, who was introduced earlier, follows 
the lead of his prince in all matters. 

When the PCs arrive, set up the situation 
and introduce the Council. Tell the PCs that 
they must try to persuade the Council to vote 
for war w ith The Master. The PCs can influ 
ence the vote by helping J herek convince the 
others that Jherek's prophecy is valid, or by 
playing on Carlotina's sympathy for The 
Master's victims, or by performing a mission 
or quest for the Council (if the PCs are per 
suasive, the Council will agree that the quest 
can be performed after the war is over). Each 
quest is worth 1 to 3 points to the Alliance 
Number each, depending on difficulty. 

The PCs may also seek a private audience 
with Prince Jherek. Jherek can be a major 
source of aid and information for the PCs. He 
cannot tell the PCs exactly how they can 
defeat The Master (revealing this informa 
tion could invalidate the prophecy-the PCs 
must discover the secret on their own), but he 
can advise them on relations with other coun 
tries, or on any other matters that you, as 
DM, need to communicate to the players. 
Prince Jherek and Laran are both opportuni 
ties for the DM to pass needed information to 
the players, or to get them back on track if 
they get too confused. 

Regardless of whether Glantri allies with 


Darokin, Prince Jherek assigns the Glantri 
Allied Unit to the PCs for the duration of the 
war. He strongly urges them to ask the coun 
tries they visit to contribute units to build an 
army for the PCs to command. This, he says, 
is part of the prophecy-that only a force 
made of soldiers from many countries can 
face the Nomads on the field of battle.

Atruaghin Clans 

These grassy plateau, forest, and hilly 
regions are inhabited by herders, hunters, 
and fishermen who live in small villages. 
Their "capital city 11 is not actually a city, but 
a meeting area where, once a year, the clans 
gather for a great festival. 

The Atruaghin Clans ignore, insofar as 
possible, the events of the outside w r orld. 
They worship their own gods, keep their own 
customs, and are suspicious of strangers. AH 
the villagers claim to be descended from the 
ancient hero Atruaghin, If threatened by 
war, they unite temporarily under an elected 
leader. 

Place the Atruaghin counters randomly on 
the game map in the Atruaghin area. To try 
to win the clans over, the PCs must travel 
from one dan counter to another, spending 
valuable time in the process. 

Each clan is headed by a Chief, who is a 
retired fighter, frequently blind, lame, or 
injured. Think of an Indian chief who has 
spent his life fighting for his tribe on the great 
plains of the American west. The clan sha 
man (a 6-8th level cleric) is also powerful in 
the affairs of the clan. These leaders, 
although not schooled in the ways of civiliza 
tion, are intelligent and wise. They expect to 
be treated with respect, and expect the PCs to 
follow dan customs while present Use 
American Indian customs as a guide to han 
dling relations with the Atruaghin Clans. 

The dan chief will ask the PCs to prove 
their worth by having a fighter PC face the 
clan champion in single combat. If a fighter 


accepts, the two will fight using no magic 
except magical armor and weapons. The 
fight will continue until one champion sur 
renders or is killed (the clan champion will 
automatically surrender if reduced to 8 hit 
points or less). If any other PC interferes, the 
PCs forfeit the match (the other clanspeople 
will not interfere).

The Five Shires 

This is the homeland of the halflings. The 
halflings are sedentary modest people, who 
love peace and quiet and order in all things. 
The area is ruled by a council of five sheriffs; 
each controls a shire. 

The Five Shires have long been allied with 
Darokin. The two countries share a demo 
cratic tradition, and have many interests in 
common. The halflings fear the Nomads, and 
believe that should Darokin fall, they would 
be next. 

The five sheriffs (clan chiefs) form the 
Council of Sheriffs. Their names are Fosco, 
Saradas, Melilot, Holfast, and Madoc. They 
are all 8th level halflings. Four times a year, 
the sheriffs meet at a great feast and decide 
shire wide policy by a vote. 

The peace of the Five Shires has been 
recently broken by a series of terrifying inci 
dents. Ghostly creatures have appeared in 
the villages of the Shires each night during 
the last few weeks. Their touch drains the 
very life-force from their victims. Some vic- 


12 





DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


tims have disappeared, and come back as 
undead to haunt their neighbors. The Coun 
cil begs for the aid of the PCs. 

That night, at the stroke of midnight, the 
strange ghostly creatures appear in the half- 
ling capital. If the PCs are not already alert 
and standing guard, the unearthly noises and 
screams of halfling victims instantly awaken 
them, tf they investigate, the PCs see the 
transparent shapes of men and halflings; pur 
suing their madly-fleeing victims through the 
darkened streets. 

The ghostly creatures are spectres who 
have been sent by The Master to terrorize the 
halflings into submission. Only a few spectres 
were originally sent into the Five Shires, but 
they have slain a number of halflings who 
have, in turn, become spectres themselves. 
There are 12 spectres, 4 that were once 
humans and 8 that were once halflings. 

Spectres (12): AC 2; HD 6*'; hp 25 each;

Save F6; ML 11; AL C; XP 725 each 

Once half of the spectres are destroyed, the 
rest take to the air and head for their lair 
Because of their aerial movement rate, it is 
difficult for the PCs to follow them. If the 
spectres get 1,000 feet or more ahead of the 
pursuing PCs, they are lost to view, unless 
the PCs use magic to track them. If the PCs 
do not pursue, or if the spectres get away, the 
spectres return the next night, and each night 
until the PCs manage to find their lair. 

The lair of the spectres is a forgotten, dese 
crated temple ruin approximately 10 miles 
from the halfling capital, in a gnarley wood. 
The temple is a modified Grecian-style build 
ing, consisting of one large (100' * 100') 
room. Columns on the front of the building 
flank large iron double doors intricately 
carved with cabalistic symbols. In the day 
light, the spectres are dormant, but if 
attacked they wake up and fight without pen 
alty. At night, 1-10 spectres are flitting 
around outside the building, making it 
impossible to sneak up on the temple by nor 
mal methods. 

Inside the temple are 30 spectres, 6 of w hom 
were once human, the rest halfling. The spec 
tres fight to protect the temple, but will not 
pursue the PCs outside. A frontal attack by the 
PCs is obviously suicidal, but if they are care 
ful and smart they can win. Tactics with a good 
chance of success usually involve attacking in 
the daylight to gain surprise, active use of 
magical spells and items to wear down the 
opposition, "hit and run 1 * raids to kill a few 
spectres and then retreat, etc. 


The temple contains the following trea 
sure: 30,000 sp, 60,000 gp, 20 gems worth a 
total of 18,000 gp, a sword +J, +3 vs. 

undead, a scroll with a restore spell on it (this 
7th level clerical spell will restore one full 
level of energy (experience) to any victim 
who last lost a level because of Energy 
Drain), a scroll of protection from undead, a 
wand of magic detection, a hag of holding, a 
mirror of life trapping (nothing within), and 
a scarab of protection. Remember, it's best to 
let the PCs discover the properties of the 
magic items they acquire- don't just tell the 
players what their characters have found. 

One of the gems in this treasure hoard 
radiates magic very strongly. It is a piece of 
intricately-carved crystal in the shape of a 
dagger hilt. No methods available to the PCs 
short of a wish spell can reveal anything 
about the item. A wish spell reveals that this 
is a piece of the mysterious Crystal Dagger of 
Cymorrak , but w hat the Crystal Dagger does 
is unknown. The crystal hilt is worth 50,000 
gp by itself.

Grand Duchy of Karameikos 

The duchy is a wild and unsettled land 
claimed by Duke Stefan Karameikos the 
Third. In reality, little of Karameikos is 
under the duke's control. Large areas are 
overrun by monsters and hostile humanoids. 
The two main settled areas are the coast near 
the city of Specularum and the Black Eagle 
Barony on the Gulf of Hulag. Ships leave 
Specularum daily for lerendi and the Minro- 
thad Guilds; ships also travel daily between 
lerendi City and Minrothad City. The PCs 
can travel across water to these ports at their 
normal War Machine movement rate. 

Although Duke Stefan has had friendly 
relations with the Republic of Darokin, his 
internal political problems far outweigh for 
eign policy considerations. Baron Ludwig 
"Black Eagle'* von Hendriks, lord of the 
Black Eagle Barony, is an extremely cruel and 
unpopular man whose goal is to conquer the 
entire duchy and enslave its populace. 
Although the Black Eagle Barony is techni 
cally under the dominion of the Duke, the 
Baron runs his own lands without interfer 


ence, The central town in the barony, Fort 
Doom is a forbidding place with dungeons 
that are rumored to be Tilled with those who 
have displeased the Baron, 

The rivalry between the Duke and the 
Baron is of long standing. The agents of The 
Master have secretly been in touch with the 
Baron, and have promised to help him over 
throw the Duke and take control of Kara 
meikos, if he will in turn ally with The 
Master. The Baron was only too happy to 
agree, seeing a chance to finally destroy his 
hated cousin. 

If the PCs originally came from the Duchy 
of Karameikos (as provided in the D&D(r) 
Expert Set), then they should be well aware of 
the political and military situation in the 
duchy, except for the recent secret alliance 
between the Baron and The Master. PCs 
from Karameikos should know all the infor 
mation concerning the duchy in the Expert 
Rulebook. Their previous exploits might 
even include the original adventure in the 
D&D Basie Set, in which they confronted the 
evil magic-user Bargle, as well as adventures 
Bl f In Search of the Unknown , B2 1 The 
Keep on the Borderlands , B3 f Palace of the 
Silver Princess f B6, The Veiled Society (con 
taining much information about the city of 
Specularum), or BSOLO Lathan's Gold. 
The latter two adventures may have brought 
the PCs into contact with Duke Stefan or 
Baron Ludwig. If so, you should shape the 
encounters in this section based on what has 
happened previously in your campaign. It is 
possible, for example, that the PCs have 
earned a bad reputation in the Duchy, and 
may have powerful enemies-possibly even 
the Duke. If so, now is the time for the PCs' 
past to catch up with them; their earlier mis 
behavior could lead to a major setback! 

When the PCs arrive in Specularum, they 
are treated with the respect due their rank as 
Ambassadors Extraordinary and Plentipo- 
tentiary of the Republic of Darokin. It takes 
two days for them to get an audience with the 
Duke, because Baron Ludwig and his new 
"friends" the Nomad Ambassadors, have 
also demanded an audience. The Duke 
decides to hear both sides in a large council. 
The Audience Chamber is a large hall. The 
Duke, wearing costly robes and a crown, sits 
on a throne at the front of the room. Two 
guards with halberds flank the door Another 
20 guards can be summoned by the Duke in 
the unlikely event of trouble; the additional 
guards arrive in six rounds,

DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


As DM, you must play the roles of the 
Duke, the Baron, and the emissaries of The 
Master.

The Baron is an oily and repulsive man 
who dresses entirely in black; even his armor 
is. black. His arrogant sneer makes it clear he 
cannot be trusted. He is the archetypal vil 
lain, who graciously offers his victims fine 
brandy just before he lowers them in an alli 
gator pit. If goaded, von Hendricks is liable 
to suddenly scream and rage, and then, just 
as suddenly, return to his unctious self.

The Emissaries of The Master are robed

They will not fight or use magic while in the 
Duke's palace, except to defend themselves. 
With a slight hiss in their voices, they prom 
ise eternal peace and friendship and explain 
that Darokin is their only territorial demand. 
They hint gently that should the Duke not 
ally with The Master, he and his people will 
regret it.

The poison on each emissary's dagger is 
only sufficient to poison one victim. 

The Duke asks the PCs to present their 
case for alliance with Darokin, then allows 
the Baron and the Emissaries to present 
theirs. Role-play this encounter by primarily 


taking the part of the Baron and the Emis 
saries. The Duke listens neutrally to the cases 
of both sides. Then, playing the Duke, 
announce your decision. Consider the cur 
rent Alliance Number of Karameikos, how 
well the PCs presented their case, the long 
standing enmity between the Baron and the 
Duke, and what kind of reputation (if any) 
the PCs previously earned in Karameikos. If 
the current Alliance Number does not indi 
cate an alliance w r ith Darokin, the Duke 
announces that he is neutral in the Nomad 
War. The Duke will never ally with the 
Nomads, If Duke Stefan stays neutral, the 
Baron and the Emissaries take their leave 
politely, and return to plot further. If he 
declares for Darokin, the Baron throws a 
temper tantrum and threatens to destroy the 
Duke. In either case, once the Baron and the 
Emissaries have left, the Duke turns to the 
PCs and says: 


"It is as I feared. My cousin has joined 
forces with a powerful enemy, seeing at 
last his chance to take the throne. Come, 
gentlemen, we have much to discuss. 
Karameikos is about to be plunged into 
civil war, and I welcome all the allies I can 
get" 


The Duke tells the PCs that he cannot trust 
his generals because he does not know which 
ones have fallen under the sway of the Black 
Eagle Baron. Even if the Duke has already 
decided to ally with Darokin, he cannot pro 
vide military forces while there is a strong 
internal menace; he asks the PCs to lead a 
campaign against the Baron while he mobi 
lizes the rest of the army. If he is neutral, he 
offers to ally if the PCs help him defeat the 
Baron, 

If the PCs accept the mission, they are put 
in command of the 6th and 7 th Militia (all the 
Duke can mobilize on short notice) and the 
Duke's personal elite troop, the Elvenguard 
(480 2nd level elves wearing chainmail and 
carrying swords, able to cast magic missile 
x2). It takes 1 week for the Duke to mobilize 
these forces. If the PCs are accompanied by 
their personal forces, they can contribute 
these to the war effort. However, if they take 
casualties, you should record those casualties 
and deduct them from their troop strength 
later in the adventure. 

The Baron commands the 13th Militia (he 
has managed to place officers loyal to him in 
command) and also has the 21st and 22nd 
Divisions of the Desert Nomads (place those 
counters in the Fort Doom hex of the war- 
game map), which were shipped in by sea to 


support him. In addition, the Baron is 
accompanied by his personal Court Sorcerer,

Baron immediately allies Karameikos with 
the Nomads. 

If the PCs do not help the Duke, fight the 
Civil War on the strategic map using the War 
Machine rules. The PCs command the 
Duke's forces. The 6th Militia receives a +30 
bonus to BR because of the presence of the 
Elvenguard. If the Duke loses the war, the 
Elvenguard disbands and flees the country, so 
the benefit is lost. The 13th militia receives a 
+ 10 bonus to BR because of the presence of 
the Baron and Bargle. That bonus is lost if 
the Baron is defeated. 

Karameikos Alliance Number, Kara 
meikos has an alliance Number of 7 to start. 
In addition to the normal modifiers, the fol 


lowing modifiers apply. 

Karameikos Alliance Modifiers 

+ 1 Duke defeats Baron without PC help 
+ 1 Darokin is conquered by Nomads 
+ 1 Five Shires are conquered by Nomads 

Karameikos automatically allies with 
Darokin if the PCs help the Duke w r in the 
Karameikos Civil Wan 

Karameikos automatically allies with the 
Nomads if Baron von Hendricks wins the 
Karameikos Civil War. 

Kingdom of Ierendi 

Ierendi is a wealthy country, and tends to 


avoid involvement with the political and mili 
tary affairs of the mainland. Its wealth comes 
from trade and through sponsorship of 
adventuring parties. The PCs can easily tra 
vel between the mainland and Ierendi at the 
War Machine movement rate. 

The custom of Ierendi is to give the titles of 
King and Queen to the greatest adventurers 
of the Kingdom; however, they are without 
true power and serve only as figureheads. 
Actual rule is held by certain aristocratic fam 
ilies (making Ierendi an oligarchy). Ierendi 
rewards successful adventurers with titles of 
nobility and other honors. 

Because the PCs are noted adventurers, 
they are received in Ierendi with great honor. 
The welcomers strew' garlands on the gang-

plank before them, and a golden chariot is 
sent to bring them to the Royal Palace. 

The Royal Palace of lerendi is a magnifi 
cent edifice made entirely out of gleaming 
coral, edged in gold and adorned with some 
of the most beautiful sculpture, stained glass, 
and other fine art that the wealth of lerendi 
could buy. 

The current monarchs of lerendi are the 
elderly King Strongheart(tm) and Queen Mer- 
cion(tm) , whose quest for the fabled Heamtone 
is legendary. Their court consists of other 
famous adventurers, their companions dur 
ing many years of questing, including the 
dwarf Elkhorn(tm), and wizard Ringleron(tm), the 
elf Peralay(tm), and the halfling Figgen(tm), all of 
whom are now in retirement. These charac 
ters are based on the ADVANCED 
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS(tm) Action Toy 
Figures previously produced by LJN Toys, 
Ltd,, and on the official ADVANCED 
DUNGEONS & DRAGONS(tm) Fantasy 
Adventure Figures produced by TSR, Inc, 
They are featured in XL1, Quest for the 
Heartstone and AC1 , Shady Dragon Inn. No 
statistics for these characters are given here, 
since they are not involved in any of the 
action. Refer to XL1 and AC1 for more 
details. If you decide to use them in this 
adventure or in future adventures in lerendi, 
they all reached Companion level and retired 
by the time King Strongheart and Queen 
Merc ion ascended the throne. 

The PCs can easily get an audience with 
King Strongheart and his court. The king is 
proud of his knowledge of great adventurers 
and their exploits, and as the PCs are intro 
duced, he remarks on some notable deed each 
has done. Unfortunately, this reminds him or 
his own adventurers, about which he can talk 
endlessly No sooner do the PCs begin to 
speak of the war in the north than King 
Strongheart interrupts to talk about his glory 
days as an adventurer, "Why, I used to be 
able to w hip three evil clerics in a day, and not 
even work up a sweat!" he boasts, and then 
launches into a long, boring, and pointless 
story. Queen Mercion is no help; she is 
wrapped up in her knitting and looks up occa 
sionally to say, " Yes, dear," as the king drones 
on. His companions are equally boastful and 
long-winded, and talking to them just com 
pounds the problem. To handle this, you 
should make King Strongheart's boasting as 
tedious and exaggerated as you can. 

There is a formal banquet hosted by the 
King that evening, in which all the adventur 
ers (including the PCs) get a chance to boast. 

The next morning, the Council of Lords, 
the actual ruling body of the island kingdom, 
request a private meeting with the PCs, 


Lords Meikros, Karibus, and Seilus cur 
rently make up the council. They are elderly, 
bearded men who do not flaunt their author 
ity in public. Lord Seilus greets the PCs cor 
dially, then gets abruptly down to business. 


"We have watched the war's progress with 
concern, and we sympathize with our 
neighbors in their plight. An alliance, 
however, is not so simple. lerendi must 
first have proof of the valor of its allies." 

"On one of the outlying islands " Lord 
Meikros says, "a roc has bullt a nest. This 
horrid creature is a menace to shipping, 
because it favors canvas and rigging to 
build its nest. We sent soldiers to destroy 
its nest and scare it away, but the roc 
swooped down and carried off the com 
mander, and the soldiers all ran away. We 
do not know if the commander is alive or 
dead. But I must know the truth, for he is 
my son Midges, Find him, or bring his 
remains back for proper burial, and we 
shall support your cause" 


Roc's Roost 


The Council provides a ship to take you to 
the Roc's Island, a small crag jutting out 
of the sea. In the mist, they can see the 
cone of an ancient, dormant volcano. 
From this peak comes a piercing shriek- 
the call of the roc! 

The giant roc, far larger than an ele 
phant, flies out from the mist surrounding 
the volcano and swoops down at the ship. 
Crewmen panic and dive overboard; 
screams and shouts fill the air. 


Roc, Giant (1); AC 0; HD 36; hp 160; MV 
60' (20 *); flying 480'(160'); #AT 2 claws/ 
1 bite; D 3-18/3-18/8-48; Save F36; ML 
10 (12 in lair); ALL; XP 6,250. 

The PCs have four rounds to act before the 
roc attacks. If the PCs cause more than 30 hp 
of damage to the roc, it shrieks and wheels 
off, heading for its lair. If the PCs pursue the 
roc, none of the sailors will land on the island. 
If necessary, the ship's captain will put the 
PCs ashore in a boat. 

The island is rocky, small, and bare. The 
dormant volcano is the only feature of interest. 
Vegetation is sparse, A steamy mist obscures 
vision past 40 feet. The volcano is easy to 
climb; it takes about 2 hours to reach the top 
unless magical transportation is used. There is 
a 25% chance each half hour of one of the fol 
lowing: 


Encounters Climbing The Volcano 

1. The roc w heels out of the mist and swoops 
to attack. If k takes 40 points of damage, it 
flees. Sec the Swoop rules in the D&D 
Expert Rulebook, page 45, on damage 
and grabbing opponents. The roc will fly 
to its nest with any victim it catches. 

2, Three flame salamanders (AC 2; HD 8;

N; XP 1,200) who live inside the volcano 
are enraged by the approaching PCs, The 
salamanders emerge from a crevasse and 
attack anyone climbing the volcano. 

3. The party sees a small cave. If the PCs 
investigate, they will be attacked by six 
rhagodessae (AC 5; HD 4 + 2; hp 24, 20, 
18, 18, 16, 14; MV 150'(50'); #AT 1 leg/ 
1 bite; D 0 + suckers/2-16; Save F2; ML 
9; AL N; XP 125) who have a nest within 
the cave. Within the cave is the corpse of 
an unwary adventurer. A ring of invisibil 
ity, a sword, a dagger, and a pouch with 
400 gp are on the body, 

4, The volcano sides become steep here, and 
climbers must use ropes and spikes to 
climb the next 200 feet. Each 50 feet, each 
PC must make a Dexterity check (roll 
ld20; if result is greater than that charac 
ter's Dexterity, the check fails). Failure 
means slipping down the volcano. If the 
PC is not roped and secured, he falls, suf 
fering 1 d6 damage per 10 feet fallen (max 
imum of 20d6 damage). If the PC is 
secured, he slips 10 feet and takes ld4 
damage from scrapes against the hard 
rock. Thieves can use their Climb Walls 
ability, checking every 50 feet, with identi 
cal results in case of failure. 

If the PCs fly up to the top of the volcano, 
the roc sees them and attacks unless the PCs 
are invisible. 

When the PCs reach the lip of the volcano, 
they see the roc's nest looming through the 
mist. The roc is there with her brood, 

Rocs, Small (4): AC 4; HD 6; hp 25 each;

The giant roc's senses are acute. Unless the 
party is using extraordinary or magical 
means of concealment, the roc sees them and 
attacks ferociously to protect her brood. The 
smaller rocs aid her in the battle. 


The battle has barely been joined in ear 
nest when you hear soft, moaning voices 


16 










DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


far off in the mist. As the flight continues, 
the unseen voices become louder and 
more piteous. 


If the PCs seek out the eerie voices, a hun 
dred yards away they find seven battered and 
frightened humans who had been captured 
by the roc. Six are sailors snatched from vari 
ous ships; the seventh is Midges, Lord Mei- 
kros 1 son. All are weak and in no condition to 
fight; when they heard fighting, they began 
shouting to get the PCs attention. The nest 
contains 4,000 gp, random gems and pieces 
of jewelry worth 7,000 gp, and a wand of 
magic detection. 

If the PCs return with the captives, King 
Strongheart declares a day of celebration. 
The Council of Lords ensures that all Ierendi 
hears news of the heroic deeds; the friendship 
of Darokin and its allies becomes common 
talk in the capital. At the end of a long day of 
boring speeches, the PCs are treated to 
another banquet, where King Strongheart 
gives each of them a jewel-encrusted ceremo 
nial weapon appropriate to each character's 
class. Each weapon is worth 500 gp. 

IERENDFS ALLIANCE NUMBER. 
Ierendi's starting Alliance Number is 6. In 
addition to the normal Alliance Modifiers, 
the following alliance Modifiers apply. 

Ierendi Alliance Modifiers 

+ 1 For each of the following countries that 
allies with Darokin; the Minrothad 
Guilds, Karameikos, the Five Shires 
-1 For each of the following countries that 
allies with the Nomads: the Minrothad 
Guilds, Karameikos, the Five Shires 
+ 3 Rescuing Lord Meikros' son 

Minrothad Guilds 

The isle of Minrothad is divided into many 
small baronies. The baronies form trading 
guilds, each with its own plot of land. The 
government is run by the heads of the various 
trading guilds. The political arguments and 
dissention in the government is often vicious. 
The city of Minrothad is a neutral territory 
where guilds can meet and trade. 

Minrothad is closely allied with Thy at is, 
but recent rumors suggest that all is not well 
between them (see X7, War Rafts of Kron). 
There is some truth to this. The alliance with 
Thyatis is seen as a practical necessity, 
because the huge Thyatis empire could easily 
crush the guilds, Minrothad is careful to 
ensure that its policies are acceptable to Thy 
atis and in the best interests of its larger 
neighbor. 


The PCs can arrange a meeting with the 
Guild's Council to discuss a potential alli 
ance. The Council is made up of 40 of the 
most powerful guild leaders and barons. It is 
torn with angry arguments, exchanges of 
insults, and general unruliness. When the 
PCs begin to speak about the menace of The 
Master, a fat, loud-voiced baron interrupts to 
accuse several colleagues of being traitorous 
stooges of The Master and trying to weaken 
Minrothad's defenses. This is enough to get 
the whole Council arguing, as the members 
accuse each other of responsibility for every 
disaster of the last ten years. The PCs are for 
gotten in the uproar. 

If the PCs have had prior dealings in 
Minrothad, or if they ask around about the 
Council, they discover that the only way to 
get things done here is through bribery. The 
rival guild leaders and petty trading barons 
all welcome bribes, as long as the amount is 
5,000 gp or higher. Any less is construed as 
an insult. If the PCs approach guild leaders 
and barons without offering bribes, the 
Minrothad leaders hint broadly that their 
favors are not free. 

Since the PCs are in Minrothad, you can 
take this opportunity to run XT, War Raffs of 
Kron or X8 Drums on Fire Mountain, both 
of which begin in the Minrothad Guilds. The 
PCs can impress the Council by successfully 
completing these adventures. 

Minrothad Alliance Number, Minrothad 
has a starting Alliance Number of 6. In addi 
tion to the normal Alliance Modifiers, the fol 
lowing apply, 

Minrothad Alliance Modifiers 

+ 1 For each 5 Council members bribed by 
the PCs 

+ 2 If the PCs complete adventure X7 
+ 2 If the PCs complete adventure X8 

Empire of Thyatis 

The city of Thyatis, capital of the empire, 
is an old, vast city built beside a large canal 
that separates the southern peninsula from 
the mainland, making the city a major trade 
center. In addition to the peninsula of Thy 
atis, the empire controls several large islands 
off the southern coast of the continent. The 
Thyatic culture is similar to that of the histor 
ical Byzantine Empire. 

The Empire of Thyatis is an autocracy. 
The emperor holds absolute power, but his 
decisions must allow for the desires of power 
ful nobles and for the threat of mob violence 
over unfavorable laws. 

Thincol the Brave is the current Emperor 
of Thyatis. He is a 36th level fighter who has 


been known on many occasions to be cruel 
and merciless. He docs, however, possess a 
keen soldier's mind. Like many previous 
emperors, Thincol regards trickery, deceit, 
and bribery as weapons to be used against an 
enemy whenever possible. 

As emissaries from a "minor" republic (as 
far as Thyatis is concerned), the PCs are kept 
waiting for one week (a full battle turn) in the 
city of Thyatis before they can get an audi 
ence with Emperor Thincol. They may bribe 
lower officials with a minimum of 5,000 gp in 
order to get an immediate audience with the 
emperor. 

Emperor Thincol is a shrew r d man and a 
hard bargainer. When role-playing negotia 
tions with this character, play the emperor as 
a tough, cunning man who expects to get his 
own way in everything. He is blunt and to the 
point in his speech. 

If the PCs fail to form an alliance with Thy 
atis, the emperor will sit out the Nomad War 
until one side or another is nearly defeated, 
then join the winning side to grab some terri 
tory. He is concerned about the Emirate of 
Ylarum to the north, feeling that it poses 
some danger. 

As detailed in CM1, Test of the Warlords 
(the first adventure for the D&D(r) Compan 
ion Set, which can be set immediately follow 
ing this one), Thyatis is struggling with the 
ancient empire of Alphatia for power in the 
newly-settled region of Norwold. The contin 
uing struggles with Alphatia occupy most of 
the military resources of Thyatis. 

If you plan to go on to adventure CMl, 
Test of the Warlords after completing this 
adventure, Emperor Thincol offers the fol 
lowing suggestion: 


"You need help, eh? And I need 
allies, ..friends, shall we say. ..that are 
sympathetic to me and not to Alphatia, 
Our friends to the east have laid claim to 
Norwold, the new lands to the north. 
They have even installed a puppet king, 
Ericall, to rule there. 1 have not consented 
to this, and I will have revenge. 

"Soon, King Ericall will offer domin 
ions to those who will accept his rule. If I 
help your cause, you must go to Norwold 
once the war has ended, and claim a 
dominion. Spy for me, and when the inev 
itable war breaks out, fight on my side. 

"That is the price for my cooperation." 


If the PCs accept this offer, when you go on 
to CMl, Emperor Thincol's agents will peri 
odically request information, and, in the final 
battle in that adventure, the emperor will 


17 












DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


expect the PCs to fight alongside Thy at is. If 
they do, they incur the permanent enmity of 
the Alphatians. If they double-cross Thincol, 
the emperor will neither forgive nor forget. 
Thyatis will send assassins, raiding forces, or 
possibly even an army against the PCs. This 
can become the focus for many exciting bat 
tles in your campaign. 

Thyatis' Alliance Number. The starting 
Alliance Number of Thyatis is 5. In addition 
to the usual Alliance Modifiers, the following 
apply 

Thyatis Alliance Modifiers 

+ 3 If Ylarum joins the Nomads 

-3 I f Ylaru in joins Darokin 

If you intend to play adventure CMl later, 
Thyatis will automatically ally with Darokin 
if the PCs agree to be Emperor ThineoPs 
agents in Norwold. 

Emirate of Ylarum 

Y la rum is located at the largest oasis in the 
Alasiyan desert, It is the center of caravan 
routes crossing from north to south and from 
east to west, and is controlled by the Emir of 
Ylarum and his royal family. The culture is 
similar to that of the Arabic desert states or 
the Central Asian city-states of Palmyra, 
Damascus, and Samarkand. Because the 
peoples and culture of Ylarum are so similar 
to that of the Desert Nomads, there is a basic 
sympathy between the two nations, unlike 
the usual Ylari hostility to outsiders. 

The current Emir of Ylarum is Ali Ben 
Faisal, a fat and rather stupid man who 
believes that those who live in the hot desert 
are tougher and more noble than those who 
live in the soft, effete civilized lands. Emir Ali 
Ben Faisal strongly favors The Master and is 
ready for war w r ith the infidels, but has no 
real sense of the potential cost of the conflict. 
He sees only the chance for glory and the 
opportunity to go down in Ylar history as 
Emir Ali Ben Faisal the Great. (If Ylarum 
loses the war, he w ill actually be remembered 
as Emir Ali Ben Faisal the Foolish.) 

Other members of his court, notably his 
Grand Vizier, Osman Ben Alyoob, would 
prefer keeping Ylarum neutral. Once the 
various sides have battered each other in a 
long war, perhaps Ylarum will be able to gain 
some additional territory. However, if the 
Nomads' victory seems certain, even the 
Grand Vizier will be in favor of joining the 
conflict. 

The Nomad Ambassadors are at the 
Emir's court when the PCs arrive. An alli 


ance with Ylarum is critical to The Master's 
plans. He needs the additional armies to split 
the eastern countries and completely isolate 
Darokin. Accordingly his emissaries will 
stop at nothing to keep the Emir on their side, 
and to discredit the Darokin ambassadors. 

The Emir permits the Master's ambassa 
dors to attend any audience the PCs arrange. 
The ambassadors ridicule the PCs and their 
proposals. 


"Show these lying dogs justice, great 
Emir! It is known to all that foul Darokin 
provoked The Master's wrath. The 
defeats of this wretched republic are a just 
punishment. The star of victory shines 
upon The Master and his invincible host. 
Those who join him bask in the light of his 
glory. The darkness of death will claim his 
enemies." 


On the day the PCs arrive in Ylarum, the 
Emir holds a feast in their honor. The Mas 
ter's ambassadors have prepared a surprise 
for them. They have secretly bribed the 
Emir's cooks to add a mild poison to the PCs' 
food. During the meal, each PC must make a 
successful saving throw vs. Poison to avoid 
becoming nauseated. If a PC is sick during 
the feast, the Emir is shocked by ihis insult to 
his hospitality and the nomad ambassadors 
are openly contemptuous of a PC w ho cannot 
hold his dinner. The poison has no other 
effects. 

Visitors in the Night 


The night of the feast, you are given an 
opulent bedchamber Silken sheets cover 
the beds, and priceless embroidered rugs 
spread across the floor. As the time for 
sleep approaches, you brood over the easy 
success of the nomad ambassadors. 


Unless the players specifically tell you that 
they are taking precautions for the night, 
assume that when the PCs go to bed no PC is 
wearing armor, and that their weapons and 
magic items (unless normally worn) are not 
instantly at hand. 

At midnight three Nomads using a ring of 
in visibility attempt to silently enter the room. 

Thieves (3): AC 2 (bracers of defense AC 2); 
T13; hp31, 28, 26; MV 12Q'(40'); #AT 1

AL C; OL 94%; RT8t%; PP 95%; MS 
86% ; CW 99 % ; HS 74%; HN 81 %; XP 
1,300 each. Each thief has a ring of invisi 


18 


bility and a scroll with a knock spell. The 
poison on each thief s dagger is only suffic 
ient to affect one victim. 

The thieves attempt to enter while invisi 
ble, using their skills and spells to open the 
door silently. They have two tasks: to secretly 
slip the Emir's royal medallion of office into 
the bundled clothes of one of the PCs (choose 
at random), and to steal any pieces of the 
Crystal Dagger of Cymorrak the PCs may 
have recovered. 

If all PCs are asleep, they may wake up if 
the thieves fail their Move Silently rolls; each 
PC can make a saving throw vs. Paralysis to 
try to wake up. Any PC who wakes can auto 
matically rouse the others; the PCs are con 
sidered surprised. 

If the PC s are on guard, or if the PCs wake 
up when the thieves sneak into the tent, the 
thieves use their invisibility to gain a surprise 
attack. When they are revealed, they hiss: 


"Where is the Crystal Dagger of Cymor- 
rak? Give it to us, or die like heathen 
dogs!" 


If no other PCs are awake, they awaken 
instantly when this occurs. 

At this point, the PCs may not know of the 
existence of the Crystal Dagger ; but they can 
not convince the thieves of this fact. They can 
bargain with the thieves, or attack. The 
thieves each have a poison-filled tooth; if they 
are in danger of being captured, they try to 
kill themselves by biting the tooth and releas 
ing the poison, then die. 

The thieves are unwilling to give the PCs 
any information, but they know the follow 
ing: 

1, The goal of the medal lion-theft was to 
plant the medallion in such a way as to 
suggest that the PCs stole it, thus discred 
iting them in the eyes of the Emir. 

2, The theft was planned by an agent of The 
Master in Ylarum. The agent contacted 
them; they do not know r his name or where 
he lives, 

3, The Crystal Dagger is dangerous to The 
Master, but they do not know why or how. 

4 The pieces of the Crystal Dagger are scat 
tered in treasure hoards in the civilized 
lands. The crystal hilt is in the Five Shires 
and the dagger blade is in Alfhcim, The 
location of the third piece the Soul Gem is 
unknown. They do not know how to 
assemble the pieces. 

If the PCs can prove to the Emir that this 


la 








DIPLOMATIC MISSIONS 


theft was committed by the Nomads, the 
Nomad Ambassadors are expelled from 
Ylarnm and forbidden to return, on pain of 
death. 

Ylarum Alliance Number. The starting 
Alliance Number of Ylarum is 5 . In addition 
to the usual Alliance Modifiers, the following 
modifiers apply: 

Ylarum Alliance Modifiers 

-1 For each of the following countries that 
allies with Darokin: Thyatis, Soderford, 
Alfheim, Karameikos 

-1 For each city conquered by the Nomads

bility for the theft 

Kingdom of Vestland, Kingdom of 
OstJand, and the Soderfjord jarldoms 

Each of these northeastern states is com 
posed of many petty "kingdoms" that arc 
loosely united under one ruler. In Vest I and 
and Ostland, the underchiefs are called 
"kings"; in Soderfjord, they are known as 
"jarls" (pronounced "yarls"). Although 
these three countries are all described in a 
single section, the PCs must visit each one 
separately to gain each as an ally. 

The people of these kingdoms value indi 
vidualism, physical strength, and prowess in 
combat above all else. They live by fishing 
and by occasional raids on nearby coastal vil 
lages. Besides being fierce warriors, these 
people are explorers without equal, ranging 
far and w ide in their wooden longships. Their 
culture resembles that of the Vikings. 

Two special encounters are provided for 
these three countries. They can be used in 
any order you desire. Successfully complet 
ing each encounter adds 1 to the Alliance 
Number of that country, in addition to any 
other modifiers given. For the third court, 
you can simply have the PCs present their 
case, or you can use one of the encounters in 
the next section of this chapter. 

The Trial of Combat 

When the PCs arrive at the court of the 
king (or jarl), the Nomad Ambassadors arc 
already there. The PCs present their case, 
then the Nomads (the DM) present theirs. 
The Emissaries of The Master wear bur 
nooses. They speak in quiet but menacing 
tones, and there is a slight hiss in their voices. 
They promise the eternal friendship of The 
Master to those who ally, and suggest that the 


gods of the desert will utterly destroy those

After listening to both sides, the king (or 
jarl), whose name is Gustav, makes his deci 
sion. Gustav is a grizzled, elderly man, the 
marks of many years of hard campaigning on 
him. He believes that the best way to find the 
truth is through the ancient custom of Trial 
by Combat. He invites the PCs to select one 
of their number, and the Nomads to select 
one of theirs, in a combat to the death. If the 
PCs agree, the king asks the Nomads to 
choose their champion, and to specify 
whether they wish to use magic in the battle. 
The Nomads select Al-Aharazed the 
Arcane, a mighty wizard, as their champion.

The arena for combat is a great open held 
outside the castle. Each participant may cast 
as many spells on himself as desired prior to 
the battle. Al-Aharazed casts all his defensive 
and protective spells on himself. To begin, 
Al-Aharazed tries his death spell If that fails, 
he starts by using his high-powered, poten 
tially fatal spells first. If he is about to be 
killed, he casts phantasmal force on himself 
and then casts invisibility to escape the field. 
By fleeing, he forfeits the trial. 

W r hen one of the combatants dies or flees, 
the battle is over. All the magical possessions 
of the loser go to the winner The friends of 
the loser may take the body, and raise it from 
the dead if desired. 

If the Nomads lose, they immediately pro 
test to the king, claiming that their opponents 
cheated. Unless the PCs actually did cheat 
(another PC interfering in the contest, for 
example), and the Nomads can prove it, this 
dishonorable behavior results in the rest of 
the Nomads being exiled from the kingdom. 
If the PCs cheat, and this can be proven, the 
PCs are exiled in disgrace and forbidden on 


pain of death to ever enter the country again. 
The banishment continues even after the end 
of this adventure. In addition, the Alliance 
Number of the kingdom drops by 2, 

Dueling Flagons 

The king (or jarl) of this country is named 
Olaf, He is a fat, jolly bearded man with a 
deep, booming laugh. When the PCs arrive, 
Olaf is throwing a huge banquet. The ball is 
filled w r ith long wooden tables, each occupied 
by laughing, drinking warriors. Serving 
wenches carrying huge platters of roasted 
boar meat wend their way through the 
crowds. Dogs roam the din floor, growling 
and gnawing on bones and scraps. Huge 
pitchers of mead are being emptied just as 
fast as the w r enches can fill them. 

It is difficult for the PCs to get a word in 
edgew ise when they meet King Olaf, because 
he thrusts a joint of meat and a pitcher of 
mead into their hands as soon as they enter 
the great hall. "Eat, drink, be merry!" he 
booms. If the PCs persist, they can tell him 
why they have come. Olaf laughs deeply, and 
says, "I shall grant no man's desires if he does 
not prove himself in my court. Ha raid! Come 
forward!" A large, beefy man with a huge 
bushy beard appears. 

"If you can out drink HaraldKing Olaf 
says, "then you will have proven yourselves 
worthy of our friendship." 

This drinking contest should be resolved 
with dice, not role-playing. You should add as 
much flavor to the following procedure as you 
can, in the tradition of the Norsemen. 
Remember Thor's attempts to drain the 
mead horn of the giants, and similar stories 
throughout history and mythology. 

The character with the strongest Constitu 
tion should represent the PCs in the drinking 
contest. Take the PC's Constitution score, 
add 3 if the character has been previously 
role-played as a heavy drinker, and add 2 
more if the character has been previously 
defined as fat. Harald has a modified Consti 
tution score of 19. 

A character can drink up to one-third of this 
modified Constitution score (rounded up) in 
flagons of mead with no effect. With the next 
drink, he becomes Slightly Intoxicated, For 
each additional drink, each character must roll 
the modified Constitution score or less on Id20 
(a 20 always fails). If a check fails, the charac 
ter becomes Moderately Intoxicated, and the 
modified Constitution score drops by 4. Keep 
checking for each drink. With the next failure, 
the character becomes Greatly Intoxicated, 
and the modified Constitution score drops by 
4 again. W r ith the next failure, the character 
becomes unconscious. The first character to

two hours to recover from each stage of intoxi 
cation, 

A character who wins a drinking contest 
becomes greatly respected at this court, A 
character who tries valiantly but still loses is 
the butt of jokes, but is still respected for his 
effort. Failure to accept the challenge is 
regarded as cowardly, and the PCs are con 
sidered not worthy of respect or attention.

Ethengar Khanate 

The Ethengar are nomadic herders of 
horses, cattle, and goats. They are divided 
into small family clans. The clans usually 
raid and quarrel with each other, but a pow 
erful leader (khan) occasionally emerges to 
unite the entire Ethengar people into a strong 
"nation " However, once a khan dies, there is 
rarely an heir strong enough to hold the 
Ethengar together. Their nation then breaks 
apart, and the family clans begin warring 
with each other once more. Their culture is 
similar to the horsemen of the central Asian 
steppes (Huns, Mongols, Magyars, Turks). 

The nomadic Ethengar are much more 
sympathetic to the Desert Nomads than to 
the effete civilized snobs of Darokin. The 
Nomads, seeking to exploit this, have put 
their support behind Chanai, a great warrior 
who seeks to become Khan of All the 
Ethengar,

Chanai has been sending messengers to 
invite the Ethengar to join him and to spread 
Ethengar rule throughout the continent. He 
is currently encamped in his "capital city" 
(actually a collection of grubby tents) with a 
personal guard of 240 3rd level Ethengar 
fighters. He is always accompanied by his

Chanai is a charismatic but foolhardy 
man. If the PCs approach him concerning an 
alliance with Darokin, he spits on the ground 
and begins to rail about how disgusting the 
civilized lands are, while scratching himself 
His Nomad advisors are always by his side, 
and they suggest strongly that he exile, 
imprison, or kill the emissaries of Darokin. 
This pushes Chanai a little too far, and he 
challenges any one of the PC fighters to a 
fight to determine how much respect their 
request should get. 

If the PCs should refuse, Chanai orders 
them out of his presence as cowards, then 
orders his bodyguard to hunt them down and 
kill them like animals. The PCs must fight all 
240 members of the bodyguard or flee across 
the border. 

A Royal Duel 

If the PCs agree to his terms, Chanai 
orders his bodyguard to form a large square, 
and fights whichever PC is chosen by the 
party. Neither may use magic other than 
weapons w f ith normal plusses to hit, or else 
forfeit the match as cheaters. The fight is to 
the death. 

If Chanai wins, he allows the PCs to take 
the body away, but keeps the PC champion's 
weapon as a trophy. 

If Chanai is about to lose, one of the 
Nomad clerics casts a hold person spell on his 
opponent to give Chanai a free blow. If the 
spell succeeds, and if the PCs accuse the 
Nomads of cheating, Chanai realizes the 
truth. Deeply shamed, Chanai orders the 
Nomads from his village, and treats the PCs 
royally from then on. 

If Chanai dies in the battle, the body 
guards become extremely silent. The leading 
bodyguard tells the PCs that they must leave, 
albeit with honor, so that they can bury Cha 
nai. If the PCs raise Chanai from the dead, 
there is great feasting and rejoicing.

Rockhome 

Rockhome is the homeland of the dwarves. 
It stretches throughout the northern Altan 
Iepe mountain range. The dwarves have 
built and maintained a road through the 
mountain for caravans. They charge toll 
from all who pass. 

The ruler of the dwarves, the High King 
Under the Mountain, is named Everest. 
King Everest is a curmudgeon w r ith a soft 
heart. He continually interrupts, he com 
plains every time he is asked to do anything 
(although he frequently ends up giving in), 
he is likely to focus on a single minor point 
and keep coming back to it no matter what 
the characters say, and he gestures wildly 
when he f s talking. 

Because of the pass that connects Darokin 
and the lands of the west and south with the 
three kingdoms of the north, Rockhome has 
long been friendly with Darokin. Frequent 
caravans pass through the mountains, and 
many dwarves have left Rockhome to adven 
ture in the broad lands beyond. (If any PC 
dwarves are already established as being 
from Rockhome, add 1 to the Alliance Num 
ber for each such dwarf. Dwarves not previ 
ously established as com mg from Rockhome 
are assumed to come from the dwarven towns 
in the Gruth Mountains that form the north 
ern border of Karameikos.) 

The PCs can quickly arrange an audience 
with King Everest, The dwarves take the 
opportunity to show them the wonders of the 
city. 


The dwarves proudly give you a tour of 
the capital, a huge dwarven city wending 
its way through the caverns beneath the 
mountain range. The capital is at least 50 
miles long. There are endless corridors, 
city blocks filled w F ith bustling dwarves, 
strange mechanical devices like nothing 
else in the world, and forges where hun 
dreds of dwarven engineers create truly 
amazing weapons and armor.

We don't want to leave our Darokinian 
friends to the mercy of those Nomad bar 
barians, but we have problems of our 
own, let me tell you! It's those pesky frost 
giants, and they're raiding every caravan 
that passes through these mountains. At 
this rate, well lose all our business. We've 
sent war parties against them, but those 
giants are wiping out anything we've got. 
Now, if a party of brave adventurers, 
armed to the teeth, with the latest intelli 
gence we've got, were to go after 
them.,,We'd be very grateful, I tell you. 
VERY grateful. You understand what 
I f m saying to you?" 


War With the Giants 

This battle uses the BATTLESYSTEM(tm) 
rules. King Everest offers to let the party 
command dwarven forces. If the PCs are 
accompanied by their personal troops, they 
may use them in this battle as well. However, 
any casualties the PCs' forces sustain that are 
not recoverable under case 16,1 are gone for 
ever, and cannot be replaced. 

King Everest gives the party temporary 
command of a maximum of 4 units of dwar 
ven infantry. For every 2 PC units, he offers 
one less dwarven unit.

ever, they know it will take the special 
abilities and talents of spell-using adventur 
ers to lead their troops to victory. The giants 
are camped in a box canyon surrounded by a 
50-foot sheer cliff, with sentries positioned at 
key points, making surprise all but impos 
sible. The giants are organized as follows:

The PCs and their forces enter from the 
south. Unless the entire force is invisible, the 
giant sentries spot them. The sentries sound 
the alarm, then hurl rocks at the advancing 
forces. The giants inside the camp release the 
dire wolves, then follow them into combat 
(giving the wolves a + 2 ML bonus per case 
4,2). If the Morale of the giants and/or 
wolves break, they move inside the box can 
yon and hurl rocks to prevent the armies from 
entering. If giants inside the box canyon 
rout, they flee up the stone stairs and off into 
the mountains. If all the giants rout, the 
wolves automatically rout as well, following 
their masters. 

The tents are littered with rubbish, 
gnawed bones (some suspiciously human 
oid), and rotting carcasses. Amid the rubbish 
is the loot the giants have raided from cara 
vans passing through the Allan Tepe Moun 
tains, including the following: 125,000 cp, 
34,000 sp, 16,500 ep, 40,000 gp, 10,000 pp, 
600 gems (average value 500 gp), 100 pieces 
of jewdry (average value 1,110 gp), a ring of 
human con fro/, a wand of cold with 20 
charges, an efreed bottle, a scarab of protec 
tion, a bone case with clerical scrolls of speak 
with the dead, curse serious wounds , dispel 
magic , commune, and raise dead, and a sec 
ond scroll case containing a letter. The letter 
is written in a language none of the PCs can 
read. If a comprehend language spell is used, 
the PCs can read the following: 


Alrcthus, First Servant of The Master, 
commands: 

"The Master has praised your success 
in disrupting trade in the north, and thus 
contributing to the isolation of Darokin. 
Continue to strike against all those who 
aid our enemies, and we shall deliver all

"Above all, watch for those w p ho seek the

back to Rockhome, King Everest is effusive in

Alfheim 

As the name implies, Alfheim is the home 
land of the elves. The elven king rules the 
great forest of Canolbarth. Because 
Canolbarth is tended by the elves, it is far 
larger than a natural forest in this area would 
normally be. The Republic of Darokin pays 
the elves to protect the caravan route through 
the forest to Selenica. 

When the PCs pass into the Canolbarth 
Forest, they are immediately challenged by a 
party of 10 3rd level elves armed with long 
bows. Any elves in the party, or any PCs w ith 
unusual senses or detection abilities, sense 
that there are over 30 elves in the forest 
around them, all with bows trained on the 
party The elves are extremely polite, and 
inquire as to the party's business. Once the 
PCs have identified themselves, the elven 
bowmen escort them to the tree-city in the 
heart of the forest, where the elven king and 
his court reign. 


The city of the elven king is incredibly 
strange and beautiful. Much of it is 
concealed-the city appears to be open for 
est. Tall, stately trees have spidery path 
ways hung between them. The elven 
construction seems never to use straight 
lines; the houses are formed from natural 
wood, with the innate shape of the wood 
reflected in the design of the house. When 
you enter, you find a spacious, light-Tilled 
chamber, with only natural things around 
you. 


One such chamber, more magnificent and 
more beautiful than the rest, is the court of

the elven king. King Doriath of Alfheim is a 
tall, slender elf. He appears to be a young 
man in his twenties except for his eyes, which 
are deep and wise, as if they have seen the 
entire history of the world. King Doriath is 
faced with a difficult situation. The elves are 
loath to get involved in a war among humans. 
Neutrality is a tempting thing, but the long 
relationship between Alfheim and Darokin is 
important too. Honor means much to the 
elves. Also, the elves are aware of the true 
nature of The Master, though they cannot 
divulge this to the party. They know he must 
be stopped. 


King Doriath says, with gracious dignity, 
"Honor, it seems, demands that we ally 
ourselves with you, yet it is asking much 
of the elves that they risk so much in this 
conflict. Therefore, we make this request 
of you: that you risk your lives for us. 
There is a great dragon in the forest. He 
has desecrated the burial mound of King 


Alevar and taken it as his lair. Bring us his 
head so that we can reconsecrate the 
tomb, and we shall consider coming to 
your aid." 


Because the Tomb of King Alevar is 
located in the densest part of the forest, the 
PCs cannot bring their troops. The elves 
transport the party to the tomb in an elven 
lightship , a flying longboat described in the 
D&D(r) Companion Rules Set. 

The Tomb of King Alevar 

The tomb is a huge burial mound sur 
rounded by tightly-packed trees. The mound 
has earthen walls, and slopes upward to a 
cone at the top. The dragon has torn a hole in 
the top to make a lair out of the burial cham 
ber in the center of the mound.

the walls. Corridors leave the antechamber 
left and right. 

2* Vault of Queen Cerin: A stone sarcoph 
agus is in the center of the room. If the PCs 
open the sarcophagus, they are stricken by a 
curse. Each PC who fails a saving throw vs. 
Spells loses 50% of his or her Dexterity and 
Strength. The loss is permanent until a 
remove curse is cast. A normal skeleton, 
dressed in rich burial clothes, is within the 
sarcophagus. There are stone treasure chests 
that once held the burial treasures of Queen 
Cerin, but they are open and empty. 

3. Vault of Ale cerin; Prince Alecerin, son 
of Alevar and Cerin, tragically died trying to 
rescue an elven princess from marauding 
ores. His sarcophagus is protected similarly 
to that of Queen Cerin. Alecerin's skeleton is 
within the sarcophagus. The stone treasure 
chests in this room are also open and empty.

The amber golems attack anyone who tries 
to enter the burial chamber through the doors

the time, out of fear of the dragon. As a 
result, the vampire's hit points are below r nor 
mal. The vampire will not bother the PCs if 
they intend to confront the dragon. Once 
they have been weakened, the vampire 
attacks. The vampire will allow the PCs to 
find its treasure, but w ill attack if they try to 
take it out of the mound.

8. and 9. Burial Chambers: Both of these 
chambers contain sarcophagi, but were never 
used. The vampire uses these sarcophagi as 
spare coffins. The secret door in 9 leads to the 
dragon's lair. 

10. Royal Vault: This is the burial cham 
ber of King Alevar, now desecrated and occu 
pied by Balefire, a large red d; agon. Balefire 
is sleeping on a pile of gold an^ gems in the 
center of this vast chamber. Each round that 
the PCs are in the mound, there is a 10% 
chance cumulative per round that the dragon 
wakes up. It automatically wakes up when 
attacked. 

This is a large red dragon, not a normal 
dragon from the D&D(r) Basic Rules Set, and 
as such is much more powerful than dragons 
the party may have confronted previously 
(although not as powerful as a huge dragon). 
Details on the special attack forms and 
powers of large red dragons are contained in 
the D&D(r) Companion Rules Set. If you do 
not have the set, use the normal attack forms 
for the dragon from the Basic Set. 

The dragon's bite causes 4-32 + 4 points of 
damage, its claws cause 1-10 + 1 points of 


damage each. The dragon's breath weapon 
causes as many points of damage as the 
dragon has current hit points, Despite the 
fact that it cannot talk or use spells, Balefire 
should be a major, possibly deadly, opponent 
for the party. Review all rules relating to 
dragons in the Basic (and Companion) rules, 
to run this encounter with maximum impact.

pieces of jewelry (average value 750 gp); 
potions of dimunition and poison^ a scroll of 
protection from tmdeacf a sword +1,1 wish , 
a ring of spell turning, and a staff of power. 
This mound of treasure has been Balefire's 
bed. Underneath the heaps of coins and gems 
is a stone sarcophagus with the top torn off. 
The skeleton of King Alevar lies in state. The 
king is wearing plate mail +5 and a two- 
handed sword +5 is beside him. Clutched to 
his breast is a crystal blade that radiates magic. 
This, of course, is the blade of the Crystal 
Dagger of Cymorrak, one of the three pieces 
necessary 7 for this powerful artifact to work. 
Soon after the dragon is slain, the elves 
arrive in their lightship to transport the party 
back to the court of King Doriath Other 
elves will see to transporting the treasure 
back to the city and reconsecrating the tomb 
of King Alevar. Most of the treasure right 
fully belongs to the Kingdom of Alfheim, but 
the King awards the party 25 % of all treasure 
found plus all magic items except for the bur

SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS 


The following special encounters can be set 
anywhere (within the limits of the encounter) 
in the adventure you wish, or even omitted 
entirely, except for encounter 1, Quest For 
the Soul-Gem, that leads to finding the third 
part of the Crystal Dagger of Cymorrak. 

1. Quest for the Soul Gem 

The night after the PCs have recovered the 
dagger blade and hilt of the Crystal Dagger of 
Cymorrak, Laran, the mysterious robed aide 
to Prince Jherek of Glamri, appears suddenly 
in a cloud of smoke (a somewhat melodra 
matic version of a teleport spell) to talk with 
the PCs. 


"Congratulations, my friends. You've 
done well indeed. The alliances you made 
have greatly hampered The Master's mad 
campaign of conquest, but the tides of war 
are still against us. The Master's troops 
continue to pour out of the Sind Desert, 
burning and pillaging all that lies before 
them. 

"The wizards and sages of my home 
land have been working together to give 
aid and counsel in this crisis. It is difficult 
to predict future events involving men of 
great power and supernatural influence, 
so all the information that has been gained 
is covered in shadow. The Master has 
secret and powerful allies, and his ulti 
mate objective is hidden from us. 

"The two parts of the Crystal Dagger 
you recovered may be vital, for the Crys 
tal Dagger of Cymorrak is now the only 
item that can kill The Master. The third 
part, known as the Soul Gem of Light, 
gives the Dagger its special powers. With 
out the Soul Gem , the Dagger is useless, 
but the Soul Gem has fallen into the hands 
of The Master's agents, and even now is 
being transported back to him. The PCs 
must overtake The Master's agents and 
recover the Soul Gem , or all is for naught! 

"Here is where they are now." 


Place the counter labeled "The Master's 
Agents'' on the strategic map 5 hexes west of 
the current location of the PCs. The Master's 
Agents have an MV of 6, and are heading at 
top speed for Sayr Ulan. If they encounter 
any divisions of the Army of the Desert 
Nomads, they may enter the same hex as the 
division; then the division will turn and head 
for Sayr Ulan, 

If the party catches them on route, the PCs 
can choose to attack by day or night. During 
the day, The Master's Agents will be riding 


horseback along the road. At night, they will 
be in camp, but 50% of the accompanying 
troops will be awake, alert, and on guard. 
The rest of the camp will w ake 10 round after 
combat begins or the alarm is sounded. If 
The Master's Agents have joined a division 
of the Army of the Desert Nomads, the PCs 
can choose to attack at night, when the divi 
sion is in camp, or to bring in any friendly 
forces in range to have a BATTLESYS- 
TEM W game battle in the daytime. 

The Master's Agents consist of the follow 
ing: 

Commander (14th level Cleric); AC 0 (plate 
mail and shield + 2); hp 34; MV 
120'(40'); #AT 1 mace + 3 vs. spell- 
casters ; D 1-6 + 1 or +3; Save G14; ML 
10; AL C; XP 2,800. He is armed with a 
potion of human control , a scroll of protec 
tion from magic, and a staff of withering , 
Carries a purse with 1,000 pp and the Soul 
Gem of Light on his person at all times.

Level 2: blight, hold person , resist ft re,

Level 3: continual light, cause disease,

Level 4: cure serious wounds, dispel 
magic, poison, sticks to snakes 
Level 5: commune, insect plague, finger of 
death 

Level 6: speak with monsters, word of 
recall

If the PCs are accompanied by their own 
forces, run this as a BATTLESYSTEM(tm) 
game engagement. Otherwise, the party 
must cope with the cavalry as well as with the 
Commander and the Emissaries. It is possi 
ble to sneak in and eliminate the Commander 
without disturbing the troops, if the party is 
sufficiently clever. 


If the tide of battle goes sufficiently against 
the Commander, he will flee from the scene, 
carrying the Soul Gem. 

Once the Soul Gem is recovered, the Crys 
tal Dagger of Cymorrak can be assembled. 
The PCs need only touch the dagger to the 
hilt, and touch the Soul Gem to the indenta 
tion in the hilt, and the Crystal Dagger forms 
into a seamless whole. 

The Dagger is carved from a huge dia 
mond. It glows with a soft, white light, and 
obviously radiates magic. It has no bonuses 
to hit, there are no command words, and it 
conveys no protection to its wielder. It is 
strongly good-aligned. If the assembled Dag 
ger is touched by anyone evil, that person 
immediately suffers 5d20 points of damage. 

Laran cannot give the party any informa 
tion on how the Dagger is to be used without 
disturbing the delicate balance between the 
immortal powers. The PCs must discover the 
secret of its operation by trial and error. 

2. The Scourge of War 

This encounter takes place whenever the 
PCs pass through an area where The Mas 
ter's forces have gone. 


Black smoke rises from the ruins of a peas 
ant hut, and the scent of death is on the 
wind. The cruel hordes of the desert have 
scourged the countryside for forage. You 
hear a scream nearby. 


Stragglers from the Nomad army are ter 
rorizing a peasant family, refusing to believe 
that they are not hoarding food or valuables. 
The family consists of five 0 level humans. 
There are 20 Nomad soldiers. 

Nomad soldiers (20): AC 8; FI; hp 7; MV 
120'(40'); #AT 1 sword; D 1-8; Save FI; 
ML 7; ALC; XP 10 each 

When the Nomad soldiers realize that the 
party is well-armed and powerful, they hold 
the family hostage, threatening to kill them. 
The Nomads are basically cowards, and flee 
once the tide is clearly against them. 

When the family is liberated, they are hos 
tile instead of grateful, fully expecting the 
party to take up where the Nomads left off. 
The father says, in anger and bitterness, "All 
you soldiers are the same. You bum, loot, 
and pillage, and we peasants do all the suffer 
ing. Go back where you came from, and 
leave us alone."

SPECIAL ENCOUNTERS 


3. Refugees 

This encounter may be re-used as many 
times as desired. 

Large parties of refugees, bedraggled peas 
ants carrying their remaining worldly posses 
sions in small wagons, are moving away from 
the inexorable advance of the Nomad army. 
They don't know any details of the war, 
except that rumors of major Darokin defeats 
are common. 

There are two kinds of refugee parties, with 
a 50% chance of each type. The first type are 
normal refugees. They ignore the party unless 
challenged, and will not fight, not even in self- 
defense. They have no money. 

The second type have turned into bandits, 
raiding the countryside as thoroughly as 
would soldiers. If the party is accompanied 
by troops, they act just like the first type of 
refugee. If the party is traveling without 
escort, the bandits surround the party and 
demand a ransom of 100 gp per person to 
allow them to pass safely. There are 100 ban 
dits, all 1st level fighters. If the party fights, 
treat the bandits as a mob using BATTLE- 
SYSTEM(tm) rules. The morale of the bandits 
is 7. If they fail a morale check, they flee, 
never to return. 


4* Their Master's Voice 

This encounter can take place at any court. 

Fearing the diplomatic successes of the 
party, The Master has sent agents to dispose 
of the potential threat. 

Ask the players what precautions (if any) 
they are taking at the royal courts. Do not 
allow characters to sleep in plate mail armor 
or take other unreasonable precautions. 
However, two or three characters sleeping in 
the same room with one at a time standing 
watch is perfectly legitimate. 

At midnight, a party of The Master's 
thieves sneak into the FGs 5 chambers to try to 
kill them. Allow one thief for each PC and 
major henchman.

5. Random Encounters 

Random encounters can occur at any point 
during this adventure. You can alter the fre 
quency if you choose, or omit them alto 
gether if the party is seriously weakened. 


Properly run, random encounters can add 
flavor and excitement to the game. 

Use the following tables to set up a random 
encounter Table 1 contains a list of all the ter 
rain types that the party might enter in the 
course of this adventure. Next to each terrain 
type is a column labeled "Check/' This 
shows how often you should check to see if a 
random encounter occurs. For example, "1/5 
hexes" means you should make a random 
encounter check for every 5 hexes the party 
enters on the strategic map. To make a ran 
dom encounter check, roll IdlG, If the result 
is a 1 or 2, a random encounter occurs. 

Next, look at the column marked 
"Range." Roll the die listed, and add the 
modifier (if any) beside it. Then look on 
Table 2 to find the random encounter that has 
the same number as the result.

THE WAR OF THE MASTER 


In this chapter, the PCs organize an army 
and seek out The Master, fight an epic battle 
with the Legion of Doom, enter the mysteri 
ous desert city of Sayr Ulan in search of The 
Master, and finally come face to face with 
The Master in a climactic fight to the finish, 

The Progress of the War 

As the PCs visited the various nations of 
the D&D(r) game world, the war raged around 
them. The forces of the Desert Nomads, 
numerically stronger in the western regions, 
should have conquered most of Darokin and 
made great inroads elsewhere. The likelihood 
of Ylarum joining the Nomads should be 
turning the tide of battle slowly against the 
forces of Darokin and its beleaguered allies. 

The various nations friendly to the PCs 
have contributed units with which the PCs 
can form an army. The PCs were asked to 
designate a city where the units could meet. 
Once the PCs finish their diplomatic mis 
sions, they can travel to that city to ready 
their army for war. If the city where the units 
were to meet has fallen to enemy forces, the 
units automatically retreat to the nearest free 
city. 

As the PCs travel overland to the rendez 
vous point, tell the players that as their char 
acters stop for the night at various inns, or 
meet refugees and travelers along the roads, 
(hat they hear rumors of how badly things are 
going for the forces of Darokin. If the PCs 
pass through any warzones, or within 5 hexes 
of an enemy unit, they see evidence of the 
war-burned-out houses and farms, refugees 
pulling carts piled high with belongings, dead 
soldiers spitted with arrows, stripped of 
armor, weapons, and anything else of value, 
buzzards circling overhead wherever a battle 
took place... Use your imagination to 
impress on the players the death and destruc 
tion caused by this war. 

Nomad War Plans 

While the PCs are undertaking their diplo 
matic mission, the w r ar continues. The fob 
lowing priorities establish The Master's plan 
for the conquest of the continent. 

1. Darokin must be the first country to fall. 
The republic will be attacked by the maxi 
mum number of armies, 

2. Establish an alliance with Ylarum, and 
bring their armies into the war, splitting 
the continent. 

3. Attack all allied nations possible from 
existing nomad territory, allowing the 
uncommitted to stay neutral. 

4. Keep AHheim and Rockhome out of the 


war. If they enter on the Allied side, con 
quer them as quickly as possible, 

5. Hit isolated countries where possible, to 

provent formation of an allied "block." 

Preparing for the Showdown 

Organizing the Allied Army 

When the PCs arrive at the rendezvous 
city, they find it in chaos. Daily, rumors 
arrive in the city telling of major military 
defeats (many of these rumors may be false, 
but they tend to spread anyway). Refugees 
from the areas hit by the war are collecting in 
the city, as well as soldiers from a number of 
armies (including the PCs 5 own). Shortages 
of food, accommodations, and supplies are 
by now ordinary. Prices run 2-5 times higher 
than normal. 

The unit commanders of the various forces 
now under the direct command of the PCs 
are waiting for the arrival of their new lead 
ers. The PCs can meet with the unit com 
manders immediately to begin planning the 
organization of their army. The players 
should prepare individual BATTLESYS- 
TEM(tm) game rosters for each unit and deter 
mine their force command structure. The 
players can choose any legal spells they wish 
for their spell-using troops. 

The PCs can assume personal command of 
the various units. However, if they are per 
sonally commanding forces in battle, they 
will find that they cannot run off to perform 
heroic deeds without placing their units out of 
command. The best way to avoid this prob 
lem is to give each player one or more units to 
command, but use NPC unit commanders 
instead of PCs, The PCs should have ranks as 
Division or Army Commanders, as Deputy 
Division Commanders (to perform an acting 
role in the event that someone gets killed or 
incapacitated), or simply as Heroes, This will 
give the PCs more freedom of action: as DM, 
suggest this to your players if they do not 
think of it themselves . 

A Visit From Laran 

The same night the PCs arrive in the ren 
dezvous city, Laran, the mysterious robed 
aide to Prince Jherek ofGIantri, appears sud 
denly in a cloud of smoke (a somewhat melo 
dramatic version of a teleport spell) to talk 
with the PCs. 


Suddenly, the sound of loud thunder 
booms, and a pillar of smoke rises from 
the ground. When it dissipates, you see 
the robed form of Laran of Glantri stand 
ing before you, 

"Greetings, brave adventurers," Laran 


begins. "I bring you news of great import 
on the course of the war" 


The players may choose to ask questions or 
interrupt Laran as he provides the following 
information. Ad lib as necessary to commu 
nicate the information given in the boxed 
copy below. 


"You have accomplished much in your 
quest for allies, but the tide of the war is 
still against us. The Master's troops still 
pour out of the wastes of the Sind Desert. 
Many cities have fallen. Now r you must go 
into the Sind Desert to confront and 
defeat The Master yourselves. The w r ay is 
hard and the opponent is powerful, but 
you are our only hope now. 

"There is more, however. A number of 
the most powerful wizards and sages in 
Glantri have entered the Tower of Dolo 
rous Wisdom to study portents and signs 
of the future, to give aid and counsel in 
this crisis. It is difficult to predict future 
events involving men of great power, so 
virtually all the knowledge that has been 
gained is covered in shadow. Worse, there 
is information that cannot be revealed to 
you without causing harm to your mis 
sion. Yet this information is critical to 
your success in this endeavor. 

"Although there is little I can tell you, I 
can reveal that The Master has powerful 
and secret allies, and that the motive for 
his conquests is far more horrible than you 
could possibly suppose. 

"From the 'lower of Dolorous Wisdom 
I have brought you a secret of great 
power-the secret of the Crystal Dagger 
of Cymorakk, With its tnysterous powers, 
you can defeat The Master utterly. You 
must use it properly, however, or its power 
is naught. 


If the PCs failed to get all the pieces of the 
Crystal Dagger or lost it before now, Jherek 
assembles the weapon, gives it to the PCs, 
then continues speaking. 


"I presume too far, but listen carefully 
and I shall tell you how it is to be used. 
Above all, do not,,." 


At this very moment, a beam of painfully 
white light appears, striking Laran alone. 
Laran glows white for a second, screams, and 
then crumbles to dust (a disintegrate spell). 
No spells possessed by the characters includ 
ing a wish* will restore Laran to life. No spells 


26 









THE WAR OF THE MASTER 


possessed by the characters, such as com- 
mune t will reveal how the Crystal Dagger of 
Cymorakk is to be used. 

The Crystal Dagger of Cymorakk is carved 
from a huge dagger. It glows with a soft w hite 
light, and obviously radiates magic. It has no 
bonuses to hit, there are no obvious com 
mand words, and it conveys no protection to 
its wielder. It is strongly good-aligned. If 
touched by anyone evil, the evil person 
immediately takes 5d20 points of damage. 
For the PCs, the weapon is as much a mys 
tery as ever. 

Tactics for the Legion of Doom 

While the players are preparing BATTLE- 
SYSTEM"" game rosters and command 
structures for their army, you must do the 
same for the Legion of Doom, The Master's 
personal elite guard. 

The battle between the PCs' forces and the 
Legion of Doom is a climactic scene in this 
adventure. Although it would be easy for you 
as DM to throw a number of Desert Nomad 
units against the PCs to catch them, alone 
and outnumbered, and crush them by vastly 
superior forces, don't do this. Move Desert 
Nomads out of the way, if necessary, and 
avoid directly fighting the PC forces until 
they get near the Legion of Doom counter. 
Keep the Legion of Doom counter in the Sind 
Desert. In game terms, the purpose of the 
Legion of Doom is to engage forces led by 
PCs. 

The Master has two primary objectives: 
recover the Crystal Dagger of Cymorakk and 
protect the Soul-Gem of Thanatos- the PCs 
have the first and threaten the second. If the 
PCs were responsible for defeating The Mas 
ter in X4 and X5, he has a reason for wanting 
to crush them personally. And, since The 
Master must make continual sacrifices of life 
to the SoukGem ofThanatos , he would pre 
fer to sacrifice high-level characters, w r hieh 
are more effective. All these reasons have an 
effect on Legion of Doom tactics. 

If the PCs pick fights with various Desert 
Nomad units on their w r av to confront the 
Legion of Doom, fight it out. Prepare RAT- 
TLESYSTEM(tm) game rosters for any units 
the PCs attack, set up terrain on the tabletop 
for the appropriate terrain conditions. The 
experience may serve all players well in the 
final battle. 

If the PCs take reinforcements (Glantr- 
ians, Darokinians, etc.) into battle besides 
their own personal force, move Desert 
Nomad forces to intercept all the units travel 
ing with the PCs' own force, so that the PCs 
have to confront the Legion of Doom alone. 

If the PCs have split up among several 


units, the Legion of Doom heads for the 
Allied unit that promises the greatest chal 
lenge, usually the one representing the larg 
est number of players, or the most warlike 
ones. 

The Legion of Doom tries to avoid battle 
with any force that does not represent PCs, 
Unless PC units offer a challenge, the Legion 
of Doom does not move more than one hex 
away from Sayr Ulan, If the PCs try to 
weaken the Legion of Doom by sending other 
units against it before they battle, the Legion 
of Doom retreats, taking minimum losses, 
then tries a preemptive strike against the 
PCs. 

Against the Legion of Doom! 

The composition of the Legion of Doom is 
shown on the inside front cover of this adven 
ture, You must prepare BATTLESYSTEM(tm) 
game rosters for the Legion. Try not to get the 
Legion of Doom involved in battles before 
the final engagement with the PCs. If the 
Legion has been in a fight, deduct any losses 
the Legion has suffered from all units equally 
(as much as possible). Do not deduct losses 
from Heroes or Commanders, 

The final battlefields should take place in a 
desert hex. The battlefield consists of sand. 
At your option, you can place one or more 
sand dunes (1 elevation high) on the battle 
field. Do not let one side or another have a 
terrain advantage The battle should be 
played out on a surface at least 4 feet * 8 feet; 
larger is better. If one side receives an "on the 
march" bonus when the tw r o forces move into 
the same hex, the force without the bonus sets 
up first; otherwise, both sides set up simulta 
neously. 

The diagram below shows one way the 
tabletop can be set up for this engagement. 

You will have to make special counters for 
the Warlords of the Air unit, 6" * 3" in size. 
If the PCs did not fly through the sandstorm 
at the attack on Akesoli and see the airboats, 
keep the airboat counters off the playing 
field, and do not let the players know that 
they exist. This is The Master's surprise 
force. If the PCs saw r the airboats at Akesoli, 
bring the airboat on whenever the situation 
seems proper. 

When both forces have set up, the battle 
begins. Unless circumstances show that one 
side or the other has gotten automatic first 
round of initiative, roll for initiative nor 
mally. 

On the first eligible phase. The Master, 
calling on the special powers granted him by 
the Immortals, casts an extra-powerful fear 
spell that affects all individuals and units in

the Allied Expeditionary Force. Each Hero, 
Commander, and Unit must make a saving 
throw r vs. Spells or flee. If a unit fails its sav 
ing throw, it routs. If a Unit Commander 
fails his saving throw and the unit makes its 
saving throw, the Commander flees and the 
unit goes out of command. The Master then 
orders his units forward at full speed to the 
attack. Remember, if a unit routs off the play 
ing field, it is removed from play. This fear 
spell can be used only once. 

As DM, run The Master's forces in the 
most effective way you know how, trying to 
defeat the PCs on the field of battle. 

The Master can summon the Warlords of 
the Air unit whenever the military situation is 
right. The airboats have a MV of 36", and 
can change direction up to 180 degrees per 
Game Round. The airboats can travel at all 
three game altitudes (see BATTLESYS 
TEM"" game case 15.1) and can land on the 
desert sands. Missile fire from the airboats is 
made at no penalty. The Hit Dice of an air 
boat is equal to the sum of the Hit Dice of its 
occupants plus 30 HD for the airboat hull

itself. A Wound on an airboat means that 
only one-half of the archers on board can con 
tinue to fire. An airboat that is destroyed (2 
Wounds or a Kill) crashes in flames. If the 
airboat lands on figures, those figures take 10 
HD of damage per individual. The airboats 
do not carry bombs. 

Alrethus will probably be the Legion of 
Doom commander in this battle. If the PCs 
have the Crystal Dagger, The Master 
remains in Sayr Ulan to guard the Soul- 
Gem . If the Legion of Doom faces utter disas 
ter, The Master will intervene, conserving his 
spells and abilities as much as possible. If the 
Legion of Doom is defeated, The Master uses 
a word of recall spell to return to Sayr Ulan. 

If the PCs are defeated in this battle. The 
Master and his allies do everything in their 
power to capture or kill the PCs, If the PCs 
are killed, The Master casts raise dead fully 
to have them alive- all the better to sacrifice 
them to the Soul-Gem of Thanatos. 

Aftermath of the Battle 

If the PCs win the battle, the remnants of 
the Legion of Doom rout off the field, never 
to be seen again. The Master uses his word of 
recall spell to escape, leaving his minions 
behind. The PCs must pursue him into the 
city of Sayr Ulan. If they don't know which 
way to go, the Crystal Dagger of Cymorakk 
begins to glow. The person carrying the dag 
ger feels a mystic force tugging him-if he 
follows the feeling, it will lead him to The 
Master, 

The officers of the Allied Expeditionary 
Force advise the PCs after the battle that the 
PCs must go on alone-the A.E.F. is not 
powerful enough to invade Sayr Ulan, Only 
stealth and bravery on the part of the PCs can 
carry the day. The A.E,F. will wait on the bat 
tlefield for 24 hours, then head for safety. 

If the PCs lose the battle, they may be cap 
tured or killed. If so, they are raised, if neces 
sary, and taken to The Master's residence in 
Sayr Ulan, If the PCs escape into the desert, 
a huge sandstorm like the one that hit Akesoli 
springs up, overpowering them and causing 
them to lose their direction. When the sand 
storm (another of The Master's nasty sur 
prises) dissipates, they find themselves at the 
outskirts of Sayr Ulan, separated from their 
forces, with the glowing Crystal Dagger urg 
ing them to enter. 

The City of Sayr Ulan 

Sayr Ulan is an immense tent city with sev 
eral hundred thousand inhabitants, both 
Desert Nomads and citizens of the land of 
Hule (see X5, Temple of Death for details of 


Hule). The city sprang up virtually over 
night, with people pitching tents and build 
ing crude, makeshift homes wherever they 
could And an unoccupied piece of land. 
There are no streets as such, just narrow 
lanes between houses. The unplanned nature 
of the city is its most distinguishing character 
istic, Reeking animal pens are next to tents 
inhabited by people; there are no stores, only 
merchants hawking their wares from carts. 
Water is the most common commodity being 
sold. Huge campfires burn day and night, 
providing fires for cooking in the day and 
illumination at night. The city is incredibly 
filthy; there is no sanitation system. Offal and 
waste litter the streets; the smell of camels, a 
particularly pungent odor, is everywhere, 

Sayr Ulan is built in three rings: the Outer 
City, inhabited exclusively by peasants and 
soldiers, the Inner City, inhabited by mer 
chants, higher-ran king soldiers, and the less- 
destitute peasantry, and in the center of the 
city, the Camp of The Master, 

Chase Flow Charts are included for the 
Inner and Outer City 

Outside the Outer City are smaller camps, 
mostly bivouacs for soldiers in the Army of 
the Desert Nomads. There are some camps of 
peasants and poorer merchants, as well. 

The Crystal Dagger of Cymorakk will pro 
vide a directional signal to help lead the PCs 
through the maze of the city to the Camp of 
The Master. However, when all directions in 
a circle lead approximately to the same place, 
the Crystal Dagger is of little help. 

The Outer City 

To reach the Camp of The Master, the PCs 
must first enter through the Gate to the Outer 
City. Because of the traffic coming in and out 
of Sayr Ulan, security at the Outer Gate is 
minimal. There are always 24 1st level 
human fighters armed with pikes (AC 8; FI; 
hp 4 each; #AT 1; D 1-10; ML 9; XP 10 each) 
on duty at the Gate. If the PCs take any rea 
sonable precautions, such as disguising 
themselves, and do not call attention to them 
selves, they pass through the gate without 
incident. 

The PCs can also try to sneak over the low 
wall that surrounds the Outer City. Unless 
the PCs are invisible or have taken equivalent 
precautions; there is a 10% chance that they 
will be spotted by a patrol of 24 City Watch 
men (AC 8; hp 4 each; #AT 1; D 1-10; ML 9; 
XP 10 each) led by 2 Hill Giants (AC 4; hp 32 
each; #AT 1; D 2 16; ML 9; XP 650 each). If 
they are spotted; run a chase as shown in 
PART 2. With the entire city against them, 
the chances that the PCs will be caught are 
high. If caught, they are expelled from the 


city. If they try to re-enter, 24 archers on the 
walls shoot at them. 

Each time the PCs enter a circle in the 
Outer City there is a 1 in 4 chance of an 
encounter. Use the Outer City Hazard Table, 
below. 

Hazard Table-Outer City of Sayr Ulan 

1. Three tabi (see MONSTERS AND VIL 
LAINS) are lurking in the shadows of a 
nearby tent. They wait until the charac 
ters pass, then attack one, using their claw 
attack to cause the character to become 
deluded. They use their thief skills to rob 
him of as much as possible, concentrating 
on magic items, then retreat into the 
shadows.

60'(20') flying 240'(80'); #AT 2 daws; D 
1-4/1-4 + delusion; Save M5; ML 6; AL 
C; XP 750 each 

2. Twenty camels are penned in a rope cor 
ral. The smell is noticeable even above the 
other smells of the city. A man is whipping 
one of the camels that has been slow to 
respond to orders. The camel breaks loose 
and rips through the rope corral; the rest 
of the camels stampede into the narrow 
passage, heading directly for the PCs. 

Camels (10): AC 7; HD 2; hp 8 each; MV

Save FI; ML 7; AL N; XP 20 each 

3. Giant scorpions lurk in dark comers 
throughout the city. Three rush out of a 
small tent as the PCs pass by, and attack! 
If the PCs enter the tent after the scorpi 
ons are dead, they find six dead nomads.

D 1-10/IT0/1-4 + poison; Save F2; ML

4. Ten trolls, skirmishers in the Desert 
Nomad army, are on leave. They are pick 
ing fights with peasants and stealing any 
thing that isn't nailed down. They decide 
that the PCs look like a good target.

If the PCs get in a fight or otherwise show 
off, there is a chance that a patrol of City

THE WAR OF THE MASTER 



Watchmen (identical to the gate guards) will 
arrive and try to take the party into custody. 
You should set the chance of this happening 
by the behavior of the PCs-the more outra 
geously they behave* the greater the chance 
of attracting attention. The minimum chance 
should be about 25%; the maximum chance 
can be 100% if the PCs are behaving particu 
larly stupidly. The watch will try to arrest the 
PCs only if someone is seriously hurt or is 
about to be hurt. The watch are unimpressed 
by simple arguments or common brawls- 
these are far too common in a Chaotic army. 

If Lhe PCs get into a fight with the City 
Watch, another patrol of Watchmen, identi 
cal to the first, arrives every 5 minutes. Soon, 
the entire city is alerted. If the PCs wisely 
flee, run a chase as described in THE INVA 
SION OF AKESOLI chapter until the PCs 
escape. 

If there is a fight with the City Watch, the 


guards at the gate to the Inner City are auto 
matically suspicious and careful. 

The Inner City 

The Gate to the Inner City is more care 
fully guarded than the Gate to the Outer City* 
but there is still a good deal of traffic passing 
through. The guards ask each person enter 
ing the city what his business is. Any reason 
able answer (visiting relatives, I live here, 
etc.) will satisfy the guards If the PCs got 
into a fight with the City Watchmen in the 
Outer City, the Inner City guards are on the 
lookout There is a 25% chance the Inner 
City guards will recognise the PCs unless the 
PCs have changed their disguise or taken 
other precautions against recognition. If the 
PCs are recognized, the guards try to arrest 
them. 

The PCs can try to sneak over the wall that 
surrounds the Inner City rather than passing 


through the gate. There is a 25% chance that 
a party of Outer City Watchmen will see 
them climbing over the wall and sound the 
alarm unless the PCs are invisible or have 
taken equivalent precautions. 

The Inner City is a little less horrid than 
the Outer City. There is a 1 in 3 chance of an 
encounter each time the PCs enter a circle on 
the chart; use Hazard Table 2a below. The 
Inner City guard patrols are identical to the 
Outer City. 

Hazard Table-Inner City of Sayr Ulan 

1. As the PCs pass one of the larger and more 
elegant tents* a man steps out and says, 
"Hsst! Come inside! I know who you are 
and I can help you." If the PCs enter the 
tent, they see the man, who is tall and 
handsome, and three beautiful women. 
The tent is elegantly and expensively fur 
nished. 

All four are actually vampires, secretly 
feeding off the troops of The Master's 
army The man, whose name is Abdul, 
wears a Medallion of ESP, which has 
enabled him to discover the PCs' true 
identities and mission. These vampires 
care nothing about the war or The Mas 
ter; they are here because an army is an 
easy source of victims. In order to lure the 
PCs* he gives them information about the 
city, the gate into the Innermost Court of 
The Master* how the guards are struc 
tured, and any other information the 
characters request. As soon as he can get 
the PCs into an unguarded position* he 
and his wives attack,

The coffins of the four vampires are con 
cealed behind a curtain. Their treasure is 
located in the four coffins. The vampires 
have a treasure of 12,000 gp, 3,000 pp, and 
30 pieces of jewelry worth 18,000 gp (worn by 
the wives). They have the following magic 
items: a Medallion of ESP (w orn by Abdul)*

2. A young urchin, a street beggar, 
approaches the PCs and asks for money. If 
the PCs refuse, he follows and continues 
to pester them. If the PCs give him 1 gp or 
more, he first bites down on the coin to see 
if it is real, then begins to bless them 
loudly for their incredible generosity, fol 
lowing them and shouting their praises. 
Immediately, ld20 additional beggars 
approach and begin demanding money, 
complaining loudly if they don't get any, 
and praising loudly if they do. If these 
beggars get money, another ld20 beggars 
show up, and so on. The beggars are all 
Normal Men and do not fight. 

3. A party of four fire giants wearing gleam 
ing bronze armor are weaving through 
the crowded streets. Each is carrying a 
huge earthen mug filled with beer. They 
are obviously drunk, and are singing 
obscene songs in the fire giant language. 
They pick a fight with any party that looks 
at all tough, such as the PCs.

The Camp of the Master 

A wall built from heavy timbers stands in 
the center of the city of Sayr Ulan; the wall is 
topped by sharpened spikes. Within this wall 
is The Master's camp, A third gate leads to 
the Camp of The Master. 

This gate is heavily guarded by 12 stone

enters with a detect good spell, and also has 
an operating detect invisible spell. 

Be fairly strict in adjudicating any strate 
gies the players come up with to overcome 
this obstacle; the guards here are strict and 
reliable in performing their duty. 

Normal Camp Watchman parties contin 
ually patrol the wall, and sound the alarm if 
they detect anyone trying to go over the wall. 
There is a 50% chance per round that a City 
Watch patrol will be in sight of the PCs if they 
try to go over the wall. If the PCs go to a sec 
tion of wall not in range of the magic-user's 
detect invisible spell, go invisible , and climb 
over, they may be successful. 

The Outer Court of the Master^ Camp 

The Camp of The Master also has an outer 
and an inner section. In the outer section 
there are numerous campfires and tents occu 
pied by soldiers of the Legion of Doom. 
There are approximately 240 2nd level fight 
ers, 40 3rd level magic-users, 20 stone giants, 
and 2 stone juggernauts in the camp. If they 
become alerted to the PCs presence, use 
BATTLESYSTEM 1 * rules to run any battle 
or chase that results. The soldiers in the outer 
section are not particularly alert, but will 
respond to any untoward disturbance or 
alarm. 

The Inner Court of the Master's Camp 

Approximately 120 feet inside the wall is a 
second stockade wall, A gate leads inside to 
the inner courtyard where The Master and 
his elite servants reside. This gate is guarded 
by a patrol identical to the patrol along the 
outer gate, and the perimeter of the inner 
wall is patrolled by the City Watch. There is a 
100% chance of a City Watch patrol being in 
sight of the PCs at all times. 

Refer to the map showing the layout of the 
Inner Court of the Camp of The Master 

A* Gate to the Inner Court. 

B. Watch Towers. Each lower is occupied 
by a 5th level magic-user, identical in stats 
and spells to the commander of the Gate 
Guards. Each keeps a detect good and detect 
invisible spell operating on the section of wall 
for w'hich they are responsible. 


C. Guard Tents. Each tent is occupied by 
four stone giants, currently off duty. 

D. Guard Tents. Each tent is occupied by 
four 5th level magic-users, currently off duty. 

E. Courtiers. Each tent is occupied by 
courtiers who serve The Master, One tent is 
filled with The Master's harem, another with 
The Master's executive assistants, another 
with royal hostages of the realms that are sub 
ject to him. These hostages will not leave or 
fight on the side of the PCs unless the Desert 
Nomad armies are completely defeated, 

F. Tent of The Master, See the section that 
follows for a complete description. 

G. Airboat, This airboat carries its skele 
ton crew and is ready for The Master's 
escape, if need be. 

The Masters Tent 

The largest and most opulent tent in the 
Inner Court is occupied by The Master and 
Alrethus, his chief aide (if Alrethus survived 
the battle with the Allied Expeditionary 
Force), 

The tent is approximately 30 feet in diame 
ter, made of the finest silks embroidered w ith 
gold. The floor of the tent is carpeted in the 
finest hand-made rugs, each worth over 
5,000 gp. The furnishings are made of gold, 
silver, and platinum; many are studded with 
gems. The total value of the tent and its fur 
nishings is 250,000 gp. 

A long damask-covered table is piled high 
with gourmet delicacies. A mahogany desk is 
obviously where The Master works, A luxu 
rious canopied bed occupies a large part of 
the room. In one corner is a strange, pulsing 
red gem on an elaborate wrought gold 
pedestal-the Soul-Gem of Thanatos. 

Stone giant guards flank the front entrance 
to the tent. The PCs can enter through the 
front, or they can slice through the tent mate 
rial and enter from any point. Whenever the 
PCs enter the room, The Master is sitting at 
his desk, writing with a huge quill pen. If 
Alrethus is still alive, he is standing at The 
Master's side. The Master looks up as the 
PCs enter, and says, 


"Welcome, I have eagerly aw r aited your 
arrival, both for what you've done-and 
for what you carry." 


In the encounter that follows, The Mas 
ter's goal is to take the Crystal Dagger to 
insure the safety of the Soul-Gem of Thana 
tos. However, the dagger is so aligned against 
evil that neither The Master nor Alrethus will 
actually touch it. This makes it easier for the 
PCs to retain the weapon and destroy the 


31 









THE WAR OF THE MASTER 


Soul-Gem, See the special encounter. Quest 
for the Soul-Gem for more details. 

If the PCs were captured in the battle, they 
are put to sleep by The Master's powerful 
magic, and brought to The Master's tent. All 
their magic items are taken and placed on the 
long table-including the Crystal Dagger of 
Cymorakk. 

The Master believes he has nothing to fear 
from the player characters, so he is quite 
careless about guards, confident he can han 
dle the situation himself. When the PCs start 
firing spells and trying to grab their magic 
items from the table, The Master laughs. 
"Go ahead," he says. "Resistance is futile, as 
you will see." 

The Final Conflict 

The Master cannot be harmed by anything 
the party does. Damage done to The Master 
heals the next round. Magic that immobilizes 
The Master affects him for only one round. 
Even the Crystal Dagger does no harm if 
used as a weapon against The Master him 
self. Because of this. The Master toys with 
the party. He uses his magic in a non-lethal 
fashion. As he docs so, he talks to the PCs 
about the hopelessness and futility of their 
actions, laughing sinisterly as he does so. 


"It has amused me to watch your move 
ments against me," he says, "They were 
as futile as they were resourceful. Your 
diplomacy will come to naught; my forces 
are too powerful. And now, you are in my 
power, and you have brought me the only 
item I feared-the Crystal Dagger of 
Cymorakk . For that, I shall make your 
deaths painless and quick," 


If the PCs still have the Crystal Dagger, 
The Master uses all his spells and resources to 
capture it. If he obtains the Crystal Dagger, 
he laughs and says, "Now, even your last 
hope is gone, and soon your life-force will be 
sacrificed to the Soul-Gem of Thanatosl 
Poor, pitiful wretches. Did you really believe 
you could defeat me? " 

The only way The Master can be defeated 
is for a PC to plunge the Crystal Dagger of 
Cymorakk into the heart of the Soul- Gem of 
Thanatos, thereby destroying both objects. 
The PC who does this immediately takes 100 
hp of electrical damage (saving throw vs. 
Death Ray for half damage) and drops 
unconscious for 1-10 rounds (no saving 
throw). 


When this takes place, both artifacts 
explode in a blinding light. The Master 
screams, "NO! NO! NO!" and then 
turns to you. "You have no idea what 
you've done! I'll crush you! I'll destroy 
you! How dare you!" Within second, The 
Master has aged centuries. 


The Master will survive five more rounds 
of combat. With each round, he becomes 
older and older. His face wrinkles and his hair 
vanishes. His skin pulls tightly to his bones, 
giving him a skeletal look. The aging process 
is rapid and horrible to behold. The damage 
caused by the PCs no longer vanishes after a 
round (but The Master still cannot die until 
the five rounds arc up). 

W r hen the fifth round begins, The Master 
automatically wins initiative, but does not 
attack. 


Suddenly, The Master stops fighting and 
looks up, ignoring you. He speaks to a 
presence only he can see, "I need more 
time! You promised me power enough to 
do your will! It isn't fair to take it away 
now! I was faithful to you! Don't aban 
don me! Don't...no! NO!" 

With the last plaintive cry, The Master 
begins to decay before your eyes. The 
flesh melts from his bones and the skeleton 
itself begins to crumble. Within moments, 
only a pitiful pile of dust and a spreading 
stain of decay on the carpet remains. 


If Aire thus is still alive, he runs for the air- 
boat outside. If he reaches it first, he com 
mands it to fly away, and Aire thus is never 
seen again (until the next time). 

Escape From Sayr Ulan 

The last cries of The Master have alerted 
all the guards. Such news travels fast, and the 
PCs will shortly find the entire city aroused 
against them. 

The easiest way for the PCs to escape is by 
commandeering the airboat and flying away. 
The skeletons will obey the commands of 
anyone who holds the tiller at the stern of the 
boat. 

If the airboat is gone, or the PCs do not 
think of using it, they must escape through 
the streets of Sayr Ulan. The entire town is 
(or shortly will be) aroused against them. 
Roll twice each mm (10 minutes) for addi 
tional pursuit; the chance of additional pur 
suit is 50% each roll. If the dice indicate more 
pursuit, there is a 25% chance of an Inner 
Gate guard patrol (stone giants and magic- 


user), a 50% chance of a City Watch patrol, 
and a 25 % chance of a party from the Outer 
City Hazard Table. 

Once the PCs escape Sayr Ulan, use the 
strategic level map to record their movement 
back to civilization. 

Aftermath of the Great War 

As soon as The Master is destroyed, all 
Desert Nomad units suffer an immediate 
penalty of -40 to BR. Units of countries allied 
to the Desert Nomads suffer an immediate 
penalty of -20 to BR. However, the war con 
tinues in spite of The Master's death until 
either all the civilized lands are conquered 
(this is still a possibility) or until the Desert 
Nomads and their allies have lost 50 % of the 
units with which they started the war. When 
this happens, the remaining Desert Nomad 
units retreat off into the Sind, never to be 
seen again. 

If a countr> r allied to the Nomads loses 
50% of the forces with which it began the 
war, it retreats into its own borders and fights 
only to keep itself from being conquered by 
Darokin or its allies. 

When the PCs return to the city of Darokin 
(or, if Darokin has fallen, to whatever city is 
currently the headquarters of the Darokiman 
Army), they are welcomed as befits great 
heroes. They are knighted and given military 
honors and decorations. In addition, each 
party member is given an estate in Darokin 
that provides an annual income of 10,000 
gold pieces. This money can be collected once 
per game year w r hether or not the PCs decide 
to live on their estates. If the PCs decide to 
manage the estates personally, and become 
citizens of Darokin, the annual income from 
the estates doubles to 20,000 gp. PCs can 
build country estates or castles with the 
money, 

A war of this scope should result in perma 
nent changes in the D&D(r) game campaign 
world. The pattern of alliances that devel 
oped should help determine friendships 
among the countries for years to come. The 
PCs are heroes in Darokin and in the allied 
nations, but are considered evil conquerors 
in the nations that allied with the Nomads. It 
is possible that the defeated nations may try 
to assassinate the PCs, 

Now that every nation in the D&D(r) game 
campaign world has a standing army, you 
may choose to have other wars occur from 
time to time. Countries go to war for a variety 
of reasons: honor, natural resources, money, 
expansionism. The victorious countries may 
decide to annex portions of the defeated 
nations, thereby changing the political map 


32 







THE WAR OF THE MASTER 


of the world. The defeated nations may 
decide to get revenge, or to throw the foreign 
oppressors out. 

These wars can provide a springboard for 
many more adventures. The PCs can lead 
armies into battle, using either the War 
Machine or BATTLESYSTEM(tm) rules, or 
they can find themselves adventuring in an 
area that suddenly becomes a battlezone. 

If your campaign is ready to move from the 
D&D(r) Expert Set into the D&D(r) Compan 


ion Set, your characters may decide to leave 
the civilized lands in the south for the new 
wilderness in Norwold, described in CMJ r 
Test of the Hkrlonds, Even if characters move 
to Norwold to seek their fortunes and to build 
nations of their own, continue to keep track of 
political and military events in the south. 
Perhaps the PCs will find that they cannot 
leave behind the lands where they began their 
adventuring careers as easily as they thought. 

In the D&D(r) Basic Set, you began your 


campaign as a series of dungeon adventures. 
In the D&D(r) Expert Set, you have added the 
great wilderness to your campaign. In this 
adventure, your characters have become 
involved for the first time in the great political 
affairs of the world-which is one of the 
things the exciting D&D(r) Companion Set is 
all about. 

One phase of your campaign is coming to 
an end, but a new and exciting phase is just 
about to start!

THE WAR MACHINE REDUX 


The War Machine is a system of game 
rules designed to resolve large battles in the 
D&D(r) game, and appears in full in the 
D&D(r) Companion Set, Only part of the War 
Machine system is reprinted here; for the 
complete system, refer to the D&D(r) Com 
panion Set. 

The large-scale movement rules are new, 
and are applicable only to this adventure, or 
to another adventure when the map scale is 1 
hex = 24 miles and I game turn = 1 week. 
This scale has required several minor modifi 
cations to the War Machine rules that should 
not be applied in general Those modifica 
tions are noted where they appear, 

How It Works 

Each body of troops (called a l£ force") is 
given a rating that defines their quality. When 
combat occurs, this *' Battle Rating" (BR) is 
modified for battle conditions (terrain, num 
ber of opponents, morale, etc,). Each player 
then rolls d% and adds the modified BR of the 
troops. The high total wins the battle. 

When a force is first hired and outfitted, 
you must calculate its " Basic Force Rating" 
(BFR) and the £i Troop Class " For the vari 
ous military units in this adventure, those 
calculations have already been made. The 
BFR is modified to calculate the BR, but the 
BFR is not used in combat. The BR and 
Movement Rate (MV) are printed on the 
counter. The Troop Class and number of 
troops in each unit are given in the Armies 
booklet. 

If you w f ant to learn how to calculate BFR, 
BR, and Troop Class, you will need to have 
the complete War Machine, However, you 
can use the following system to create an 
approximate BR as follows: 

Quick Battle Ratings 

The following " Quick BR System" will give 
an approximate BR for most troops, IF you 
have an extremely powerful force (because of 
level, abilities, hit dice, etc.) you will probably 
be better off with the full process.

Dividing a Force 

To use the War Machine in a battle, each 
side must have the same number of forces or 
armies. If one side has a greater number of 
forces than the other side, the side with fewer 
forces must be divided in such a way that 
both sides have the same number of forces or 
armies. The divided forces may keep the 
original BR of the force if all troop types are 
divided evenly among the new forces. If the 
troops are not evenly divided, a new BR must 
be calculated lor each new force. If you are 
not playing w r ith the full War Machine rules 
in the Companion Set, you are strongly 
urged to keep force divisions proportional for 
ease of play. 

.Example. 1,000 ores (BR 72) meet 3 other 
forces: 200 elves (BR 83), 400 men (BR 70), 
and 140 dwarves (BR 88), The ores must 
therefore split into 3 forces. The owning 
player decides to divide them into two units 
of 333 each and one unit of 334, thus main 
taining the current BR (72), Different combi 
nations, with different BRs for each, are 
possible; however, the minimum size of a 
force is 10 individuals per force. 

The players choose opponents. The force 
with the highest BR (in this case, the 
dwarves) picks an opponent first. The next 
highest-rated force (in this case, the elves) 
choose next. The third highest-rated force is 
the ores, who then get to choose. In this case, 
only the men are left. However, if the ore 
force had split into three units of different 
sizes and different BRs, the order of choosing 
opponents would have been more important. 

Determining Combat Results 

Modifying the Battle Rating for Combat 

When a battle occurs, the BR of each force 
is modified based on the troop ratio, Morale, 
environment, terrain, fatigue, and other fac 
tors, The modified BR is used to determine 
the actual combat results. 

To modify the BR of each force, add or 
subtract all of the following adjustments that 
apply. The adjustments are explained in the 
notes that follow the tables. 

1, Troop Ratio (use only one per battle): 


+ 15 if 1,5 to 1 
+ 30 if 2 to 1 
+ 45 if 3 to 1 
+ 60 if 4 to 1 
+ 70 if 5 to 1 
+ 80 if 6 to 1 
+ 90 if 7 to 1 
+ 100 if 8, 9, or 10 to 1 
+ 110 if 11-15 to 1 
+ 120 if 16-20 to 1 
+ 130 if 21-30 to 1 
+ 140 if 31-40 to 1 
+ 150 if 41-50 to 1 
+ 160 if 51-60 to 1, etc. 

2. Morale (use all that apply): 

+ 10 if force is in dominion of their liege 
+ 10 if they have beaten this foe before 
+ 10 if Troop Class is 2 levels higher than the 
enemy 

+ 30 if attacking enemy "On the March" 
-10 if any accompanying force has routed 

When using 1 hex = 24 mile scale, an accom 
panying force is any friendly force in the 
same or adjacent hex during the current 
game turn. 

3. Environment (use all that apply): 

+ 25 if in extremely favorable environment 
-25 if in extremely unfavorable environment 
+ 20 if the entire force in a night batde has 
Infravision 

4. Terrain (use all that apply): 

+ 20 if higher than opponent 
+ 20 for Halfling force in fields or woods 
+ 10 for Elven force in woods 
+ 20 for Dwarven force in hills or mountains 
-20 for force with mounted troops in moun 
tains, woods, or stronghold 
-20 for force in mire (marsh/mud)* 

-10 for force on shifting ground (snow/sand)* 

* Does not apply to troops properly equipped 
and trained for that terrain, or native to the 
terrain, e.g., desert nomads in the desert. 

5. Immunities (use only 1 per force): 

+ 150 if force is immune to enemy 's attacks 
+ 50 if 1 % or more of force is immune to ene 
my's attacks 

+ 50 if force is immune to 80%-99% of ene 
my's attacks 

6. Fatigue (use only 1 per force): 

-10 if force is moderately fatigued 
-30 if force is seriously fatigued 














THE WAR MACHINE REDUX 


DEFENDER ONLY ADJUSTMENTS: 
(Ignore if all attackers can fly; use only half of 
adjustment if 5 % or more of attackers can fly. ) 

+ 1Q if defending in place (holding) 

+ 50 if defending a narrow defile, pass, or 
bridge 

+ 40 if attacker must cross deep water 
(including river) 

+ 20 if defending in mountains, hills, or 
rough terrain, or behind a wall 
+ 50 if force is in a stronghold (and see 
"Sieges") 

Explanation of Adjustments and Terms 

1. Troop Ratio: Find the total number of 
troops in each force, and divide the larger 
number by the smaller. Fractions are 
rounded in favor of the defender. Example: If 
the total is 1.5 to L99 s the 1.5 ratio is used, 
and so forth. Only the larger side benefits 
from this adjustment, and only one benefit 
applies. 

Steeds are only counted as members of a 
force if their primary function is fighting 
(such as dragons) and not transportation 
(such as horses). 

2. Morale: This reflects the confidence of a 
force. Troops that fight in their home terri 
tory, that know that they can beat an oppo 
nent, or arc of superior quality to the foe may 
benefit from one, some, or all of these. 

3. Environment: Certain conditions may 
harm or help a force. Goblins in the daylight 
are at a disadvantage, as are fire giants in the 
snow. 

4. Terrain: In many cases, ihe ground on 
which the battle is fought will give an advan 
tage to one side or the other. Apply as many 
of these modifiers as fit each force. Note that 
some modifiers apply only to defenders. 

Determining the Defender: When two 
forces arrive at the same location, they must 
stop moving. If both forces choose to defend, 
neither gets the defender bonus, (See also the 
special Movement Rules, which help define 
the defender when using the 1 hex = 24 mile 
map scale.) 

5. Immunities: This reflects the advantage 
possessed by some creatures who cannot be 
hit by normal weapons; gargoyles and lycan- 
thropes are some examples, 

6. Fatigue: Troops may become fatigued as a 
Combat Result of a previous battle (see the 
Combat Results Table) or because of a forced 
march. 


Tactics 

Before each battle, each commander 
secretly chooses a Tactic from the Tactics 
Table. To indicate the choice, place a d6 on 
the table in front of you with the number of 
the plan face up, and cover it with your hand 
so that your opponent does not see the num 
ber, After both players have calculated the 
modified BR of their forces, but before they 
have made their Combat Rolls (see Deter 
mining Combat Results) both players reveal 
their tactical choices at the same time. 
(Remember, the d6 is not rolled randomly; 
the die is placed to show each player's choice 
of tactic. Do not use the same die that is used 
for making Combat Rolls.) If it is conven 
ient, each player can write his tactic number 
on a scrap of paper and reveal it at the proper 
time. 

Cross-reference the two Tactics using the 
Tactics Table. If the result is NC/NC, no bat 
tle occurs. All other outcomes are added to 
the result from the Combat Results Table. 
(NOTE: It does not matter which side is Side 
A and which is Side B,)

Combat Rolls 

After players have determined the result 
from the Tactics Table (see Tactics), each 
player rolls d% (a Combat Roll), and adds 
the modified BR to the Combat Roll result. 
The total is the Combat Result. The player 
with the highest Combat Result wins the bat 
tle. 

Applying Combat Results 

When the winner and loser of a battle have 
been identified, determine the effects of the 
battle (casualties, fatigue, location, etc.) as 
follows: 

Subtract the loser's Combat Result from 
the winner's Combat Result, and find the dif 
ference in the left-hand column of the Com 
bat Results Table, This line of the table lists 
the result for both forces. 

Immediately subtract casualties from each 
force from the total in the Armies booklet. If 
one or more sides are Fatigued, place Moder 
ately Fatigued or Seriously Fatigued markers 
on the units on the game map. 

When using the 1 hex - 24 mile scale, 
"Location" results (except "Rout") are used 
only when one force chooses to leave the bat 
tlefield (see "Withdrawal," below). A Loca 
tion result of "Rout" means that the routing 
force ceases to exist as an army; see the sec 
tion on "Routed Units" for more detail.

Combat Result Notes 

Casualties: When subtracting casualties, 

consider half of them as dead and the other 
half as wounded. Until they return to action, 
they cannot be considered as part of that 
force's current troop strength. 

If a force holds the field after the battle, 
wounded troops can return to action in 4-16 
weeks. If a force retreats from the field, treat 
all wounded as killed. If a unit with wounded 
troops receives a Rout result in combat, all 
wounded troops are automatically considered 
to have been killed. 

When a force contains mixed troops (such 
as trolls and goblins), the casualties must be 
split as evenly as possible between them. 

In this adventure, make a note after each 
battle of how many wounded troops, if any, 
are with the unit. Roll 4d4 f and note after 
each group of wounded troops the week/ 
game turn they can return to action. 

Fatigue: Moderately fatigued troops return 
to normal in 1 game turn. Seriously fatigued 
troops become moderately fatigued after 1 
game turn. Fatigue has an effect on combat 
and on Forced Marching (see Scenario 
Rules). 

Location: Location results are described fully 
in the complete War Machine rules in the 
D&D(r) Companion Set, They are applied 
when the map scale is a smaller ratio, such as 
5 hex " 1 mile. See the Conducting Battle 
rules that follow on multiple rounds of com 


bat during a single turn, and effects of victo 
ries won in previous rounds, 

Mercy 

After a battle is fought and casualties have 
been determined, the winner of the battle 
may choose to show mercy to the loser. If so, 
this must be declared before the loser's casu 
alties have been subtracted. When Mercy is 
shown, apply the following effects immedi 
ately : 

1. The loser's casualties are cut in half. 

2, All wounded may be recovered, even if the 
loser has been driven from the field, 

3. A + 2 bonus applies to all the loser's future 
Reaction Rolls involving the winner (includ 
ing both leaders). 

4, If the loser fights the wanner again within 
52 weeks, the loser receives a -20 penalty to 
BR for that battle. 

Sieges 

If a force inside a city or town hex is 
attacked by another force, the force inside the 
town or city hex is automatically considered 
the defender. If the defender chooses to leave 
the "town or city hex, either to face the enemy 
head-on or to attempt an escape, the battle is 
resolved normally. If the defender remains 
inside the city or town hex, a siege occurs. 
Use the following rules for sieges. 

In a siege, the defender receives the following 
benefits: 

1. When calculating the Troop Ratio, multi 
ply the number of defending troops by 4. 

2. The defender ignores any "Rout" results. 

3. AH defender casualties are reduced by 
50%. Round all fractions up. 

The attacker has the following options: 

1. The attacker can attack normally, using 
the above rules; OR 

2. The attacker can "besiege" the defender 
by surrounding the town and keeping the 
defenders within the structure. This adds + 5 
to the attacker's modified BR for each week 
of the siege (the adjustment vanishes when 
the siege ends). This BR bonus represents the 
building of siege engines, and mining to 
weaken the defender's position. 

Each week that a siege lasts, the attacker 
can choose to make a normal attack against 
the defender, or continue to besiege. If he 
attacks, the attacker adds the +5 BR/per 


week that he has earned so far. He does not 
receive a + 5 BR bonus in the week of the 
attack (the army was preparing for the assault 
instead). 

In a siege, the defender's ability to resist 
depends upon his food supply. If the defender 
has clerics of enough power to create magical 
food and water for the besieged force, the 
defender can resist a siege indefinitely. If not, 
the defending player must determine how 
long the food supply inside the city or town 
will last (if no number suggests itself, use 4 
weeks). Once food is exhausted, the defender 
loses 10% of his troops (not BR points) each 
week until the siege ends. 

War Machine Optional Rules 

The War Machine optional rules concern 
ing Character Actions, Surprise, Leader 
Loss, and PC Heroics are not used in this 
adventure. Any battle involving PCs should 
be fought using the BATTLESYSTEM(tm) 
rules. When using War Machine rules to 
fight battles on the map that do not involve 
PCs, the DM should command Desert 
Nomad forces while the players control Daro- 
kin forces. 

Scenario Rules 

The following rules apply only to this 
adventure and to wars fought on a 1 hex = 24 
mile map and a 1 game turn * 1 week time 
scale. They replace and supercede all War 
Machine rules concerning Troop Movement 
from the D&D(r) Companion Set for this pur 
pose. 

Game Map 

A large map is provided in the game. 
Because this adventure normally takes sev 
eral playing sessions to complete, try to find a 
place where the map can be left set up. If you 
cannot, you will have to record the hex loca 
tion of the various armies at the end of each 
playing session in order to set up again for 
subsequent playing sessions. 

The map scale is 1 hexagon (hex) = 24 
miles. 

During play, use small pieces of tape to 
hold down the corners of the map. This keeps 
the map stationary and taut. 

Game Pieces 

A sheet of counters is provided in the 
game. The individual counters represent the 
forces that make up the armies of the individ 
ual kingdoms throughout the D&D(r) game 
campaign world. These counters are "units " 
Other counters, called "markers," represent

other game functions: keeping track of game 
turns, recording the fatigue level of individ 
ual units, and showing which units are cur 
rently encamped.

may be fought in a single game turn. The 
counter sheet contains counters marked "xf* 
and M xlO." Place the "xl" counter on Turn 1 
of the Game lorn Track on the game map to 
begin the game, and advance it one space at 
the conclusion of each game turn. When the 
game reaches Turn 11, place the rt xlO" 
counter and the "xl" counter both on the 
Turn 1 space. Move the "xlO" counter ahead 
one space for each ten game turns. 

Order of Play 

The Desert Nomads and their allies move 
first in a game turn, and Darokin and its 
allies moves second. 

Movement 

The map scale is 1 hex ¦ 24 miles. Each 
unit has a Movement Rate (MV) in hexes. 
Infantry units have an MV of 4, cavalry units 
have an MV of 6, and the party of player 
characters has an MV of 10. (Note that there 
are two counters provided for the PCs; this 
allows the party to split up if desired. If the 
PCs splits into more groups than there are 
counters, make new counters or use the backs 
of counters not currently in use,) 

A unit may use some, none, or all of its 
movement rate each game turn, A unit's 
movement rate can be affected by terrain, by 
fatigue, by supply status, or by forced march 
ing. A unit cannot store up movement from 
turn to turn. 

Terrain Effects on Movement 

Terrain conditions affect movement rates 
according to the following table: 

Terrain Table 

Terrain Type Movement Effect 

Clear No Effect 


NOTES: 

1) No penalty for halflings or elves 

2) No penalty for halflings or dwarves 

3) No penalty for dwarves or gnomes 

4) No penalty for desert inhabitants 

5) Certain units can travel across oceans as 
special ability; see Order of Battle 

Forced Marches 

A force may attempt a Forced March to 
increase its movement rate, but this might 
not be successful. To attempt a force march, 
roll ld6 and consult the following table, A 
force that is Seriously Fatigued may not 
attempt a forced march.

but that the force becomes Seriously Fatigued 
afterward. 

Interception Combat 

Any unit that enters or passes through a 


hex adjacent to a enemy unit has been spot 
ted. If the spotted unit continues to move in 
the same turn, the non-moving unit may be 
eligible to move and attack out of turn. This 
is called an interception attack. 

A unit can be intercepted if it intends to 
leave the hex in which it was spotted and 
enter a hex that does not contain the unit that 
spotted it. 

If the non-moving player wants to inter 
cept, both players roll an Initiative die. If the 
non-moving player wins the roll, the inter 
ception is a success, and his units are immedi 
ately moved to the hex containing the 
intercepted units; the intercepted units can 
not move until after the combat, when they 
can move normally. If the moving player wins 
initiative, the interception fails. 

If an interception succeeds, the intercept 
ing player must attack. 

A unit can make several interception 
attempts in a single enemy movement phase, 
but it can participate in only one successful 
attempt (and attack) per turn. A single unit 
can be intercepted several times insa single 
move, as long as each interception is by a dif 
ferent force. 

The interception procedure cannot be used 
to prevent a unit from moving directly from 
the hex where it was spotted to the hex in 
which the spotting units are located, for pur 
poses of normal combat. 

A player must decide if he will try for an 
interception at the time he becomes eligible to 
try it. If he refuses to try it, he cannot change 
his mind later. 

Conducting Combat 

To conduct combat, a unit must move into 
the hex occupied by an enemy unit. This ends 
the unit's movement for that turn. Once this 
is done, combat must occur. Up to three 
rounds of combat can occur in a single game 
turn. Each round of combat is fought accord 
ing to the War Machine rules. Casualties are 
taken for each round. 

For the first round of combat in a game 
turn, the player moving into the hex is the 
attacker, and the other player, the defender. 
For each subsequent round of combat, make 
a normal Initiative roll using ld6. The win 
ner of the roll chooses whether to attack or 
defend for the next round. 

If, after three rounds of combat, neither 
force has been destroyed or routed, and nei 
ther force has elected to withdraw or retreat, 
the units remain in the same hex until the 
next game turn, and combat continues. 

Either unit in a hex can attempt to with 
draw from combat by choosing the Withdraw 


37 









THE WAR MACHINE REDUX 


tactic. If the opposing player chose anything 
other than the Attack + tactic, the withdraw 
ing unit may move 1 hex away, regardless of 
whether the unit had already used its full 
movement rate for the current game turn, 
once combat for that round has been 
resolved. If both players choose Withdraw, 
no combat takes place and both units move 1 
hex away If one player chooses Withdraw 
and the other chooses Attack + , the attacker 
receives the On the March bonus, in addition 
to the result on the Tactics Table, 

Since a withdrawing unit remains adjacent 
to its opponent, the opponent may choose to 
attack under the Interception rule before the 
withdrawing unit can move away. 

The Location column of the Combat 
Results Table lists various Retreat results. 
Because of the game scale in this adventure, 
the R + and F + results do not refer to map 
hexes. However, they can be used to break off 
contact with the enemy, as follows: 

If the loser of a round of combat is required 
to retreat farther than the winner can pursue, 
the loser of that round can choose to With 
draw and move 1 hex away. Combat for that 
round has ended. (Example: The F/R + 1 
and the F + 1/R + 3 results allow the loser to 
break contact with the foe; the F/R and F +3/ 
R + 2 results do not/) 

If the winner of a round of combat receives 
any F + result (F + 1 or greater), the winner 
can choose to Withdraw and move 1 hex 
away. 

Victory and Defeat 

A unit is considered to be the Victor in a 
battle if it destroyed or routed the enemy 
unit, or if it inflicted greater casualties on the 
enemy than it received. A victor is deter 
mined after the entire combat is over, not 
after each round of combat. 

The victor of a battle receives a permanent 
+ 1 bonus to ER each time (BR cannot be 
increased more than +10 this way); the loser 
receives a permanent -I to BR only if it routs 
(BR cannot be reduced more than 10 point 
this way). Make a note of which unit the vic 
torious unit defeated; it receives a bonus to 
morale if it fights the unit again. 

Routed Units 

If a unit routs, subtract the casualties 
required by the final round of combat, then 
roll Id 10 to find how many weeks pass before 
the survivors return home. Place the unit on 
the Game Turn Track for the turn in which it 
will reappear Subtract 50% of the remaining 
troops of the routed unit, and record the final 
strength of the unit in the Armies booklet. 
Subtract 1 from the unit's permanent BR 


(maximum of-10). 

On the appropriate game turn, place the 
routed unit on the capital city hex of its home 
kingdom. 

Stacking 

Units friendly to each other can freely 
move through each other's hexes during 
movement, but no more than two friendly 
units can end their move stacked together. 
This restriction is intended to prevent battles 
from becoming too complex and time- 
consuming, Battles involving PCs, using the 
BATTLESYSTEM(tm) rules, will become 
unwieldy if too many units are involved. 

The stacking limit applies only to units. 
Any number of markers can be placed in a 
hex, and the Character Party and Master's 
Agents counters do not count as units for 
stacking. 

Combining Units 

Two units can be combined into a larger 
unit at the owning player's discretion, if the 
two units are of the same nationality. 

The new unit has the total personnel of 
both units added together. To calculate the 
BR of the new unit, divide the troop size of 
the smaller unit by the troop size of the larger 
unit. Multiply that fraction by the BR of the 
smaller unit. If the BR of the smaller unit is 
greater than the BR of the larger unit, add 
Lhe result to the BR of the larger unit; other 
wise, subtract the result to get the BR of the 
new unit. 

Supply 

To remain in supply, a unit must be able to 
trace a Line of Supply back to the capital city 
of its homeland. The line cannot pass 
through an impassable hex or a hex contain 
ing an enemy unit, A line of supply cannot 
pass through a hex adjacent to an enemy unit 
unless a friendly unit is in the hex being 
traced through, 

A unit that cannot trace a line of supply at 
the end of a game turn is Out of Supply. A 
unit that is out of supply for an entire game 
turn becomes Moderately Fatigued. If the 
unit is already Moderately Fatigued, it 
becomes Seriously Fatigued. 

A unit that is out of supply for two entire 
game turns becomes seriously fatigued. 

A seriously fatigued unit that is out of sup 
ply cannot move. It fights only when 
attacked. 

If an out of supply unit becomes in supply 
again, it immediately removes any fatigue it 
received as a result of being out of supply 
However, fatigue caused as a Combat Result 


or Forced March Result is not affected. 

Encampment 

A unit can build a Camp by spending one 
full game turn without moving or fighting. 
An out of supply unit cannot build a camp. 
(If a unit attempting to build a camp is 
attacked, the camp cannot be built that turn,) 
When a camp is built, place a Camp marker 
in the hex. The camp remains in the hex until 
destroyed, even if the unit that built it leaves 
the hex. 

A unit encamped for one game turn auto 
matically removes all fatigue. A unit 
encamped for two game turns can return 
50% of its wounded to full fighting status. 

If an encamped unit is attacked, it is auto 
matically the defender, and receives the + 10 
bonus for defending in place and the +20 
bonus for being "behind a wall." 

Rei n fore e men ts 

Each nation is assumed to recruit or draft 
new soldiers throughout the war. These 
enlistments can bring any one unit back up to 
full strength once per game turn. To receive 
this benefit, a unit must occupy a capital city 
hex for one entire game turn. 

Combining War Machine Rules 
with the BATTLESYSTEM(tm) Fan 
tasy Combat Supplement 

The War Machine rules as modified in this 
adventure are used only for combat that does 
not involve the player characters and their 
personal troops. Counters that represent the 
PCs and their troops are provided so that 
their movement relative to other forces can be 
monitored. When the PCs or their units come 
into contact with any enemy forces, use the 
BATTLESYSTEM(tm) rules for resolving the 
combat. 

Of course, you can use the BATTLESYS- 
TEM(tm) Supplement to resolve any of the bat 
tles in this adventure, but you will find it 
much more time-consuming than War 
Machine. 

Certain terms, such as "Rout," have very 
different meanings in the RATTLESYS- 
TEM(tm) rules and in the War Machine rules. 
Apply the meaning that is appropriate for the 
system you are using for the individual com 
bat. 

Order of Battle 

Because the forces of The Master begin the 
war by a pre-emptive attack on the city of 
Akesoli, the forces of the Desert Nomads 
receive a free turn to begin the adventure. 


38 



THE WAR MACHINE REDUX 


Mobilization of the Army of Darokin takes 
one full turn, so the Desert Nomads can move 
unopposed on the second turn, as well. After 
that, Darokin and its allies (as it recruits 
them) can move and fight normally. 

Not all units appear on the board simulta 
neously. Both the armies of the Desert 
Nomads and of Darokin follow a regular 
reinforcements schedule in getting new 
troops. The arrival of the troops of other 
kingdoms depends largely on the diplomatic 
efforts of the player characters. The sched 
uled arrival and location of the forces of each 
country are according to the following table. 

Do not place units on the map until the 
owning country enters the war. The player or 
side that controls the country can place the 
units as desired, within the limits of the 
Order of Battle below. 

ARMY OF THE DESERT NOMADS 

Turn 1: Legion of Doom, lst-4th Army 
Headquarters, lst-20th Divisions. Place the 
Legion of Doom counter on the city of Sayr 
Ulan. Remaining units can be placed any 
where to the west of the border with 
Atruaghin and Darokin, and south of Lake 
Hast. 

Turn 4: 5th Army Headquarters, 2lst-25th 
Divisions. These units arrive on the western 
map edge between the Salt Swamp and the 
mountains to the north. 

Turn 8: 6th Army Headquarters, lst-8th 
Guards. These units arrive on the western 
map edge like the 5th Army. 

ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC OF DARO 
KIN 

Turn 2: Legions I-XV, Place these units any 
where within the Republic of Darokin bor 
ders east of Lake Amsorak. 

Turn 3 + ; Legions XVI-XXX. Each game 
turn beginning with Turn 3, place 2 Legions 
in hexes adjoining the city of Darokin. If 
Darokin falls to the enemy, place new legions 
in Akorros, which becomes the new capital 
city. If Akorros also falls, Corunglain 
becomes the capital. If Corunglain falls, 
Selenica becomes the capital. If all its cities 
fall to the enemy, Darokin is defeated. All 
legions on the game map surrender to the 
enemy, and no new legions arrive,

Juggernauts are huge magical machines. 
They look like houses, pyramids, or statues 
mounted on great rollers. They are magically 
animated and have some awareness of their 
surroundings, allowing them to hunt and kill. 
They are made of wood or stone. 

Juggernauts are very maneuverable. They 
can stop, back up, or turn in one round, 
allowing them to attack creatures in front, 
behind, or alongside in the same round. They 
attack by rolling over the victim with their 
huge wheels. These rollers are 30' wide, 
making it possible for juggernauts to attack 
more than one target in their path. If there is 
only one target in a given direction, the 
attack is made normally. If there are two or 
more targets in the path, each target is first 
allowed to make a saving throw vs. Dragon 
Breath, Targets that make their saving throw 
have managed to get out of the path of the 
juggernaut. Those that fail their saving throw 
will be hit by the juggernaut if it rolls its hit 
roll number against that target. A separate 
roll is made for each target. 

All juggernauts have the same immunities: 
all non-magical missile fire, sleep , charm , 
and hold spells, and poison. 

A juggernaut carries its treasure inside it. 


The treasure may be found only after the 
creature is dead. 

WOOD JUGGERNAUT: This type of jug 
gernaut normally appears as a large wooden 
building on rollers. It is 20" to 30' tall. Its 
saving throw against everything except magi 
cal fire is 5. A wood juggernaut receives no 
saving throw against magical fire attacks. 

STONE J UGGERNAUT: This type of jug 
gernaut appears as a small pyramid or huge 
statue on rollers. It is 40' to 50' tall. Stone 
juggernauts are immune to all non-magi cal 
weapons, and can be damaged only by magi 
cal weapons, spells, or spell-like effects. Its 
saving throw against everything is 4. Stone 
juggernauts can crush small buildings, even 
those made of stone.

A tabi is a small, winged ape-like creature 
about the size of a large houseeat. Its body is 
covered with a long golden fur while its wings 
are leathery membranes, like a bat's. It gives 
off a stench of rot that can be smelled at up to 
100' feet, A tabi is intelligent and clever and 
speaks its own language. 

In combat, a tabi fights with its sharp 
daws, which drip with a crystal-blue venom. 
Anyone hit by a tabi, must make a saving 
throw vs. Paralysis. A character who fails to 
save will be deluded, attacking any creature 
or character adjacent to him. A deluded char 
acter can fight only with weapons or bare 
hands, but does so to the best of his ability. 
The delusion lasts 2-12 turns, or until a neu 
tralize poison is cast on the victim, A tabi also 
has a 40% chance to pick pockets, move 
silently, and hide in shadows. Its prefers to 
ambush a character and then hide in shadows 
while the deluded victim attacks others. 

A tabi has a very long lifespan, during 
which it gathers much information about 
ancient legends and forgotten lore. 

It is possible for high level magic-users to 
research a spell that will bind a tabi to his 
service. If the spell is researched and worded 
properly, the tabi remains in service to the 
magic-user until one or the other dies. While 
enspelled, the tabi is absolutely loyal to the 
character commanding it. In such cases, the 
Morale in parenthesis should be used. An 
enspelled tabi also assists its master by telling 
information that it knows.

The origin of The Master is shrouded in 
mystery. He is believed to be incredibly 
ancient* There is evidence that he has pro 
longed his life by stealing bodies from others 
and transferring his life force into them. 

The tribes of the desert and the people of 
the theocracy of Hole worship The Master as 
a god, and gladly follow him, even to their 
deaths. 

The Master has long sought world domi 
nation, first for its own sake (as chronicled in 
X4 and X5), and more recently as part of a 
search for Immortality in the Sphere of 
Entropy, a mysterious concept not readily 
understood. 

The Master is very confident, sometimes 
to his detriment, and is prone to gloating. He 
is close to no one except his chief henchman, 
Alrcthus the Wizard. 

The Master is sometimes known as Hosa- 
dus. It is not known whether Hosadus is his 
real name. 

Natural abilities give him +2 to his hit roll 
and damage (already figured above), + 3 on 
saving throws against magical attacks, and -2 
on his Armor Class (also figured above). 

He has the following magic items: staff of 


All spells and magic items marked with an 
asterisk (*) are described in the D&D(r) Com 
panion Set. Use the following descriptions if 
you do not own the D&D(r) Companion Set. 

Staff ol Harming : The staff of harming func 
tions similarly to a reversed staff of healing, 
but at the cost of 1 charge per creature 
harmed. It inflicts 2-7 points of damage if it 
touches any creature (no saving throw); a 
normal hit roll may be required. This is in 
addition to normal weapon damage (1-6 
points), if applicable. The staff can also cre 
ate the following effects, with the costs noted. 
Each effect is identical to the reversed form of 
a cleric spell. Note that the use of this staffis a 
Chaotic act. The Master's staff has 20 
charges. 

Staff of Harming Table 

Cause blindness 2 charges 

Cause disease 2 charges 

Cause serious wounds 3 charges 

Create poison 4 charges 

Shield of Energy Drain + 2: This appears to 
be a normal shield + 2 . If the proper com 
mand w'ord is spoken, the shield can be 
charged. If the shield's user is hit while 
"charged," the attacker must make a saving 
throw vs. Rod/Staff/Spell or lose 1 level, as if 
hit by a wight. This special property of the 
shield is usable once per day, and lasts until it 
drains a level . Use of this shield is a Chaotic 
act. 


Aerial Servant : Range 60*; duration 1 day 
per level of the caster; effect, servant fetches 
one item or creature. 

An aerial servant is a very intelligent 
humanoid being from the Ethereal Plane. 
With this spell, the cleric summons one of 
these beings, which appears immediately. 
The cleric must then describe one creature or 
item to the servant, or else it will depart. The 
approximate location of the target must also 
be named. When it hears this description and 
location, the servant leaves to find the item or 
creature and bring it to the cleric. The ser 
vant will take as much time as needed, up to 
the limit of the duration* 

The aerial servant has 18 Strength, and 
can carry up to 5,000 cm It can become ethe 
real at w r ill, and thus can travel to most places 
easily. However, it cannot pass a protection 
from evil spell effect. If it cannot perform its 
duty within the duration of the spell, the ser 
vant becomes insane and returns to attack the 
caster. 

Barrier. Range 60*; duration 12 turns; effect, 
creates whirling hammers. 

This spell creates a magical barrier in an 
area up to 30* in diameter and 30* high. The 
barrier is a wall of whirling and dancing ham 
mers, obviously dangerous. Any creature 
passing through the barrier takes 7-70 points 
of damage from the hammers (no saving 
throw). This spell is often used to block an 
entrance or passage. 

Fhe reverse of this spell (remove barrier) 
destroys any one barrier created by a cleric. It 
can also be used to destroy a magic-useris 
wall of ice, wall of fire , or wall of stone spell 
effect. It will not affect a wall of iron. 

Earthquake : Range 120 yards; duration 1 
turn; effect, causes earth tremors. 

This powerful spell causes a section of 
earth to shake, and opens large cracks in the 
ground. A 1 7th level caster can affect an area 
up to 60' square, adding 5' to each dimen 
sion with each level of experience thereafter. 
A 30th level caster can affect an area up to 
125* square. 

Within the area of effect, all small dwell 
ings are reduced to rubble, and larger con 
structions are cracked open. Earthen 
formations (hills, cliffsides) form rocks!ides. 
Cracks in the earth may open and engulf 1 
creature in 6 (determined randomly), crush 
ing them. 

Holy Word : Range 0; duration instantane 
ous; effect, all creatures within 40 

This spell affects all creatures, friend or 
foe, within a circular area of 40' radius, cen- 


41 













tered on the caster. When the cleric casts this 
spell, all creatures of alignment other than 
the cleric's are affected as follows: 

Up to 5th level: Killed 
Levels 6-8: Stunned 2-20 turns 
Levels 9-12: Deafened 1-6 turns 
Levels 13 + : Stunned 1-10 rounds 


Any victim of 13 levels or more or of the 
same alignment as the caster, may make a 
saving throw vs. Spells to avoid the effect 
entirely. 

This powerful spell cannot be blocked by 
stone, nor by any other solid material except 
lead. It can be blocked by an anti-magic shell. 


Life Drain : Range touch; duration perma 
nent; effect, drains one level. 

This spell drains one level of experience 
from the victim touched, just as if touched by 
a wight or wraith. The casting of this spell is a 
Chaotic act.

Alrethus has been the second-in-command 
and personal assistant to The Master for 
many years. He is not blessed with The Mas 
ter's strange longevity, but has perpetuated 
his life far beyond the norm by using his 
magic jar ability to capture bodies of people 


younger than he is. His own body is incredi 
bly ancient in appearance. If he captures 
young, strong adventurers, he may decide to 
take over the best body by means of a magic 
jar spell. 

Currently, he runs the day-to-day opera 
tions of the Great War. He is extremely intel 
ligent, and a capable manager, but does not 
have the spark of charismatic leadership that 
makes The Master so formidable. While The 
Master is alive, Alrethus is loyal to him unto 
death. But if The Master should die, Alre 
thus flees to protect himself. 

Natural abilities give him a +2 bonus to 
Armor Class (already figured in). Alrethus 
has the following magic items: wand ofpara- 
lyzation, ring of protection + 5, potion of 
polymorph self, ring of spell turning t staff of 
wizardry, and a dagger + 2, +3 vs. elves, 
dwarves, and halflings. A spell book contain 
ing the following spells is hidden in a secret 
compartment underneath the dining table in 
The Master's tent, and cannot be found 
unless the PCs specifically search for secret 
doors there. He has the following spells mem 
orized: 

Level 1: charm person , detect magic, magic 
missile, read magic, shield, sleep 
Level 2: continual light, detect invisible, 
ESP, invisibility, phantasma/ force

All spells marked with an asterisk (*) are 
described in the D&D(r) Companion Set, Use 
the following descriptions if you do not own 
the D&D(r) Companion Set. 

Mass Invisibility. Range 240'; duration per 
manent until broken; effect, many creatures 
or objects. 

This spell bestows invisibility (as the 2nd 
level spell) on several creatures. All the recip 
ients must be within an area 60' square and 
within 240' of the magic-user. The spell will 
affect up to 6 dragon-sized creatures, or up to 
300 man- sized creatures (treating one horse 
as 2 men). After the spell is cast, each crea 
ture becomes invisible, along with all equip 
ment carried. 


Power Word Stum Range 120'; duration 2- 
12 or 1-6 turns; effect, stuns 1 creature with 
70 hit points or less. 

This spell enables the caster to stun one 
victim within 120' (no saving throw). A vic 
tim with 1-35 hit points is stunned for 2-12 
rounds; one with 36-70 hit points is stunned 
for 1-6 rounds. Any creature with 71 or more 
hit points cannot be affected. A stunned vic 
tim is unable to attack or cast spells, and suf 
fers a -4 penalty on all saving throws for the 
duration of the spell. 

Dance : Range touch; duration 3 or more 
rounds; effect, causes 1 victim to dance. 

This spell causes one victim to prance 
madly about, performing a jig or other 
dance, for 3 or more rounds. The victim gets 
no saving throw, and cannot attack, use 
spells or spell-like abilities, or flee. While 
dancing, a -4 penalty applies to the victim's 
saving throws, and a +4 penalty to Armor 
Class as well. 

The magic-user must touch the victim for 
the spell to take effect (a normal hit roll). The 
duration is 3 rounds for a caster of 18th to 
20th level. 

Mass Charm: Range 120'; duration special 
(as charm person spell); effect, 30 levels of 
creatures. 

This spell creates the same effect as a 
charm person or charm monster spell, except 
that 30 levels (or Hit Dice) of victims may be 
affected at once. Each victim may make a 
saving throw vs. Spells to avoid the charm, 
but with a -2 penalty to the roll. The spell 
does not affect a creature of 31 or more levels 
or Hit Dice. 

The duration of each charm is determined 
by the victim's Intelligence (see the D&D(r) 
Basic Dungeon Master Rulebook, page 14). 
If the magic-user attacks one of the charmed 
victims, only that creature's charm is auto 
matically broken. Any other charmed crea 
tures that see the attack may make another 
saving throw, but charmed creatures that do 
not see the attack are not entitled to make 
another saving throw.
