PREROLLED CHARACTERS 


If your players do not have high-level characters, they may use 
the prerolled characters given below. Each description 
includes notes on background, but you should encourage the 
players to add personality details to these descriptions. 

Only the bare minimum of equipment and armor has been 
listed for these characters. Make sure that each of these charac 
ters has the following: 

* 200,000 gp in gems, jewelry, or coins 

* 4-9 potions 

* 1-2 magical rings 

* 1-2 miscellaneous magical items 

* 1-4 loyal henchmen, if the player wants 


When necessary, use dice to determine how many of the above 
items a character has. To determine which items a character 
has, you may roll randomly on any of the lists in the D&D(r) 
Basic, Expert, or Companion rules. If, however, you use only 
the Companion lists, reroll all results that would give the char 
acters items found only in the Companion rules. Give these 
items out during the course of play. 

Even though these characters come from different parts of the 
world, you may tell the players that these characters have 
adventured together in the past, or that they have met and 
become acquainted on the journey to Norwold.

Fergus is a wandering warrior from 
the kingdom of Yestland. He has 
traveled most of the civilized lands, 
and has made a substantial fortune. 
Fergus recently won a major tourna 
ment in Norrvik. It was there that he 
heard of the new kingdom of 
Norwold and decided to move north 
to see what the fuss was about.

Quillan is an accomplished elf from 
the Forest of Alfheim. The restless, 
adventurous elf has come to 
Norwold in search of excitement. 
Knowing that there are many elves 
in that land's northern forests, he 
intends to meet and get to know this 
folk. Quillan hopes to form a niche 
for himself in the Norwold's elven 
society. He does enjoy the rambunc 
tious company and rowdy good 
humor of humans, however, so he 
does his best to keep up contacts with 
his human comrades.

Geoffrey has spent most of his career 
helping the poor and sick in his 
native land of the Heldann Free 
holds. As he developed in both repu 
tation and power, Geoffrey was 
challenged more and more often by 
forces of evil that had tracked him 
down. Since a number of lower level 
clerics are studying now in Heldann, 
Geoffrey has left his ancestral home 
in order to spare it the scourge of the 
evil that follows him. He hopes that 
in the new land of Norwold he will 
be free to begin a new life.

Brogahn is an imposing figure. He 
has broad shoulders, a scowling 
face, and a huge black beard. Being 
one of the most accomplished war 
riors of the Ethengar Khanate, Bro 
gahn had begun to seem like a threat 
to that warlike nation's ruling coun 
cil. Brogahn decided that his future 
lie elsewhere, so he has come to 
Norwold in search of whatever that 
land has to offer.

Weston the Tall is a well-traveled 
adventurer. He has seen most of the 
cities and lands in the civilized 
world. He usually arrives in a new 
area with a full purse and high 
expectations, only to leave a month 
or two later, just ahead of a pack of 
city guards and irate merchants. So 
far, Weston has managed to stay two 
steps ahead of those who would do 
him harm. Weston has decided to 
take the profits made from many 
years of living dangerously and set 
tle down. He wants to try his hand at 
running a dominion.

Claransa has spent much time 
studying magic in the scholarly halls 
of Specularum. She has adventured 
in the Grand Duchy of Karameikos, 
but has seen little of the rest of the 
world. Nevertheless, her exploits in 
Karameikos have earned her a repu 
tation as a steadfast comrade and 
knowledgeable wizard.

PROLOGUE: HOW TO RUN THIS ADVENTURE 


With the fall of the Black Eagle Barony and 
its allied forces, the settled lands of the conti 
nent are now peaceful. Most of the land's 
dungeons have been plundered, and mon 
sters have been driven from all but a few of 
the civilized dominions. Prosperity reigns 
throughout the land now, which is just how 
the rulers want it. The government is stable, 
and day-to-day life is routine. Prospects for 
adventure, however, are minimal. 

Then comes word from the north: the 
empire of Alphatia has claimed the vast lands 
of Norwold, and has appointed a king to rule 
over those lands. This monarch is in need of 
steadfast characters to administer the many 
dominions that may be carved from the wil 
derness of Norwold! 

TEST OF THE WARLORDS is a campaign 
adventure designed for use with the D&D(r) 
Companion Set rules. Two to ten player char 
acters of level 15 or higher may participate in 
the "land grab" as Norwold is partitioned 
into dominions. For those characters who do 
not wish to claim a dominion for themselves, 
plenty of other adventures await in the fledg 
ling states of the new kingdom, as Alphatia is 
not the only empire casting a covetous eye 
toward the potentially wealthy lands of 
Norwold. Secret emissaries have arrived 
from the southern lands of Thyatis, and are 
moving among the folk of Norwold, gaining a 
sizable following of their own. 

The fate of this sprawling land, and of the 
people who make it their home, will be 
decided by those who succeed at the Test of 
the Warlords. 


What is a campaign adventure? 

This adventure may be a little different from 
others you and your players have used. Test 
of the Warlords does not concentrate on a sin 
gle scenario. Rather, this adventure should 
serve as a framework for a D&D(r) Compan 
ion-level game. 

Several dungeon and wilderness encoun 
ters are featured in this adventure, but much 
of the adventure's development depends on 
the characters' actions, such as claiming 
dominions, establishing strongholds, and 
interacting with other characters and non 
player characters. 

If you run only the encounters detailed in 
the Norwold Encounters section, this adven 
ture should last 5 to7 game sessions. If, how 
ever, you use this adventure to develop a 
campaign in which characters may claim 


dominions, the adventure should provide 
enough excitement to last 12 to 15 game ses 
sions. 

No less than an entire kingdom is at stake 
in this adventure. Although Norwold is little 
more than wilderness when the adventure 
begins, its value becomes apparent when 
explorers return to tell of its sheer vastness 
and its valuable natural resources. The wide 
open spaces of Norwold become even more 
valuable as the population of the civilized 
lands to the south explodes. 

Characters in this adventure compete with 
several high-level NPCs, who are also inter 
ested in claiming dominions in Norwold. As 
choice pieces of land are taken, much of the 
adventure's conflict should come from the 
interaction between the characters and these 
NPCs. 

Several events and encounters occur dur 
ing this adventure's time frame. Some of 
these events require characters to work 
together to reach a common goal or defeat a 
common enemy. Of course, this strange, new 
land is home to more than a few monsters! 

Finally, characters must help to determine 
the very fate of Norwold. If characters claim 
dominions in Norwold, they must swear 
fealty to the land's king, who has been 
appointed by the empire of Alphatia. To the 
south, the empire of Thyatis plots to take the 
rich lands of Norwold for itself. Thus, the 
mighty forces of two great empires are drawn 
together in a bloody war to determine who 
will rule Norwold. 

How to use this adventure 

This adventure is divided into several major 
sections. Unlike most adventures, you can 
not simply progress from one section to the 
next as the characters run the course of the 
adventure. Each section contains important 
information that should be used throughout 
the various events and encounters. Also, you 
may use the settings and characters in this 
adventure to expand your D&D* campaign 
world. 

Adventure sections 

The setting: This section outlines the lands 
of Norwold, its terrain types, climate, eco 
nomics, and major cities. This section also 
details the empires of Alphatia and Thyatis, 
and explains the nature of the empires' rela 
tions. 

Nonplayer characters: This section details 
the adventure's major nonplayer characters. 
Statistics and a brief personality profile are 
given for each. 

Land grab: This section outlines how you 


may bring the characters into the campaign. 
Details on how to set up character dominions 
are also given. 

Major events: This section describes two 
major events that take place in Norwold dur 
ing the adventure. 

Norwold encounters: This section outlines 
five major scenarios that may take place dur 
ing the adventure. 

War of the crown: This section lists the 
war machine statistics for all forces involved 
in the war for control of Norwold. Major 
events of the war and key strategies are also 
given. 

Epilogue: This section lists possible sce 
narios for continuing your campaign in 
Norwold. A list of random encounters is also 
included. 

Adventure maps 

Players' Map: Norwold is shown on the 
inside booklet cover. Show this map to the 
players when their characters begin claiming 
their dominions. You may draw the charac 
ters' dominions on this map, but be sure to 
use pencil. The borders could change for any 
number of reasons! 

DM Map 1: World Area shows the rela 
tionship of the empire of Alphatia to the 
empire of Thyatis. If you compare this map 
to the large area map in the D&D(r) Compan 
ion rules, you will be able to place the two 
empires into their proper positions relative to 
the maps provided in the D&D(r) Expert rules. 

DM Map 2: Norwold is your copy of the 
players' map of Norwold. This map shows 
areas that the characters may learn about 
only by exploring. 

DM Maps 3-5 coincide with three of the 
Norwold encounters. 

A blank hex-grid sheet is also provided on 
p. 32 of this booklet. Make photocopies of 
this page and give each player several copies. 
Each player should map out his character's 
dominion on these sheets. You may also want 
to use extra hex-grid sheets to make detailed 
maps of Norwold where specific battles are 
taking place.

PROLOGUE 


Player characters 

This adventure is designed so that you may 
run virtually any number of characters 
through its encounters and events. You may 
have a great deal of trouble running one char 
acter through the adventure, although it is 
possible. Running 10 to 15 characters might 
prove difficult as well. Ideally, you should try 
to have from three to eight characters for this 
adventure. 

A list of eight prerolled Companion (high) 
level characters is provided on the outside 
booklet cover. Your players do not have to use 
these characters if they don't want to. They 
are given as options for players whose charac 
ter level is not yet high enough for a Compan 
ion level adventure, or for players whose 
characters may have had an "unfortunate 
accident." 

If you have a small number of player char 


acters for this adventure, you should use at 
least one of the prerolled characters as an 
NPC aligned with the characters. 

Random encounters 

A list of random encounters that might occur 
at different points during the adventure is 
given on p. 31. Obviously, checking once per 
hour or even several times per day would be 
inappropriate for this type of campaign 
adventure. 

The timing of the random encounters is left 
entirely up to you, based on your sense of 
drama. If the adventure is moving along rap 
idly, and if the characters are keeping busy, 
you may not need to introduce a random 
encounter for many "months." On the other 
hand, you may wish to inhabit the charac 
ters' dominions with challenging monsters or 
NPCs, or you may wish to throw in a surprise 


for the characters as they make a routine 
journey through some area of Norwold. 

Not all of these encounters need put the 
characters in combat. Characters who have a 
great deal of experience should have some 
appreciation of the value of a good friend, as 
well as a vanquished foe. In these "easy" 
encounters, characters should gain experi 
ence points for establishing alliances or help 
ing those in need (depending, of course, on 
alignment). 

When you decide to use a random encoun 
ter, determine the type of terrain in which the 
encounter will occur. A modified die roll is 
given at the top of the Random Encounters 
Table for each terrain type. Find the die roll 
result and the corresponding encounter on 
the table.

THE SETTING: OUTLINING NORWOLD AND THE EMPIRES 



A large continent lies in the northern hemi 
sphere of the D&D(r) world. The largest single 
region on this continent is Norwold. 

Norwold lies to the north of the land shown 
on p. 33 of the D&D(r) Expert rule book. To 
see how the Expert map relates to Norwold, 
line up the coastline near the bottom left cor 
ner of the map shown on this adventure's 
inside booklet cover with the coastline at the 
top of the Expert map (near the Heldann 
Freeholds). If you want to see more of the 
Expert/Companion world, you may line up 
the players' map with the map shown on p. 
16-17 of adventure XI, "The Isle of Dread." 


Competing empires 

Two major empires are competing for power 
in Norwold. The empire of Alphatia has 
already established a kingdom in the area, 
and is actively seeking to develop firm control 
over the region. The empire of Thyatis is 
alarmed by this development, and is deter 
mined to disrupt the expansion of the Alpha- 
tian empire. 

These two empires have come into conflict 
over territory in the past. DM Map 1 shows 
each empire's areas of control. The areas 
where the two empires overlap are currently 
being contested. 

Alphatia background 

Alphatia is the oldest empire in the world. It 
is located on a massive island off the eastern 
coast of Norwold. The empire built its power 
on a solid foundation of magic. No fewer than 
1,000 36th level magic-users make up this 
empire's ruling council. Reliance on magical 
abilities, and complete confidence in the 
overwhelming superiority of these abilities, 
are the hallmarks of Alphatian power. 

King Eric all is the second son of the cur 
rent Empress of Alphatia, Eriadna the Wise. 
Eriadna has granted Ericall all of Norwold as 
his dominion, and has given him the freedom 
to develop and rule the kingdom as he sees fit. 
After a decade or so, Eriadna expects Ericall 
to begin making substantial tax payments 
from Norwold into Alphatia's coffers. 


Thyatis background 

This empire is much younger than Alphatia. 
Actually, it is little more than a century old. 
The empire has spread rapidly outward from 
Thyatis, its capital city. It now encompasses 
several large islands off the southern coast of 
the continent. 

Unlike Alphatia, Thyatis has developed 
upon a triad of powers. The theocratic, magi 
cal, and military elements of the empire all 
share the responsibilities of problem solving 
and policy development. 

Thincol the Brave is currently the emperor 
of Thyatis. He is a 36th level fighter who has 
been known on many occasions to be cruel 
and merciless. He does, however, possess a 
keen soldier's mind that has allowed his 
empire to hold its own against the mighty 
legions of Alphatia. 

Many historians attribute Thyatis' rapid 
growth to its leaders' fabled capacity for 
greed and trickery. Although several of Thy 
atis' territorial battles appear to have been 
fought on the field of honor, many more, his 
torians agree, were won through treachery 
and deceit. 

Relations between the two empires 

Alphatia and Thyatis have rarely met to dis 
cuss their territorial differences. More often, 
the two empires clash in minor wars, fought 
chiefly in outlying areas (the two empires 
consider Norwold an outlying area). Neither 
empire has made a concerted effort to wipe 
the other out, since the resources and risks 
involved in such an undertaking would 
severely restrict the possibility of victory for 
either side. 

Alphatia has won most of the skirmishes 
between the two empires, because of its 
potent magical abilities. Thyatis has, how 
ever, prevailed on occasion. 

Each empire places active spies and agents 
in all of its rival's lands. Agents from the 
empires have even penetrated each other's 
ruling councils. 

Overall, these two empires have achieved a 
delicate balance of power. The weight of this 
balance may gradually shift from decade to 
decade, but it is unlikely that either of the 
empires will be able to destroy its foe for a 
long time to come. 

Norwold terrain types 

A variety of terrain types covers the land of 
Norwold. Most of these types are shown on 
the players' map. Consider unmarked hexes 
to be forest, as this is Norwold's most com 
mon terrain type.

THE SETTING 


Mountains 

Two huge mountain ranges make up the 
spine of the subcontinent. The Final Range 
runs parallel to the southeastern coast of 
Norwold. It is situated about 200 miles 
inland. The range took its name from ancient 
explorers who thought it represented the far 
edge of the world. 

The other range in Norwold is even greater 
than the Final Range. It runs north and south 
along the kingdom's western border. Barbari 
ans and savages refer to it as the Icereach 
Range or White Range, but the new govern 
ment has not officially explored and named 
the range. 

The mountains of Norwold are towering 
pinnacles of rock that dwarf the summits of 
the renowned Altan Tepe Range, which lies 
far to the south. A number of peaks in the 
central regions of the Final Range reach 
18,000 feet above sea level, while at least a 
dozen peaks in the Icereach tower over 
24,000 feet high. 

Many peaks in both ranges are snow-cov 
ered all year long. In the upper reaches of 
both ranges, huge glaciers sprawl outward. 
The ice in these areas has not melted for thou 
sands of years. 

Trees grow in the lower mountain valleys 
as far north as the Great Bay. Mountainous 
areas north of the bay are barren of trees. No 
trees grow at altitudes higher than 8,000 feet. 

Where a mountain hex on the players' map 
is adjacent to a clear hex, assume that half of 
the mountain hex is made up of "foothills" - 
long, gradually rising ridges of rock that lead 
to the mountains. 

Hills 

Dense forests cover most of the hilly areas in 
Norwold. Pines and other evergreens are the 
predominant forms of trees. Lakes and clear 
ings dot the hills, and flowers and herbs are 
common in the thick meadows. 

Bogs and marshes fill some of the low spots 
on the hilly terrain. If characters drain these 
areas, they have ideal farmland. Any druids 
in the area take grave exception to such eco 
logical tampering, however! 

Marshes 

These areas are simply wet lowlands, and are 
unsuitable for development. No permanent 
structures could stand in these areas. There is 
a 20% chance, however, that a marsh hex 
contains small areas of higher ground large 
enough to hold a small village. Nevertheless, 
marsh areas are definitely not prime real 
estate. 

The nearby rivers and lakes flood the 


5 










THE SETTING 


marsh areas each spring, covering all but the 
highest ground in 2-8 feet of water. The 
marshes freeze in winter, and characters may 
cross them during this time. Consider all fro 
zen marshes as plains. 

Forests 

Forests cover most of the land in Norwold. 
Evergreens are the only types of trees that 
grow in the northern forests, while broad 
stretches of oak, hickory, maple, elm, ash, 
fruit, and other hardwood trees mix with the 
evergreens in the southern forests. 

Many different types of woodlands may be 
found in a single forest hex. In many places, 
old and giant trees stretch toward the sun. 
These trees are incredibly wide, and stand 
several yards apart. The underbrush in these 
areas is sparse, so characters may travel 
through the areas easily. In other areas, the 
trees are younger and weaker. They do not 
screen sunlight from the forest floor, so the 
underbrush in these areas is dense. Travel 
through these areas is difficult. You may 
alternate between the two types of forest ter 
rain, depending on the pace of the adventure. 
When characters move through thick under 
brush, you may cut their movement rate in 
half. 

Several meadows may break the growth in 
a forest hex. These meadows may actually 
seem more like prairies, since some of them 
stretch for 5-10 miles. 

Gently rolling dirt makes up much of the 
land in these forest areas. Low hills are fairly 
common. 

Tundra 

This flat, wet land exists only at the extreme 
northern end of Norwold. The tundra is a 
region of terrifyingly severe winters and 
soggy, muddy summers. 

Herds of grazing animals cross the tundra 
during the pleasant months, stalked by an 
occasional predator. All but the cold-loving 
creatures abandon the tundra in winter, how 
ever. 

During the summer, 10-40% (Id4xl0) of a 
tundra hex is covered by ponds, and wide, 
shallow lakes. Fish are not common in these 
bodies of water, but huge swarms of insects 
usually are. 

Rivers 

Only the largest of Norwold's many rivers are 
shown on the players' map. Those rivers that 
are shown may be 1-4 miles wide at any given 
spot. For the most part, these rivers are too 
deep for wading. 

Assume that at least one river (50-200 feet 


wide) and several streams drain each hex on 
the map. 

Feel free to add to the waterways marked 
on the Norwold maps. Rivers may make use 
ful boundaries when characters establish or 
contest the size of their dominions. 

Lakes 

As with rivers, only the major lakes are 
shown on the Norwold maps. Since so much 
of the land of Norwold is wooded and rainy, 
small lakes dot much of the land (at least one 
per hex in the south, as many as a dozen per 
hex in the north). 

All of the inland lakes are freshwater lakes. 
The mountain lakes are very deep, while the 
flatland lakes are shallow. 



Norwold climate 

Norwold is a northern temperate region hav 
ing four distinct seasons. Each of these sea 
sons lasts approximately three months. 
Seasons in the southern part of Norwold are 
less severe than the seasons in the north. 

Precipitation is common in Norwold, and 
comes in the form of snow in winter, and rain 
in summer. During the spring and fall, the 
precipitation may come as either rain or snow 
(50% chance, modified plus or minus 30% 
based on the location of the specific region, 
and the time of the season-late spring, late 
fall, etc.). 

Some form of precipitation falls every four 
days. Of course, a thunderstorm or snow 
storm may last much longer than one day. 
Also, a dry spell might last for weeks. Use the 
four-day figure as a rough average when you 


run your campaign. You may want to use 
severe weather (torrential rains, droughts) as 
plot twists. 

Trade routes and resources 

DM Map 2 shows several Norwold trade 
routes. Characters may discover and mark 
these routes on their own map, but they 
should not be aware of these routes at the 
start of the adventure. 

The only civilized areas in Norwold when 
the adventure begins are Alpha and the five 
hexes that surround that city; the demi- 
human strongholds; Landfall; Oceansend, 
and the coastal hexes on each side of that port 
city. 

Dominion resources are explained in detail 
in the Companion rules, although some sug 
gestions for calculating resources are given 
below: 

Most mountain resources are mineral in 
nature. 

The most common mineral resources in 
hilly areas are tar, clay, coal, and stone. 

Besides the obvious wood and timber 
resources in forest areas, the main resources 
in these areas are animal or vegetable in nat 
ure. 

Tundra areas have only a 30% chance of 
holding a resource. A tundra hex never holds 
more than one resource, and that resource is 
never animal in nature. 

Norwold cities 

Alpha, the king's city 

This sprawling community numbers some 
30,000 residents. More than 60,000 farmers 
live and work in the civilized regions nearby. 

Blessed with a splendid deep-water port, 
Alpha boasts a bustling waterfront. Ships 
carrying imports from other parts of the con 
tinent, as well as from the empire ofAlphatia, 
arrive at least once per day. Ships carrying 
goods from all of Norwold sail from this port 
almost as frequently. A large fishing industry 
based here provides food for much of the city 
and jobs for many of those living on the 
waterfront. 

The farms that surround Alpha are very 
prosperous. The soil, deposited by a glacier, 
is rich loam, and the farmers are a hardy, 
industrious folk. Many of them have lived on 
and farmed this land for generations. As a 
group, the farmers have welcomed the arrival 
of King Ericall and are happy to be members 
of an established form of government. 

Alpha was erected on the ruins of an 
ancient fortress, utilizing some of the old for 
tifications in its construction. All areas of the 


6 




THE SETTING 


city are heavily fortified. Up to 10,000 people 
may take shelter in the fortress, which still 
allows access to the harbor. Walls surround 
the entire city and represent a formidable 
obstacle to any foe. 

King Eric all's palace stands on a hill in the 
center of the fortified zone. Although foun 
tains and gardens adorn the structure, the 
palace's high, thick walls, and numerous tow 
ers give testimony to the fact that its main 
purpose is defense. 

The palace covers a huge area of Alpha. It 
is made up of dozens of buildings, all located 
inside the wall. Fireplaces are common in all 
of the buildings, making the palace comfort 
ably warm even in the dead of winter. Hun 
dreds of guestrooms, and dozens of kitchens 
and dining rooms ensure that many visitors 
can be comfortably attended to at one time. 

Funds from the empire of Alphatia helped 
pay for the palace, which took 10 years to 
build. The palace's Grand Ballroom is con 
sidered one of the masterpieces of architec 
ture in the civilized world. 

The peninsula on which Alpha is located is 
cut off from the rest of Norwold at its neck by 
a rugged stretch of mountains. This pass, 
known as Regent Pass, is the only gap 
through these mountains. A small garrison of 
500 of the king's guards stands watch over 
this pass. 

Landfall, pirate's haven 

This dirty city is little more than a collection 
of squalid huts and sleazy dives. Somehow, 
10,000 people survive in these filthy sur 
roundings. If characters are looking for an 
item or person of seedy nature, chances are 
they can find it here. 

King Ericall has already appointed Fernal 
the Swill, his demented half-brother, as lord 
of this dominion (see the Nonplayer Charac 
ters section for a description of this wretched 
gentleman). Fernal pays the king 40% of all 
of his tax income, so Ericall allows Fernal to 
rule this vile place with a fairly free hand. Eri 
call does not know that Fernal reports less 
than half of his tax earnings. 

Fandfall is often a port of call for ships 
journeying north to Alpha, so there is a 
chance that the characters stop here before 
they see much else of Norwold. This first 
impression should be a strong one. 

The dirty, ramshackle docks of Fandfall 
mar the shore of a once placid bay. Screams 
and cries ring through the streets frequently, 
attracting little notice other than the occa 
sional turned head. 

The Thieves' Guild is the true ruler of 
Fandfall, and any thieves who would practice 
their craft here must deal with the Guild very 
soon after arriving. 


There is a 10% chance per turn that any 
stranger visiting Fandfall is robbed. The thief 
would be the same level as his victim, and he 
tries to take as much as he can. Once a visitor 
is cleaned out, or once he has foiled three rob 
bery attempts, the thieves leave that visitor 
alone. 

Fandfall's defenses are woefully inade 
quate. Fernal lives in a large, poorly built 
wood mansion, and the rest of the city is 
devoid of any stone buildings or fortresses. If 
a military force threatens Fandfall, most peo 
ple react by setting sail for the open seas or 
running for the hills. 

Poor farms and small villages are scattered 
throughout the land that surrounds the city. 
Old sailors inhabit most of these villages. 
Many of the other settlers are outlaws hiding 
from the justice of more civilized parts of the 
world. 

Oceansend, free city 

This heavily fortified community has not yet 
agreed to join in declaring allegiance to King 
Ericall. Oceansend is a thriving, vibrant city 
that is much older than either Alpha or Fand 
fall. Its people are generally wiser in the ways 
of dominions, and are reluctant to join any 
newly created kingdoms. 

Nearly 20,000 people live in Oceansend. 
Demi-humans make up a large proportion of 
the population. There are at least 3,000 
dwarves, 2,000 halflings, and 500 elves living 
within the city walls. All of the inhabitants 
are very loyal to the ruler of the city, King 
Yarrvik the Just (see the Nonplayer Charac 
ters section for a description of this king). 
Anyone who tries to subvert the city's ruling 
structure is likely to incite a riot in support of 
the king and his family. 

Another 20,000 people live in the country 
side that surrounds Oceansend. Most of these 
people live on prosperous farms or in small 
villages within 50 miles or so of the city. Each 
of these villages keeps a well-trained militia 
(troop class: good). These villagers are very 
loyal to the Oceansend government. 

Well-traveled trade routes lead west from 
Oceansend to some branches of the Final 
Range. Small dwarven communities near the 
mountains trade metal items for the produce 
and imported goods from Oceansend. A 
staunch alliance exists between the mountain 
dwarves and the city. If invaders attack either 
area, the one group invariably comes to the 
defense of the other. The dwarves can muster 
some 1,000 troops. The city can call up 
around 6,000 troops. 

Consider the entire city of Oceansend a 
fortress. Even if attackers invade the city by 
land, Oceansend residents would still have 


access to their docks, and since the residents 
could live on seafood almost indefinitely, an 
attack by land would have little chance of suc- 

Special geographical features 

Arch of fire 

Two volcanoes are located near the Icereach 
Range. They stand 75 miles apart. A unique 
phenomenon connects the two volcanoes: the 
northern volcano is an inflowing vortex from 
the plane of fire, and the southern volcano is 
an outflowing vortex to the same plane. 
Thus, the two volcanoes form a towering 
"arch of fire" that flows from the north vol 
cano to the south volcano. 

The arch of fire is visible up to 72 miles 
away (3 hexes) at night, and up to 48 miles 
away by day. The arch reaches a height of 6 
miles in its center, and forms a tube roughly 
300 feet in diameter. 

The hexes containing the two volcanoes 
are true wastelands of fire. The land that sur 
rounds each of the volcanoes is relatively flat, 
and is crisscrossed by flowing rivers of lava. 
Huge lakes of fire lie at the bases of the volca 
noes. 

Many small cave mouths dot the rocks that 
surround the mountains. Although most of 
these openings lead nowhere, some do con 
nect to fissures deep within the earth. Rush 
ing gouts of steam occasionally scald these 
caves. Fire giants, red dragons, and a host of 
other heat-loving creatures occupy many of 
the caves. 

The most fearsome residents of these val 
leys of lava are the huge bands of fire elemen 
tal. The elementals spend a great deal of 
time on this portion of the prime material 
plane, because it reminds them so much of 
their natural habitat. If the elementals 
encounter characters in these areas, they 
either slay the characters immediately, or 
they carry them off to the plane of fire for an 
uncomfortably warm period of imprison 
ment. The elementals do take care to see that 
their prisoners are protected from some of the 
more extreme features of their environment, 
however. 

Wormholes lead out of many of the caves in 
these areas, and empty into the vortexes that 
flow into and out of the plane of fire. All of the 
fire elementals' caves feature these worm- 
holes. 

Whirlpool 

This churning mass of water fills an entire 
hex in a bay along the northern shores of 
Norwold. The water surface in the bay is 
choppy and unpredictable. A strong current 


7 




THE SETTING 


(90 feet per turn) pulls toward the whirlpool, 
which is in the center of the bay. 

The whirlpool is actually an elemental vor 
tex that flows from the prime material plane 
to the plane of water. The whirlpool spirals 
downward until the water reaches the vor 
tex-about 200 feet below the surface-and 
then flows out of the prime material plane in a 
foaming rush. 

Several water elementals live in the bay, 
and are accompanied, in winter, by the occa 
sional hydrax. Characters who venture onto 
the bay are attacked by a band of water ele 
mentals. The creatures try to abduct the 
characters and carry them to the plane of 
water. 

Clanholds of the small folk 

An "H" on the players' map marks the loca 
tion of a clanhold. Each clanhold shown on 
the map represents a halfling clan. Each of 
the seven communities is different and has its 
own leadership and crucible of black flame. 
The fact that all of the clans are located close 
to each other has encouraged the halfling s to 
develop together, however. 

The stronghold of Leeha is the clans' cen 
tral gathering place. The stronghold is 
located near the White Bear River. The half- 
lings have excavated huge warrens along the 
riverbank, so that the members of all the 
clans may stay in Leeha and have a safe roof 
over their heads and a warm fire before their 
feet. 

Each individual clan numbers from 700 to 
1,200 halflings. A total of6,500 halflings lives 
in the seven communities. The halflings can 
muster a force of 1,500 warriors in times of 
crisis. Although the small folk try not to 
become involved in their human neighbors' 
quarrels, they do not hesitate to band 
together and defend their homeland against 
incursions by monsters and other undesir 
ables. 

The halflings control passage up and down 
the White Bear River, which runs between 
the clanholds. The halflings charge 1-10 gp 
for each vessel that passes. The size of the ves 
sel determines the rate. 

A number of fine inns, large enough to 
accommodate humans, are located in Leeha. 
Without exception, these inns are high qual 
ity places, filled with warm food and good 
cheer. 

Frosthaven 

A huge clan of frost giants lives on this barren 
island of rocks and ice. Because the island lies 
so far north, no plants other than mosses and 
fungi grow on the island. Icy winds and bliz 
zards sweep Frosthaven three seasons of the 


year. Characters would find this an extremely 
dangerous place in which to live. 

The frost giants are right at home, how 
ever. They live in a number of huge caverns, 
which are carved into the ice of the living gla 
ciers. A complicated series of ice tunnels con 
nects most of these caves. Some 6,000 frost 
giants live on the island; 2,000 of them are 
warlike males. 

In the dead of winter, ice connects Fros 
thaven to the shores of northern Norwold. At 
least once every 5 years, a huge band of frost 
giants crosses this ice to raid Norwold. The 
raiding party usually includes 2,000 giants; 
the giants split up into smaller groups if they 
do not meet resistance. Once the giants have 
crossed the ice, they spend most of the winter 
raiding various areas of Norwold. They usu 
ally go no further south than the Great Bay, 
and they try to cross the ice back to Fros 
thaven by early spring. 

The frost giants' vast treasure horde lies 
deep in the passages of the mightiest glacier 
in Frosthaven. You may arrange to have 
characters hear tales of the giants' great 
wealth. If the characters search for the trea 
sure, they must pass numerous caves full of 
giants, as well as hundreds of the giants' pets 
(polar bears and wolves), to reach the giants' 
treasure vault. The vault holds at least 4 mil 
lion gp in coins, gems, and jewelry. 

Wyrmsteeth range 

This mountain range lies to the northeast of 
the Final Range. No civilized beings live 
there, because it is the home of nearly 1,000 
dragons. The range is named for the appear 
ance of the peaks. If characters view the 
range from the horizon, they see that the 
main ridges look like the lower jaw of a drag 
on's mouth, and that the towering pinnacles 
of rock closely resemble a serpent's drooling 
fangs. 

The lord of the Wyrmsteeth is a huge red 
dragon (HD 23, hp 160) of unknown age. 
Huge and large dragons of all colors (except 
gold) are common in the range, and hun 
dreds of the "small" types make their home 
here. 

Because the lord is extremely smart, it does 
not lead the dragons on massive raids into the 
civilized lands of Norwold, plundering and 
destroying everything in sight. Rather, the 
lord leads the dragons on short forays, often 
flying far from the Wyrmsteeth Range before 
striking, so that the people of Norwold do not 
become aware of the high concentration of 
serpents in the range. Norwold settlers have 
always known that some dragons live in the 
range, but most nearby residents would esti 
mate the total number at no more than 100. 


Nearly all of the caves in the Wyrmsteeth 
Range are dragon lairs. A large cavern might 
be the home to as many as 20 serpents. Trea 
sures are also plentiful in these caves. It's safe 
to say that, somewhere in the Wyrmsteeth 
Range, characters could find at least one of 
every magic item and type of treasure listed 
in the D&D(r) Basic, Expert, and Companion 
rules. Small dragons have unusually small 
treasures, however, since their huge and large 
brethren get most of the good stuff. To deter 
mine how much treasure a small dragon has, 
divide in half the amount given in the Com 
panion rules for large dragons. 

Foresthomes 

Several dozen elven communities (known by 
various explorers as "Foresthomes") thrive 
in the forests of Norwold. Neither the king 
nor his agents are aware of these communi 
ties, so they are not marked on the map. You 
may place an elven village wherever you 
wish, as long as it fits in with the surrounding 
terrain. 

Each of the communities is home to 200- 
1,200 elves. When necessary, each commu 
nity can call up a fourth of its members to 
form a military force. Elves are usually not 
pleased to see more humans arriving in their 
area, but they are wise enough to see that 
using force to resist the humans would be 
futile. The elves do not become involved in 
wars between humans, but they do lend their 
support when the enemy is an invading band 
of monsters or other evil creatures. 

Most of the elven communities exist in 
areas where the trees are a mixture of ever 
greens and hardwoods. Some elves build 
structures in the tall branches of the hard 
woods, while others construct isolated niches 
among the lush pines. The elves then build 
bridges to connect their tree homes. The few 
meandering paths the elves leave on the 
ground are almost unnoticeable. A Tree of 
Life stands at the center of each of these com 
munities. 

The elven agriculture consists mainly of a 
few small gardens. The elves are skilled 
hunters, and would rather roam the woods 
for their food. Elves are especially skilled at 
thinning the old and weak animals from the 
herds they hunt. 

Characters may encounter elven hunting 
parties several miles from an elven commu 
nity. Elves have little sense of territory, and 
rarely come into conflict with neighboring 
elven communities.

NONPLAYER CHARACTERS: INTRODUCING KINGS & LORDS 



When the land grab begins in Norwold, the 
characters won't be the only ones requesting 
dominions from the king. Several other high- 
level nonplayer characters also arrive in 
Alpha to meet with the king. 

Twelve new NPCs are described in this sec 
tion. Each description includes statistics, 
weapons, and a brief character background. 

The NPCs in this section are divided into 
two groups: Established Characters and 
Competing Characters. The former includes 
NPCs who already have dominions. Charac 
ters are more likely to interact and ally them 
selves with these characters. The latter 
includes NPCs who are competing with the 
characters for dominions. If you have any 
other NPCs in your campaign that your char 
acters have encountered before, you may 
bring them to Norwold to compete for

King Ericall is a very likable young man. 
He is not yet 30 years old, but the rigorous 
training required of Alphatian royalty 
ensures that he has reached an accom 
plished level of experience. 

Ericall is the second son of Eriadna the 
Wise, Empress of Alphatia. His older 
brother is first in line for the imperial 
throne, so Ericall has been granted 
Norwold as his fief. 

Ericall has very good intentions, and 
wishes to be fair to all. He gets very upset 
when a decision he made hurts people in 
any way. Although he is young, his experi 
ences, together with the responsibilities of 
running a kingdom, are maturing him rap 
idly. Ericall is still uncomfortable with some 
aspects of his occupation, but he does not 
hesitate to carry out actions that he feels are 
proper or necessary. 

Ericall is handsome, rich, and quite eligi 
ble. He will be married during the course of 
events set up in this adventure (see the 
Major Events section). You may have one of 
the female characters in your campaign 


dominions also. Make sure that these NPCs 
are about the same level as your characters. 

Keep in mind that using NPCs is one of the 
best ways to add life to your campaign. 
Including many NPCs helps make the char- 

become Ericall's bride, if you wish. 

The king owns a wide variety of both per 
manent and temporary magic items. He 
uses them only when he feels such use 
would benefit the kingdom in some way. 
Use your discretion in determining what 
types of items Ericall owns. 

If some unfortunate accident should 
befall King Ericall during the campaign, a 
struggle for the throne results. Lernal the 
Swill, King Ericall's half-brother, claims 
that the throne is his, and he tries to raise an 
army to back up his claim. If the king has 
married, his queen has the legal right to the 
throne. If the king has not married, the 
empress of Alphatia sends an heir within 
2d6 months. 

An elite bodyguard of knights protects 
the king at all times. Each of these knights 
has the same statistics:

dominion of Landfall, mainly because it's 
far from Alpha. Lernal is a totally unscru 
pulous and rotten individual. He never tells 
the truth if he can come up with a suitable 
lie. 

Lernal is a puppet of the Thieves Guild. 
He hold power only because he can be eas 
ily bribed. He keeps a scruffy group of 
guards on hand, since there are many who 
wish him ill.

King Yarrvik is a good and just man. He 
rules the city of Oceansend. He is willing to 
come under the wing of the kingdom of 
Norwold, but only ifhe retains his own title. 
King Ericall, however, is not yet willing to 
concede this. Currently, Ericall and Yarrvik 
coexist in uneasy peace. 

King Yarrvik does not side with Ericall in 
the War of the Crown, although he may side 
with Thyatis, if characters' forces attack 
Oceansend (see the War of the Crown sec 
tion, Activating Neutral Forces for details).

Tam Oakleafs spells have not been listed, 
because he may cast virtually any clerical or 
druid spell that he wishes Make sure that if 
Tam engages in extended combat, he does 
not exceed the number of spells allowed for 
any level 


Tam is not the highest level druid in 
Norwold, but King Ericall has chosen him 
to be the druidic representative to his court. 
Tam speaks for the woodlands and the crea 
tures that live there. He counsels the king to 
avoid policies that might prove destructive 
in any way to the forests. 

Tarn is normally calm and passive, but 
on the rare occasions when he does lose his 
temper, people run for cover.

Assume that Madiera knows any spell that 
you want her to cast. Make sure, as with 
Tam Oakleaf, that she doesn't use more 
than the allowed number of spells for any 
level. 

Madiera is one of the sages of Alphatia. 
She is not yet accomplished enough to sit on 
the empire's ruling council, but she is ambi 
tious. Currently, she serves as King Eri- 
call's advisor. She is very conscientious 
about her job. 

Madiera uses a number of magic items in 
her job, including a slate of identification. 
She also has many other items that help her 
obtain information. 


Competing characters 

These NPCs arrive in Alpha in time for the 
spring festival. They have come to request 
dominions from King Ericall. Make sure 
that some of these NPCs request the same 
areas that the characters want (see the Land 
Grab section, Establishing Dominions for 
details).

Choose Alak Dool's spells before he goes 
into direct combat with any character. Alak 
may cast nearly any type of spell (within the 
levels given here). 

Alak Dool is an ambitious man. He is 
well-funded by Thyatian backers. Dool's 
job is to carve out a dominion in Norwold, 
and then secretly report to the Thyatians on 
the kingdom's development. When war 
breaks out, Dool drops his cover and openly 
sides with the Thyatian invaders. The Thy 
atians have promised nearly half of 
Norwold to Dool for this betrayal, so he 
works very hard to see that Thyatis pre 
vails. 

He is, incidentally, an extremely selfish 
and cruel individual.

This good-natured fellow, who was once a 
paladin, has decided to settle down and 
form a dominion. Some people would refer 
to Sir Ernest as a "goody two-shoes." 

A large handlebar mustache splits 
Ernest's face, which is usually sporting a 
broad smile. Ernest's hearty laugh is very 
familiar to all who have met him. Sir Ernest 
is usually doing something "good"- help 
ing a maiden across a muddy spot in the 
road, feeding a lost puppy, or cheerfully tip 
ping a beggar.

Rutger Dag is a wild character from the 
kingdom of Vestland. He has made a good 
fortune adventuring, and now he plans to 
turn his energies toward settling down and 
creating a dominion. He enjoys banquets 
and parties above all other forms of enter 
tainment.

Sandralane is a devout young cleric from 
the Principalities of Glantri. She has grown 
tired of the lack of respect shown her profes 
sion by the mages who control Glantri, so 
she has moved north to form a dominion of 
her own. She intends to make sure that 
proper deference is shown to clerics living in 
her dominion. 

Sandralane is a very pretty woman. She 
has an alluring smile, and a soft, melodious 
voice. Her long hair and her eyes are jet 
black. A hint of mystery always seems to be 
playing on her expression.

Max the First is an ambitious, careful war 
rior who has come to Norwold to start his 


own dynasty. He fully expects that one of 
his descendants will one day rule not only 
all of Norwold, but all of the rest of the con 
tinent as well. 

In open combat, Max seems a bit cow 
ardly. He is certainly unwilling to take any 
undue risks-he is well aware that a dead 
man can father no children! 

Max listens to the pleas of Thyatian 
agents with an eager ear. He sees in the con 
flict between the two empires a chance to 
better his position. When the War of the 
Crown begins, Max commits his forces to 
the empire ofThyatis.

Allisa is a proud warrior from the steppes of 
the Ethengar Khanate. Her short stature 
and petite appearance belie her skill with a 
longbow. She stands less than 5 feet tall, but 
the cool precision of her aim with a bow that 
is longer than she is attests to her remark 
able ability. 

Allisa has come to Norwold on a lark. She 
enjoys a rousing adventure, and if she can 
gain a title and lands in the process, so 
much the better. She is friendly, and she 
takes an oath seriously. Once she pledges 
allegiance to Ericall, she becomes a staunch 
ally.

Longtooth has come to Norwold to set up a 
stronghold for his professional colleagues, 
or so he says. Actually, this smiling, beady- 
eyed thief is the chief agent for the empire of 
Thyatis. He tries to befriend all of the char 
acters at different times, and does his best to 
persuade them to join forces with Thyatis. 

Any character who gets on Longtooth's 
bad side is likely to be visited by a band of 
high-level thieves in the middle of a moon 
less night. Although these thieves are look 
ing primarily for magic items, they do not 
rule out murder, particularly if the charac 
ter has greatly angered or insulted 
Longtooth. 

Longtooth does his best to make sure that 
Thyatian spies infiltrate the castles of all 
lords allied with Alphatia. Even though his 
operation is quite extensive, Longtooth 
does an excellent job of covering his tracks. 
If a character catches a Thyatian spy in his 
home, he has a very difficult time linking 
the spy to Longtooth.

LAND GRAB: BEGINNINGTHE ADVENTURE 



Setting the stage 

Before this adventure can begin, you must 
motivate the characters to move north into 
the lands of Norwold. You may give them the 
following reasons for doing so. 

The opportunities for adventure in the civ 
ilized world (the areas outlined in adventure 
XI, "The Isle of Dread") have dwindled to a 
mere few. The area has become the starting 
point for many young, inexperienced adven 
turers, and there are very few treasures left 
that haven't been plundered. To bring this 
point home, you might have your characters 
spend some time mopping up kobolds and 
goblins, and earning dozens of copper pieces 
for their efforts. 

You should also tell the characters that a 
number of messengers are arriving from 
Norwold, bringing word that the recently 
installed king there needs high level charac 
ters to help rule the vast domain. The mes 
sengers explain that the lands of Norwold are 
located somewhere north of the Heldann 
Freeholds. Tell the characters that other 
accounts place Norwold north and east of 
Ostland and Vestland. 

If the characters are still not interested in 
traveling to Norwold, have personal repre 


sentatives of King Ericall visit the characters. 
These representatives invite the characters to 
Alpha, the king's city. The representatives 
explain that the king has heard many tales of 
the characters' brave adventures, and would 
be honored if they would serve as rulers of 
dominions in Norwold. 

The messengers (or the representatives) 
should also inform the characters of the com 
ing of the spring festival in Norwold. The 
messengers tell the characters that King Eri 
call will likely choose many of his dominion 
rulers at this festival. Make sure the charac 
ters receive word of the festival at least 6 
months in advance, so they may tie up their 
affairs and make travel arrangements, if they 
wish to attend. 

Getting the characters 
to Norwold 

Characters may use any means available to 
travel to Norwold. They may leave on a ship 
to Alpha from any of these port cities: 
Zeaburg, Norrvik, or Soderfjord. If charac 
ters decide to depart from one of these cities, 
they must wait 2d6 days for a ship. Charac 
ters may get to one of these port cities from 
nearly any coastal city shown on the D&D(r) 
Expert continent map. 

The trip takes Id 10+20 days and costs 40 gp 
per character. 

Characters may also charter a ship to 
Alpha from one of the three cities listed 
above. The characters may rent a long ship 
for 2,000 gp. 

The spring festival 

Characters should arrive in Norwold in time 
for the spring festival (around March 21 on 
our calendar). King Ericall has established 
the festival as a celebration of the coming of 
spring to Norwold. The festivities also 
include a tournament, which the king hopes 
to use in evaluating candidates for dominion 
rulers. 


The festival's major participants should 
include King Ericall, all of the NPCs listed in 
the Nonplayer Characters section, all charac 
ters who decide to attend, and any of your 
own NPCs that you might want to include in 
the campaign. 

The festival is a 2-week affair, featuring 
plenty of entertainment and refreshments. 
The king is very concerned that the party be a 
success, so he has taken extra precautions to 
ensure that no thieves, spies, or other unde 
sirables disrupt it. 

During the first few days of the festival, the 
king meets privately with each character and 
NPC interested in claiming a dominion. The 
characters may choose an area of Norwold 
that they would like as their dominion (see 
Establishing Dominions for details). In cases 
where several characters and NPCs have cho 
sen the same dominion, the king uses the 
tournament to determine which character 
may rightfully claim the land. Make sure that 
some of the NPCs choose the same territories 
as the characters. This will add conflict to the 
process. 

Feel free to add any other conflicts to the 
festival that you wish. Naturally, high-level 
thieves would be attracted to such a gathering 
of wealth. Perhaps even a kidnapping may 
occur. You are limited only by your imagina 
tion, and by your decision as to how much 
time you wish to spend on this scenario. 

Establishing dominions 

The king's provisions 

Any character who is level 15 or higher, and 
who shows up at the king's palace in Alpha 
may claim a dominion in Norwold, provided 
he agrees to the following conditions: 

1. The character must swear fealty to 
King Ericall of Norwold. 

2. The character must pledge to pay the 
standard rate of taxation on all income 
earned by the dominion. Because carving a 
dominion from the wilderness is so difficult, 
characters are excused from their tax respon 
sibilities for 2 years. If a character claims a 
dominion in civilized lands or borderlands, 
he is not allowed a tax reprieve. 

3. The character must solemnly swear 
that he has no ties to the empire of Thyatis, 
and that he will report the presence of any 
Thyatian ambassadors, emissaries, and spies 
directly to the king. 

Choosing the land 

Players should choose dominions for their 
characters from the area shown on the play- 


12 






LAND GRAB 


ers' map. Have players choose on a first- 
come, first-served basis. Characters may 
claim an amount of land equal to one map 
hex. If a character chooses to have a domin 
ion of civilized lands, he cannot claim any 
more land. Roll ldlO to determine the num 
ber of resources his land holds (see the Com 
panion rules for details). 

If a character chooses to have a dominion 
of borderlands or wilderness, he is entitled to 
ld6+6 resources. When this character chooses 
one hex, roll ldlO to determine the number 
of resources his land holds. If his land holds 
fewer than seven resources, the character 
may choose an adjacent hex of land and roll 
ldlO again for resources. The character may 
choose adjacent hexes and roll ldlO for 
resources until his dominion holds at least 
seven resources. His dominion may hold no 
more than 12 resources. 

Joining the king's court 

Any character or NPC who claims a domin 
ion under King Ericall becomes a member of 
the king's court. Each character begins his 
rule as a Baron or Baroness. The Companion 
rules explain how characters may upgrade 
their titles by adding land and citizens to their 


dominions. 

No matter what title a character goes by, a 
member of the king's court is always known 
as a lord. The king usually requests the pres 
ence of all of his lords at court in Alpha twice 
a year. 

A rough status does exist among lords. The 
character having the higher rank has more 
status. If two characters are in the same rank 
(both are barons, for example), the character 
holding the most land has greater status. This 
measurement of status has little real meaning 
in your campaign, but you may use it to cre 
ate rifts or alliances within a king's court. 

Campaign time scale 

The events described in this adventure 
should occur over a time period of 1 to 2 
years. If characters claim their dominions in 
spring, they have one full summer to develop 
their lands. You should scatter the events and 
encounters over the time period, making sure 
the characters have enough time to develop 
their dominions. 

Following is a possible plan for the time 
period whose events are described in this 
adventure: 


1. Spring festival; the characters arrive in 
Alpha to claim their dominions. 

2. Summer; the characters explore the 
dungeons of Kwyll (see Norwold Encounter 
2 ). 

3. Autumn; the characters witness (and 
possibly take part in) the barbarian's battle 
(see Norwold Encounter 4). 

4. Winter; frost giants invade Norwold 
(see Major Events). 

5. Early spring; the characters receive 
their invitations to the wedding of King Eri 
call. 

6. Spring; the characters may help a dwar- 
ven clan regain their Forge of Power (see 
Norwold Encounter 3). 

7. Summer; the characters attend the 
wedding of King Ericall (see Major Events). 

8. Late autumn; the characters move to 
stop a small band of frost giants making raids 
in their dominions (see Norwold Encounter 

i). 

9. Winter; the characters travel to meet 
the crones of Crystykk (see Norwold Encoun 
ter 5). 

10. Spring; the characters return to find 
the empires of Alphatia and Thyatis fully 
engaged in the War of the Crown.

MAJOR EVENTS: BRINGING DOMINIONS TOGETHER 



Two major Norwold events are detailed in 
this section. Each event should occur during 
the time frame of your campaign. 

Each event is keyed to a specific season of 
the year, and should occur regardless of the 
character's actions. Characters need not take 
part in the events, but each event is designed 
so that characters may participate in it and 
possibly affect its outcome. 

The events also involve a large number of 
NPCs, so you should take a little extra time to 
prepare for them. 

For suggestions on where to place these 
events in your campaign, see the Campaign 
Time Scale guidelines in the Land Grab sec 
tion. 

The royal wedding 

Your Most Honorable Lordship (Lady 
ship): 

His Majesty , King Ericall of Norwold , 
wishes to extend his hospitality upon the 
occasion of his wedding. 

The Day of the Summer Solstice has been 
selected for the ceremony and celebration , 
to be held in the Great Hall of the Royal 
Palace in Alpha. 

The week preceding the event will be 
devoted to festivities appropriate to the 
occurrence; thus, your presence in Alpha 
for this time will be desired. 

Wishing the Spring blooms soon upon 
your lands , may the season be a happy 
one! 

Ericall , King of 
Norwold 

Each of the invitations to King Ericall's wed 
ding is engraved on a thin sheet of platinum. 

This gala, high-stepping affair promises to 
be the social event of the century in Norwold! 
Have the characters, as well as all the rest of 
the king's lords and ladies, receive their invi 
tations no later than the winter before the 


wedding. Characters should then have 
enough time to prepare for the trip to Alpha. 

It's not necessary to have the king marry 
the bride described in this section. If one of 
the female characters in your campaign 
wants to marry the king, or if you want to 
have Ericall fall in love with a female charac 
ter, you may arrange such a situation. The 
event goes on as outlined, no matter who is 
standing at the altar. 

If you do decide to use an NPC bride, refer 
to the description below. Remember that 
most residents of Norwold will not even know 
who this woman is until the week before the 
wedding.

Christina is a very likable, albeit strong- 
willed young lady. She has received training 
from some of the most powerful wizards in 
Alphatia, and has learned powers that are not 
often attained by someone of her age. Chris 
tina is 19 years old. 

Christina has a marvelous sense of humor, 
and a great flair for practical jokes. She often 
uses her polymorph self spell for such pur 
poses. 


Christina has not seen her husband-to-be 
since they were small children. Sailing from 
Alphatia, she arrives in Norwold only a few 
weeks before the wedding. Although some 
what unsettled by the move to a new land, 
Christina makes friends easily and has little 
trouble adjusting. 

Wedding week preparations 

All of the NPC lords of Norwold should reach 
Alpha 8 to 10 days before the wedding day. 
King Yarrvik of Oceansend also arrives dur 
ing this time, and should be greeted with the 
fanfare appropriate to his title. 

Any characters who hold dominions in 
Norwold find that they lose a great deal of 
favor with the king if they do not attend his 
wedding. 

King Ericall sees to it that all of his visiting 
lords are put up in fine quarters in the royal 
palace. He also arranges to have all of the 
lords quartered near each other, and reserves 
a large, fully staffed dining room for their 
use. 

The king throws a huge banquet every 
night of the week before the wedding. 
Dominion rulers are granted privileged sta 
tus at the head table during each of the lavish 
banquets. If you wish, you may play through 
one or several of these banquets, using them 
to expand on characters' relationships with 
various NPCs. 

Lernal the Swill, in particular, is very visi 
ble throughout the week. His behavior dur 
ing the banquets should be particularly rude 
and vulgar. His jealousy toward his brother 
should also be readily apparent. 

Wedding week scenarios 

Agents of Thyatis are crawling all over Alpha 
during the wedding week. The agents hatch 
several plots designed to confound and demo 
ralize the leaders of Ericall's dominions. 
These agents try to inflict as much damage as 
possible without revealing any high-placed 
spies. Two of the plots are detailed below. You 
may create and add your own plots to the 
week's festivities as well. 

A night on the town: Following one of the 
week's banquets, the king asks several female 
characters to escort and entertain Christina 
for the evening. (You may have male charac 
ters escort Christina if you have no female 
characters in your campaign.) As soon as the 
bride-to-be joins the characters, she suggests 
an adventure, and tries to persuade her com 
panions to accompany her. 

Christina tells the characters that she is 
going to polymorph into the form of an old 
sailor and visit Alpha's waterfront. She has 


14 






MAJOR EVENTS 


several potions of polymorph with her, so she 
may transform all of her escorts as well. 

If Christina persuades her escorts to join 
her, she insists on visiting every tavern, cafe, 
and store on the waterfront that looks lively. 
Because of the bustling nature of Alpha's 
port, this excursion may take some time. 

A group of kidnappers shadows Christina 
and the characters, following them from the 
palace to the waterfront. These kidnappers 
are fully aware of Christina's and the charac 
ters' true identities. You may have the kid 
nappers*, strike at any time during the 
evening. The kidnappers' statistics are listed 
below.

This magic-user carries a wand of fireballs 
(12 charges), a ring of regeneration, and a 
ring of spell turning. 

The magic-user can cast up to five spells 
before combat begins. The kidnappers try to 
capture Christina (or whoever is Ericall's 
bride-to-be) and take her to the dungeon of 
Alak Dool's stronghold. The kidnappers hold 
her there, refusing to release her until the 
king pays a ransom of 1 million gp. The bride 
should not know where she is being held cap 
tive. 

The black avengers: Begin this scenario dur 
ing one of the wedding week's evening ban 
quets. Read the following boxed text to the 
players when you decide to run the scenario. 


An immense assortment of culinary 
delights is spread out on several tables. 


Dozens of lords and ladies sit at the tables, 
eating and chatting among themselves. 

Suddenly, the massive bronze doors to 
the banquet hall crash inward. Four 
imposing figures, clad head to foot in 
black plate mail, stride into the room. 

A stillness falls over the room. The 
sound of eight heavy boots rings against 
the walls. As the figures approach the 
king, several royal guards leap for their 
weapons. King Ericall holds up his hand, 
stopping the guards. Ericall stands and 
calmly faces the intruders. 

"What is the meaning of this?" he 
demands quietly. 

The intruders halt. One advances sev 
eral steps beyond the others. "We are here 
to honor the wedding of a king to a com 
mon tramp. If you have four warriors 
bold enough to claim otherwise, meet us 
on the field of trial at dawn." 

The intruders then turn to leave. 


King Ericall requests that four of his lords 
represent the queen as champions. The lords 
should be fighters or demi-humans. Any 
character may participate in the combat, but 
the character may not use spells, as this 
would dishonor the queen. Only the force of 
arms may settle these duels. 

A Chaotic church has ordered the four 
black avengers to disrupt the king's wedding 
and weaken his domain. The Chaotic fighters 
are hoping to lower the status of the king's 
knights. If the fighters defeat Ericall's 
knights, the king suffers a great loss of face.

90' (30'); #AT 1 two-handed sword; D

1,350 

All fighter combat options are acceptable for 
these duels. If you do not have four charac 
ters in your campaign that are appropriate 
for the duels, use all of the fighting characters 
you have, and fill out the group with NPC 
lords (or ladies-this is not a discriminatory 
contest!). If you have more than four charac 
ters who could participate in the contest, you 
may increase the number of avengers to 
match the number of characters. 

If the characters lose the duels, the wed 
ding goes on as scheduled, but a pall is cast 
over the entire proceedings. 

The wedding day 

Naturally, the day of the ceremony is a 
delightfully sunny day, unless of course, the 
bride has been kidnapped, or the black 
avengers have triumphed over the queen's 
champions. The day is then a dark and fore 

15 


boding one. 

If the wedding is scheduled to go on as 
planned, and the characters have succeeded 
at their various tests of the week, read the fol 
lowing boxed text to the players when the 
wedding begins. 


Banners, candles, and other royal decora 
tions bedeck the Great Hall of Alpha. A 
collection of Alphatia's finest bards plays 
music that sings first of high celebration 
and then of sober responsibility. A huge 
mirror at the far end of the hall reflects an 
atmosphere of elegance. The 10-foot-wide 
mirror towers 30 feet high, and makes the 
cavernous hall seem even larger than it 
really is. 

The king stands proudly at the altar. 
Only his fidgeting hands belie the look of 
unruffled calm on his face. 

A trace of a smile suddenly dances 
across the king's lips. Heads turn, and 
everyone looks to the back of the hall. The 
bride is stunningly beautiful. Silk and 
satin cascade from her shoulders like 
waterfalls of flowing diamond. Her face, 
normally so impish, bears an expression 
of serene dignity. 

The bride walks slowly down the aisle, 
and then takes the king's arm in hers. 

The wedding is short, but dignified. 
The chief cleric proceeds through the cere 
mony gracefully. As his final act, the cleric 
pronounces that the king and his bride are 
now husband and wife. 

Suddenly, a shadow falls over the room. 
Thunder rumbles in the distance. The 
great mirror on the wall fades to darkness. 
Smoke swirls in the glass as the room's 
reflection disappears. The face of an ugly 
old crone forms in the mirror's mists. Her 
wrinkled visage twists into an evil grin. 

"Good afternoon, my friends," the 
crone says. Her voice has the quality of 
fingernails scraping across a smooth slate. 
"Enjoy your celebration while you can, 
my king," she cackles. "Storm clouds are 
gathering on the horizon, darker than any 
you've known. If you and yours are alive 
after the passing of another summer, then 
you may be happy. Until then, sleep 
lightly, king." Her terrible laughter rings 
once more through the hall. The image 
slowly fades from the mirror, and the 
shadow of darkness lifts. 

The woman in the mirror is Chasandri, one 
of the crones of Crystykk. See the Norwold 
Encounters section for more information 
about these crones. 




MAJOR EVENTS 


Raiders in the snow 

This event should take place during the first 
winter the characters spend in Norwold. For 
campaign purposes, describe this winter to 
the characters as being extremely cold and 
snowy. Raging blizzards strike in late fall, 
and lakes and rivers freeze over. The farmers 
of Norwold are hit particularly hard. Many 
of their animals die off, and they are forced to 
harvest their crops early, resulting in an 
unusually poor yield. 

Because of the premature winter, the water 
passage between Frosthaven and Norwold 
freezes early. The frost giants that live in 
Frosthaven see this as an opportunity for an 
extended raid of Norwold. All 2,000 of the 
male frost giants living in Frosthaven cross 
the ice passage by late fall. 

For details on these frost giants, see the 
notes on Frosthaven in The Setting section. 
Use the War Machine rules from the D&D(r) 
Companion set when you run this event. 

The plan of attack 

Shortly after the giants cross the ice passage 
into Norwold, they separate into 20 bands of 
100 giants each. Each band of giants has a 
Battle Rating of 114. 

The giants can move 24 miles per day, or 7 
hexes per week. 

Ten of the giant bands move straight south 
toward the halfling dominions. These bands 
attack and plunder any strongholds or settle 
ments that lie in their path. If the giants can 
not immediately conquer a stronghold or 
settlement, however, they move on. 

The other 10 giant bands move southeast 
ward toward the mouth of the Great Bay. 
These bands also loot and plunder settle 
ments along the way, but they do not spend 
much time in any one area. 

Use a pencil to keep track of the movement 
of the giant bands on DM Map 2. Remember 
that no characters or NPCs (including the 
king) find out about the raid until some survi 
vor brings word of what he has seen. Since 
several elven communities lie in the giants' 
paths, it won't be too long before word of the 
raids reaches the civilized lands. However, 
this information should be sketchy at best. 

After the two major groups of giant bands 
have reached opposite ends of the Great Bay, 
both groups move into the climax of their 
raid. Because the winter has been so severe, 
the Great Bay is completely frozen across. 
The giants at the eastern end of the bay begin 
crossing the ice, while the giants at the west 
ern end cross the White Bear River, and 
begin heading east. 

The two groups of giant bands now com 
bine in a large pincer movement, moving 


along the south shore of the Great Bay and 
plundering any dominions that they come 
across there. The giants are making their 
move on the city of Alpha. 

The call to arms goes out soon after word of 
the raid reaches Alpha. All of King Ericall's 
armies mobilize for war. The king orders all 
of his lords (both characters and NPCs) to 
make for Alpha with as many troops as they 
can raise. 

Movement restrictions 

Because of the deep snow, cut the movement 
rate of all normal forces in half, unless they 
are equipped with skis or snowshoes. Elven 
and halfling troops have such equipment, but 
a character's forces should be so equipped 
only if the character makes appropriate 
arrangements. 

No movement restrictions apply to the 
frost giants. Deep snow is their natural ele 
ment. 

Encountering the giants 

In most cases, character lords encounter 
bands of no more than 100 giants. You should 
also keep track of and resolve encounters 
between giant bands and NPC lords. The 
giants are not selective about whose domin 
ions they raid. 

The characters may be able to combine 
several forces and destroy some of the giant 
bands piecemeal. If your players want you to 
run individual combat for an encounter 
between characters and giants, use the fol 
lowing statistics for each frost giant the char 
acters encounter. 

Frost Giant: AC 4; HD 10+1*; hp 46; #AT 1 
club/hurl rocks; D 4-14/3-18; Save F10; 
ML 9; AL C; XP 1,600 

You may want to increase a giant's hit points 
if a character fights a frost giant chieftain or 
an accomplished giant warrior. 

Once the characters and NPCs have 
defeated a few giant bands, the giants pull in 
their extended formations and move in two 
blocks of 1,000 giants each (minus any casu 
alties the characters and NPCs may have 
inflicted). If characters and NPCs manage to 
rout one of these massive groups, consider all 
giants in that group to be defeated, for cam 
paign purposes. They are considered 
defeated because any survivors would flee for 
Frosthaven. 

Unless the characters and NPCs send all of 
the giants running back to Frosthaven in the 
early phases of the raid, you should set the 
stage for a major battle near Alpha. The two 
large groups of giant bands avoid the moun 
tains at the foot of the capital peninsula. 


Rather, they go around the mountains by 
crossing the ice of the bay. Once the two 
groups pass the mountains, however, they 
unite and advance on Alpha as one massive 
force. 

If the king's forces do not advance to meet 
the giants, the giants besiege the city. The 
characters' advice should weigh heavily in 
the king's decisions about battle strategy. In 
any event, the giants withdraw to the north 
24 weeks after their raid began. They must 
return to Frosthaven before the bridge of ice 
between the two lands begins to melt. 

Remember that the giants are not trying to 
conquer Norwold. Their aim is to plunder, 
and if they are successful, they head back to 
Frosthaven heavily laden with treasure. 

Ending the raid 

After the giants' raid has ended, King Ericall 
evaluates the performance of each of his lords 
in battle. The king may add lands to the hold 
ings of a lord who acted courageously and 
heroically in the battle. The king may also 
decrease the holdings of a lord who per 
formed less than enthusiastically in battle. 

Remember that your campaign is a living, 
changing operation. Situations that arise 
during this period of tension may have long- 
lasting effects. Characters may prove them 
selves as trustworthy, or they may prove that 
they cannot be counted among the king's 
trusted advisors. 

The raids and ensuing battles may also 
decrease the population of Norwold, which 
may result in a loss of income for the lords.

NORWOLD ENCOUNTERS: EXPANDING THE CAMPAIGN 



Five short encounters are detailed in this sec 
tion. You should be able to run each of the 
encounters in 2-4 hours of playing time. You 
may insert these encounters into your cam 
paign as you see fit. Some of the encounters 
should take place during specific seasons. See 
the Campaign Time Scale guidelines in the 
Land Grab section for details. 

Each encounter serves a specific purpose 
relating to the conflict between the empires of 
Alphatia and Thyatis. You should run these 
encounters before running the War of the 
Crown. Try to assemble as many characters 
as possible for each of these encounters, as the 
challenges will be difficult, and the characters 
will need a wide variety of skills. 

A suggested setting is given at the begin 
ning of each encounter. These settings are 
designed to bring the characters into the 
encounter. Feel free to disregard these set 
tings if they are not consistent with your cam 


paign. You may also come up with your own 
ways of involving characters in encounters. 

In most cases, the location of the encoun 
ters is also left up to you. Some encounters do 
list suggested Norwold locations. 

Three of the encounters include maps for 
your reference. The other two encounters do 
not require maps. You may map areas for the 
characters to explore in these two encounters, 
if you wish. 

Encounter 1: 

The ruins of Alinor 

(Use DM Map 3.) 

Encounter setting 

The people of Norwold are panicking! Mes 
sengers bring word of a large band of frost 
giants, raiding far to the south of their usual 
stomping grounds. The farmers are too busy 


guarding their homes from invasion to work 
the fields or tend the animals; as a result, pro 
ductivity is dropping rapidly. 

Tell the characters that the most recent 
reports about the giants have placed them 
somewhere in the middle of the characters' 
dominions. Explain that a high-level force 
may be the farmers' only hope. 

If this information motivates the charac 
ters, then you may go ahead with the encoun 
ter. If the characters do not react, explain that 
the giants are bound to devastate small com 
munities, and the farmers will demand pro 
tection before they return to work. 

If characters send an armed force to meet 
the giants (via the War Machine rules), the 
force fails to locate the giants unless accompa 
nied by one or more characters. As soon as 
characters lead a force in search of the giants, 
you may go to area Al. 

Encounter key 
Al. STAMPEDE! 

A fresh trail leads into a small cluster of 
rocky hills. The terrain surrounding the 
trail climbs steeply. There appear to be no 
signs of human habitation here. 

Suddenlythe sound of heavy footfalls 
shakes the ground. Gasping breaths come 
from the rocks to the east. Both ominous 
sounds are quickly drawing closer.

NORWOLD ENCOUNTERS 


One round after characters enter this area, 
four frost giants emerge from the rocky hills. 
They come running around a bend in the 
narrow trail. The giants' mouths are hanging 
open in desperate gasps for breath, and looks 
of crazed fear fill their faces. Every few sec 
onds, one of the giants glances over his shoul 
der. 

The giants furiously attack any characters 
who stand in their way. Once the giants fail 
their morale check, however, they run past 
the characters toward the west. They do not 
go back toward the east for any reason.

These giants are carrying nothing of value. 

A2. THE RAIDERS' CAMP 

As characters approach the opening to this 
cave, read the following boxed text to the 
players. 

The rocky trail winds north to the mouth 
of a cave. The orange light of a fire flickers 
cheerily within the cave. The rich smell of 
roasting venison wafts outward, accompa 
nied by the sound of sizzling meat. 

Lying motionless around the fire in the 
cave are the bodies of several giants. 
Expressions of terror are frozen on their 
faces. Their cold eyes are fixed with the 
stare of death. 

Five more dead giants lie beyond the 
fire. Weapons are clenched in the giants' 
stiffening fingers. The bodies of at least a 
dozen large wolves lie scattered among the 
dead giants. It appears as if some incredi 
bly powerful force used a blunt instru 
ment to kill the giants. 

If characters inspect the bodies of the giants 
or the wolves, they see that the attack on these 
creatures occurred within the last half-hour. 
The meat roasting over the fire has just 
begun to burn, and is in fact quite edible. If 
characters examine the cave more closely, 
read the following boxed text to the players. 

This cave is large and irregularly shaped. 
Dirty furs, clubs, and three large sacks are 
scattered carelessly about the floor. A pile 
of dry wood is stacked near the fire. 

Many loose stones lie on the floor near a 
gaping, black hole in the cave's east wall. 
The hole is about 10 feet in diameter, and 
appears to puncture the wall, leading into 
the bedrock at a steep, downward angle. 

The sacks contain some of the treasure the 
giants plundered from farmers. One sack 


contains copper and silver dishes and uten 
sils. The other two sacks contain the follow 
ing coins: 7,330 cp, 1,680 sp, and 213 gp. 
The weight of each sack is equal to 5,000 cn. 

If the characters go through the dark tun 
nel in the east wall, they notice that the air in 
it is damp, musty, and stale. Some dust hangs 
in the air, but none has settled on the walls or 
floor. There are no footprints in the tunnel. 

A3. THE STING 

The sound of crunching rises from this 
cave. Several crablike creatures are 
swarming over the carcass of some animal 
in this room. The creatures' giant mandi 
bles cause the horrible crunching sound. 
The only other sound in this room is the 
occasional click of hard carapaces knock 
ing into each other. 

This cave is the lair of six giant scorpions. 
The scorpions are feasting on one of the frost 
giants' slain wolves. 

If any characters walk into this cavern, the 
scorpions rush forward and try to sink their 
claws into this new, fresh meat.

If the scorpions fail a morale check, they 
retreat into their lair,which is empty. 

A4. THE DOORMAN 

A dull roar echoes off the walls of this 
rough hallway. Cool, moist breezes blow 
softly through the tunnel. The echoing 
roar slowly grows to a pounding thunder. 

The tunnel widens as a bubbling stream 
of water enters from the south wall and 
rushes forward toward the east. The 
stream water runs 50 feet along the south 
wall of the tunnel, and then drops over the 
lip of a precipice. 

The tunnel eventually opens into a 
huge cavern, which is lit by a dim, phos 
phorescent glow. The silhouette of a mon 
strous figure partially blocks the cavern's 
eerie light. The huge humanoid shape 
stands motionless at the mouth of the cav 
ern, its head nearly touching the 16-foot- 
high ceiling. 

The figure is a bronze golem that has been 
charged with the task of preventing any crea 
tures from entering the cavern. The golem 
does not move unless a character comes 
within 40 feet of it, or if a character attacks it. 
In either case, the golem attacks immediately. 


Bronze Golem: AC 0; HD 20 * * *; hp 97; MV 
240' (80'); #AT 1 fist + special; D 3-30 + 
1-10 (heat); Save F10; ML 12; AL N; 
XP 4,300 

The golem fights desperately to prevent any 
character from entering the cavern. If any 
characters run past the golem, it pursues the 
characters. If any characters fly past the 
golem, the creature summons the drolem 
from area A5 to attack the flying characters. 

Beyond the golem, the floor of the cavern 
gives way to a sheer cliff. 

A5. THE OLD GUARD 

The eerie glow of green phosphorescence 
lights this mysterious cavern. The mist 
from the plunging falls drifts through the 
cave and settles on the shattered, mossy 
stones of what once must have been 
mighty columns. 

A large pool, rippled by the flow of the 
waterfall, covers much of the cave floor. 
Square corners of stone, fitted with brass 
and iron, jut upward from the water in 
several places, hinting at the proud ances 
try of this crumbled ruin. 

Slender granite columns, which once 
must have graced an awesome fortress, lie 
broken in mossy, stagnant water. The 
facade of a building strains beneath the 
weight of a collapsed cavern wall, and 
mighty brass doors, now tarnished and 
moldy, hang loosely on their hinges. 
Beyond these doors, all is dark. 

This ruin is all that remains of a once mighty 
port. Earthquakes and erosion caused it to 
sink below ground level. The destructive 
actions of the elements have destroyed all but 
this tiny portion. 

A mighty magic-user was once lord of this 
city. The building before which the characters 
now stand was the magic-user's palace. Lurk 
ing within the palace is the magic-user's 
"pet" drolem, which was instructed to kill 
anyone who entered this hallowed realm. 
Unless the golem from area A4 summons it, 
the drolem emerges from the ruined palace 
while the characters are climbing down to the 
cavern floor. 

Drolem: AC -3; HD 20*****; hp 112; MV

#AT 2 claws/1 bite; D 2-12/2-12/11-30 + 
breath; Save F10 + immunities; ML 12; 
AL N; XP 7,750 

The drolem fights to the death. It uses its 
breath weapon if it can catch more than one 


19 



character in its area of effect. 

If the characters slay the drolem, they find 
that the only items of interest in the cavern 
are within the palace walls. As soon as char 
acters enter the palace, they recognize it as a 
structure of former grandeur. Rubble and 
broken stones line the hallways, and lime 
stone, fallen from the cavern walls, chokes 
most of the palace's open areas. 

Two areas of the palace, however, have 
managed to escape the ravages of time. Each 
of these areas is described below in detail. 
You may create your own map of these areas, 
if you wish. 

Palace library: As characters enter the pal 
ace, they see a brass door in the wall to the 
left. The door is closed. Behind the door lies a 
library. Many tomes, most of them moldy 
and unreadable, line the shelves here. 

If characters search the library, they find a 
small compartment behind one of the 
shelves. The compartment is a secret door, 
protected by a poison needle trap. If charac 
ters open the secret door, they find a small 
gold box. The box is not trapped, but if char 
acters check, it does radiate magic. If charac 
ters smash or pry open the box, all of its 
contents burn in a flash. If a thief picks the 
box lock, the characters find the following 
items inside: a scroll of creation, a scroll of 
truth, and a diary. 

If characters examine the diary, they find 
that it is the journal of "Alinor, prince of 
Alphia." In it, Alinor relates the story of his 
people's migration to the west, traveling on 
ships that "towered to the very clouds." 
Alinor brought his people to a new land, built 
a city, and declared a kingdom dedicated to 
the consummate power of magic. With the 
aid of a potent staff created by Alinor, his peo 
ple conquered dominions of savages to the 
north and south. 


As characters read further in the diary, 
they discover that Alinor became increas 
ingly obsessed with the idea of mastering not 
just his people, but the very land itself. 
Alinor's last entry describes his intentions to 
raise a mountain range through the use of 
arcane arts. 

Palace tomb: Standing at the far end of the 
palace's main hallway are two huge doors 
made of gleaming gold. The doors are closed. 
The doors creak loudly as characters push 
them open. 

Dust and spiderwebs cover the shadowy 
room that lies beyond the doors. Shattered 
columns and crumbled mosaics litter the 
floor. 

If characters examine the room, they dis 
cover that it was once a throneroom. A tall, 
ivory throne lies on its side in one corner of 
the room. Much of the throne's ornate carv 
ing is cracked or smashed. 

If characters take the time to examine the 
room more closely, they see two skeletal 
hands reaching out from under a massive 
stone block. Clutched in the bony fingers is a 
staff, which gleams as if it has just been pol 
ished. The staff is a rod of victory. 

The only other items of value in this room 
are the doors. Each door is worth 20,000 gp, 
and each weighs an equivalent amount. 

Encounter 2: 

The dungeon of Kwyll 

(Use DM Map 4.) 

Encounter setting 

The evil cleric Kwyll originally constructed 
the dungeon shown in DM Map 4. The cleric 
was able to attract a number of ferocious 


monsters to the dungeon, and things seemed 
to be going very well . . . until the hellhounds 
got hungry. 

The monsters control this dungeon now, 
and Kwyll's evil spirit, now in the form of a 
druj, is confined to one room. The monsters 
don't seem to mind the lack of leadership; in 
fact, they've been doing pretty well on their 
own. 

Trolls, fire giants, and hellhounds leave the 
dungeon and roam freely at night, taking res 
idents prisoner and carrying them back to the 
dungeon. The monsters loot and plunder 
along the way as well. The dungeon's newest 
resident is a red dragon, which has not yet 
paid a visit to the countryside. 

You may draw the characters into this 
encounter by having them listen to numerous 
complaints from farmers and villagers: 
"Them foul things stole my wife, and I want 
her back!" Of course, characters may send a 
low level party of adventurers to clear out the 
monsters, but they should probably become 
more curious when the party fails to return! 

You should locate Kwyll's dungeon in the 
wilderness area of one of the character's 
dominions. Explain to the characters that 
finding the dungeon is easy, because the mon 
sters are not very good at covering their 
tracks. Start the encounter at area Bl.

Bl. OLD SMOKYNOSE 

Old Smokynose is a large red dragon that 
moved into the dungeon. "Smoky" was 
attracted by the treasure in area B7. The 
dragon is still trying to figure out how to deal 
with the beholder that guards the treasure in 
that area. Smoky hasn't yet made his move 
on the beholder. The dragon ignores the dun-

Smoky fights intelligently, and if characters 
reduce its hit points to 25 or fewer, the dragon 
tries to leave the dungeon, either by fleeing 
through the entrance or by using the dimen

Eight trolls arrive from area B4 2-5 rounds 
after the dragon attacks the characters. The 
trolls immediately join the battle. 

A shallow well stands in an alcove in this 
cave's southeast comer. When other mon 
sters leave food for the dragon, they leave it in 
this area. There is nothing of value in this 
alcove. 

B2. OFFICE 

The door to this room is locked. 

Thick furs cover the walls and floor of this 
neat, well-furnished room. Several huge 
chairs stand next to a massive fireplace in 
the room's southwest corner. A desk, lit 
tered with parchment, stands against the 
east wall. 

Six sheets of parchment lie on the desk. Each 
bears an unfinished attempt at a coat of arms. 
Each coat of arms includes these features: a 
human skull, a black mace, and a stake 
driven through the letter "A." The text var 
ies from scroll to scroll. Characters may be 
able to read these phrases: "Kwyll the 
Mighty," "Kwyll, King of the World," and 
"Kwyll the Invincible." 

B3. KWYLL'S HOME 

Heavy iron bars rest across these doors. 

The door to this room opens with a grim 
creak. Beyond the door lies a filthy room, 
littered with dust, dirt, and bones. A grin 
ning skull rests on a table near the south 
wall. Many of the other bones in the room 
look as if they may also have been part of a 
human skeleton. 


Moldy leather and pieces of cloth are 
piled in the center of the floor, and other 
bits of miscellaneous junk are scattered 
about the room. 

Kwyll has become a skull druj, and has been 
imprisoned in this room. If it is daytime, he is 
invisible. He moves out the door as soon as 
characters open it. In this case, explain to the 
characters that the skull on the table is that of 
an unlucky adventurer. Kwyll remains out 
side the dungeon, waiting to attack the char 
acters as soon as night falls. 

If it is night, Kwyll attacks the characters 
as soon as they enter the room.

B4. TROLL HAVEN 

A feeble fire in the center of this room fills 
the air with sooty smoke. Several well- 
gnawed bones lie scattered about the floor. 
Some crude clubs are piled against the 
west wall. A dirty sack lies along the north 
wall near the cave opening. 

This cave is the home of eight trolls. The 
characters may already have fought these 
trolls in area Bl. If the characters somehow 
passed the dragon without being noticed, 
they encounter the trolls in this area. The 
trolls attack the characters as soon as they see 
them.

An alcove stands along the cave's south 
wall. A locked chest sits in the alcove. The 
chest is trapped with a particularly deadly 
poison needle (-5 penalty to saving throw). 
The chest contains 4,000 sp, 850 gp, and 25

B5. HALL OF THE FIRE GIANTS 

Flickering splashes of orange and red light 
dance on the walls of this huge cavern. 
The intense heat of a large fire pours forth 
from the cave. Every few seconds, the fire 
crackles greedily as more fuel is added to 
it. 

A band of fire giants lives in this lair. They 
are gathered around a towering blaze, enjoy 
ing sizzling haunches of fresh meat. The 
giants are quite unaware of any occurrences 
in other parts of the dungeon. Read the fol 
lowing boxed text to the players as the char 
acters enter the giants' lair. 

The crimson flames light the smudged 
faces of the giants. The creatures chew, 
grin, and bite off huge hunks of meat from 
the haunches they are holding. Juice runs 
through their beards like red rivers. 

As soon as the characters come into view, one 
of the giants notices them. All but one of the 
giants leap to attack the characters. The 
remaining giant pauses for 1 round to pull 
open the release on the hellhounds' cage 
(area B 6).

out of the dungeon, fleeing to the west.

Two terrified farmers lie against the south

of its raids in the countryside. The farmers 
tell the characters that more farmers and vil 
lagers are locked up in a cage in area B7. 

The giants have no treasure in this room. 
They keep their treasure in area B7, where a

cage opening. There doesn't appear to be 
any kind of mechanism for raising the

B7. THE EYE OF DEATH 

A grim apparition floats in the center of 
this large cavern. The creature appears to 
be a giant, disembodied eye, but as the 
seconds go by, more features become 
apparent. 

The creature is round and covered with 
some sort of plate material. Its eye stares 
forward from its center. Tubes, which 
resemble the legendary Medusa's snakes, 
wave from the top of the creature. A sin 
gle, glaring eye stares out from the top of 
each tube. 

Treasures of every size and shape are 
scattered about this shadowy cave. 

Suddenly, the great eye begins to move 
forward, its eye-tubes waving ominously. 

The creature in this cave is a beholder. The 
beholder never leaves this cave; in fact, it 
always stays within 30 feet of the center of the 
cave. It uses all of its abilities to destroy any 
one or anything that enters its lair. The 
beholder may summon any monsters that are 
still in the dungeon to help fight the charac 
ters.

Eight villagers stand in an alcove behind 
iron bars in the cave's east end. These vil 
lagers cheer the characters on as they fight the 
monsters, but they are anxious to be set free. 
They tell the characters so several times. 


Encounter 3: Revenge of the 
mountain clan 

(Use DM Map 5.) 

Encounter setting 

The mad wizard Gargantua, through a proc 
ess of trial and error, has located a natural 
cavern near a dwarven stronghold. He tele 
ported several of his monster "friends" to the 
cavern and directed them to attack the 
dwarves. The monsters broke through a wall 
in the dwarven stronghold, and now they 
hold the chamber that is the home for the 
dwarves' Forge of Power. 

Because the dwarves lack the magical 
weapons needed to defeat many of the mon 
sters in the caves, they are reluctantly forced 
to ask for help. 

To emphasize the importance of their 
appeal, the dwarves send their Clanmaster 
and the Keeper of the Forge to ask the charac 
ters for help. Twelve dwarven bodyguards (all 
ninth level) accompany the two clan leaders.

Gard wears plate mail +1. He is a proud and

uncomfortable asking humans for help.

CH 7 

Niddrow is a small, bespectacled dwarf who 
has been driven to distraction by the loss of 
his forge. He is always cleaning his glasses, 
scratching his beard, and making remarks 
like, "Oh, dear me!" 

The two dwarves tell the characters about the 
monsters breaking through a wall into their 
stronghold. They tell the characters that the 
Clanholder, a twelfth level dwarf of high com 
bat prowess, led a party into the forgeroom 
after gargoyles had taken it. All of the 
dwarves were slain. The dwarves do not 
know that a gargantuan troll is also lurking in 
the forgeroom. 

The dwarves offer the characters two possi 
ble rewards. All characters must agree on 
which reward they will take before they go 
into the dwarven stronghold. The dwarves 
offer: 

1. An immediate reward payment of 
100,000 gp in gems. 

2. A "pledge of call," which would allow 
the characters to call upon the dwarven clan 


for help one time only. If the characters use 
the call, the dwarves mobilize their entire 
military force for a period of time up to 3 
months. The dwarves agree to help the char 
acters accomplish any task. They do not, 
however, perform any sort of evil deed. 

The dwarves refer to their stronghold as 
Stormhaven. It is a network of caves located 
high in a rugged mountain range. A profit 
able mining operation provides the economic 
foundation of the clan, which has 2,500 mem 
bers. The clan can field a military force of 
1,000 in times of duress, or in answer to a 
call. 

The characters do not encounter Gargan 
tua the wizard in this encounter. He is the 
force behind the monsters in the dwarven 
stronghold, however. 

You may place this encounter in any 
mountainous hex that you wish, although 
you should probably place it somewhere near 
the characters' dominions. 

The dwarves' forgeroom is located deep in 
the heart of a massive mountain peak. Char 
acters may reach it only by passing through 2 
miles of mazelike tunnels. When characters 
are ready to begin the encounter, go to area 
Cl.

Cl. THE FORGEROOM 

Characters may approach this chamber from 
any one of three corridors. The dwarves have 
set up blockades in each of the corridors, 200 
feet from the forgeroom opening. A dozen 
dwarves guard each of the blockades. Noth 
ing else lies between the blockades and the 
chamber itself. 

Characters must have their own light 
sources here, as these tunnels and caves are 
totally dark. 

The spots marked "G" on DM Map 5 
show the locations of three gargantuan gar 
goyles. A pedestal rests in the center of the 
cave. The pedestal once held the forge, but it 
is now empty.

the three corridors, the gargoyles rush for 
ward to attack. Otherwise, they do not leave 
this chamber.

This loose pile of stone is what's left of the 
forgeroom's east wall. The gargantuan crea 
tures created the rubble when they broke 
through the wall into the forgeroom. 

A gargantuan carrion crawler is hiding 
under the rubble. Characters cannot see the 
creature, nor can they use infravision to 
detect it, because it is covered with dust. The 
crawler lashes out to attack any characters 
who cross the rubble. The crawler gains auto 
matic surprise on the first round.

accompany the gargoyle. The gargoyle keeps

springing them loose when intruders enter 
the tunnels. The gargoyle then tries to circle 
around any intruders and attack from the 
rear while the basilisks attack the front.

Spectacular crystal stalactites line the walls of

The Forge of Stormhaven lies in the center 
of the room. If characters have a light source, 
they see twelve gargantuan trolls standing 
along the walls of the cave! There is actually 
only one troll in the cave, but the mirrorlike 
rocks of the walls reflect the creature's image 
several times over. 

If characters attack before they realize they 
are seeing an illusion, they have only a 1 in 12 
chance of attacking the real creature.

fully. It tries to gain surprise, if possible. The

stand in their way of recovering the relic. 

Encounter 4: 
Barbarians' battle 

Encounter background 

A large number of humans have lived in 
Norwold for centuries, long before any 


empire viewed the region with covetous eyes. 
These people's civilization has not advanced 
greatly, but the people have managed to fare 
well as nomads and hunters. Explorers collec 
tively refer to these people as "barbarians." 

These barbarians are mainly fighters, 
thieves, and clerics. None of the thieves' or 
clerics' abilities has developed beyond 10th 
level, but fighting barbarians can be the 
equal of any civilized fighters in levels and 
abilities. 

For most of the year, barbarian tribes tra 
vel in groups of 100 to 1,000 members. Dur 
ing the summer solstice, however, all of the 
barbarians in Norwold gather into three mas 
sive groups. Each of these groups is made up 
of about 15,000 members. Each group can 
muster about 3,800 barbarians as warriors, if 
the need arises. 

The barbarians have never had any trou 
ble with King Ericall, since major portions of 
Norwold have not yet been civilized. As long 
as dominion leaders allow the barbarian 
tribes to pass freely across their dominions, 
there is no trouble. If a dominion leader 
blocks a tribe's passage, however, the barbar 
ians make a Reaction Check. This action 
could result in war. 

Encounter setting 

This encounter begins as the barbarians pass 
through Alak Dool's dominion (see the Non 
player Characters section for details). If you 
do not want to use Alak Dool for the encoun 
ter, or if his dominion is nowhere near any of

NORWOLD ENCOUNTERS 


the characters' dominions, you may use any 
NPC magic-user, as long as he is at least 9th 
level, and has a conjure elemental spell. 

Begin the encounter when the characters 
are traveling through their dominions for 
some reason. They may be hunting, or they 
may be clearing their dominions of monsters. 

While the characters are traveling, they 
receive word of a showdown between a bar 
barian tribe and Alak Dool. The barbarians 
are currently camped on the borders of 
Dool's dominion. There have been no bat 
tles-the barbarians would rather hunt food 
than fight humans-but Dool taunts them 
constantly. 

Dool recently cast invisibility and fly spells 
on himself, and then traveled to the campsite 
of Barkal the Red. Barkal is the chief of this 
barbarian tribe. While hovering over the 
chiefs camp, he conjured an earth elemental 
and ordered it to attack the frightened bar 
barians. 

Barkal, wielding his sword, challenged the 
elemental. The barbarian chief has led the 
elemental out of the camp, and the two are 
now chasing each other through the forest.

When the characters arrive on the scene, 
Barkal is exhausted from the long chase. He 
turns to face the lumbering elemental. The 
barbarian and the monster draw closer to 
each other. In a few seconds, they are wres 
tling. (Barkal's Wrestling Rating is 21. The 
earth elemental's Wrestling Rating is 41.) 

Dool, who controls the elemental from 
overhead, has sent it to wrestle Barkal. Once 
the elemental has pinned the barbarian, it 
starts inflicting damage upon him. Of course, 
the characters may intervene any time they 
wish. 

Six rounds after the wrestling match 
begins, eight of Barkal's warriors arrive on 
the scene. The warriors stop for a moment, 
gasping at the horrible monster that is tan 
gling with their leader. Within seconds, how 
ever, the warriors leap into the fray.

#AT 1; D 2-11; Save F8; ML 10; AL L 


Each warrior wears heavy furs (treat as 
leather armor), and carries a two-handed 
sword. 

If the characters have not intervened to help 
Barkal by the time his warriors arrive, the 
warriors naturally assume that the characters 
are somehow involved in the attack on their 
leader. In this case, six of the warriors attack 
the characters, while the other two aid their 
leader. 

If the characters help Barkal, Dool forces 
the elemental to fight to the death. Dool is 
prepared to flee at a moment's notice, how 
ever, since he doesn't want the characters to 
know that he is involved. 

If Barkal and the characters work together 
to defeat the elemental, the barbarian leader 
invites the characters back to his people's 
camp. 

The barbarians'camp 

Barkal is chief of a tribe of900 barbarians, all 
of whom eagerly await their chiefs return. If 
the characters are with Barkal when he 
returns, the barbarians greet them enthusias 
tically as well. The barbarians serve up an 
improptu feast, and the characters are the 
guests of honor. 

Wrestling matches make up much of the 
evening's entertainment. A number of bar 
barian warriors (including some brawny 
females) wrestle each other in the center of a 
huge ring. They are more than willing to 
wrestle a few of the characters as well. The 
wrestling barbarians are all fighters between 
levels 9 and 20 (ldl2+8). The wrestlers gain 
ld4 on all ability modifiers. None of the wres 
tlers may wear any armor. 

If none of the characters voluntarily enters 
the ring, some of the barbarians challenge the 
characters to matches. The challenges are 
good-natured, and the barbarians take no 
offense if a character refuses. 

If, however, the characters do wrestle and 
manage to show some ability in the ring (if 
they at least hold their own with the barbari 
ans), Barkal closes the evening with the ritual 
of blood-sharing. Each of the characters is 
required to cut his right-hand palm. Barkal 
then cuts his palm. Each character then 
clasps Barkal's right hand, mingling blood 
and allegiance. 

The characters may refuse to take part in 
this ritual, but Barkal loses face in his tribe if 
they do. The whole tribe then feels insulted, 
and the characters may have to deal with 
some unfriendly barbarians. 

If the characters do take part in the cere 
mony, an oath of allegiance is implied 
between the tribe and the characters. If either 


party calls upon the other for assistance in the 
future, the call must be answered as quickly 
and forcefully as possible. 

Encounter 5: 

The crones of Cry sty kk 

Encounter background 

High atop a rocky crag, somewhere in the 
uncivilized lands of Norwold, sits the gloomy 
cave of the crones of Crystykk. These three 
old women are clerics of tremendous power, 
and each has a different alignment. Isolated 
from humanity, these crones spend their time 
observing the world through a powerful crys 
tal mirror, which is the only one of its kind. 

This potent magic item is known as the 
Crystykk Mirror, and it is similar to a crystal 
ball that has clairaudience. Only the crones 
may use the mirror, which is embedded in the 
rock of their cave. 

The crones cannot cast spells through the 
mirror, but they can send messages to others, 
chiefly in the form of dreams. To send such a 
message to an individual, the crones need 
only concentrate on the individual's image as 
it appears in the mirror. Occasionally, the 
crones try to use these dreams to summon 
high-level characters to their cave. 

The crones may use the mirror to speak 
through other normal mirrors. Such an event 
takes place during King Ericall's wedding 
(see the Major Events section, The Wedding 
Day for details). 

Because of their hobby, the crones are 
extremely knowledgeable. They enjoy a good 
fight, and they always demand a high price if 
they win. If the crones are defeated, however, 
they gladly yield important information to 
those who have defeated them. 

Encounter setting 

Use the Dream List to introduce this encoun 
ter to the characters. Tell the players that each 
of their characters awakens one morning with 
the lingering memory of a dream. At first, the 
characters cannot recall any details from their 
dreams. Have each player roll ld20 for his 
character. If the die roll is less than or equal to 
the character's Wisdom score, that character 
remembers his dream. 

Roll ld6 for each character who remem 
bers a dream. Then find the die roll and cor 
responding dream on the Dream List. Do not 
reveal the details of the dreams until you have 
rolled for each of these characters, because 
several characters may have the same dream. 
Once you have determined which dreams the 
characters have had, read the appropriate 
passages to the players.

CRONES OF CRYSTYKK DREAM LIST 

Die Roll: 1 

Dream: A path leads from your home and 
takes you on a journey that lasts several 
days. Finally, a black fortress, rising 
from a dark crag of stone, towers before 
you. As you climb upward, massive 
stone gates swing silently open. As soon 
as you have passed through the gates, 
they slam shut behind you. The icy fin 
gers of fear grip your chest, and every 
thing suddenly goes black. 

Die Roll: 2 

Dream: You awaken in a black room. You 
run to a window and discover that you 
are atop a tall, black tower. The entire 
continent sprawls out below you. Sud 
denly, you know where you are! The 
crones! Three crooked old women have 
locked you here! Through the bars on 
the window, you can see your home. To 
reach it would take days! As you look 
out the window, the land below seems to 
move. Massive ripples, rising up like 
great ocean swells, cross the land. Huge 
cracks appear in the earth, as buildings, 
trees, and people fall helplessly into the 
earth. Your tower sways and begins to 
fall, but before it strikes the ground, you 
catch one last glimpse of Norwold, as a 
gaping fissure splits the land in two. 

Die Roll: 3 

Dream: You have been fighting for days. 
Your arms feel like lead weights. The 
bodies of friend and foe alike lie all 
around you, forming a grisly human 
carpet that stretches for as far as you can 
see. You tell yourself that if you had 
heeded the warnings of the three old 
women, this tragedy could have been 
avoided. Just as this thought crosses 
your mind, the earth convulses beneath 
your feet. A great fissure opens, and 
bodies fall into it, like water flowing over 
a dam. You straddle the fissure, one foot 
on each side, but it grows wider and 
deeper. You realize that you will soon 
join the bodies in the long fall down 
ward. 

Die Roll: 4 

Dream: A wicked, hook-nosed old woman 
beckons you forward with a bony finger. 
You follow her, walking along a road 
that seems to wind for days through 
dark forests and black, frozen moun 
tains. At last the road ends before a 
black fortress, which stands high on a 
gloomy pinnacle of rock. Suddenly, the 
old woman turns and attacks you! She 
casts potent spells and wields a crushing 


mace, but you fight with skill and dar 
ing. The old crone is vanquished. She 
pleads for her life, and offers a treasure 
more valuable than a gem or magic. You 
accept her offer, reaching out to take a 
box that she holds weakly aloft. As you 
open the box, golden light spills out, 
encircling you in warm light. Stories 
seem to unfold from the light. At last 
you understand. 

Die Roll: 5 

Dream: You are balanced carefully on a 
mountain peak, looking down on two 
huge forces that have drawn for battle. 
Standing between the armies are your 
friends, looking upward to you for help. 
Despair washes over you, because you 
know that the only help you could offer 
lies far away, in the fortress on the rocky 
peak. Quiet voices had urged you to go 
there . . . if only you had listened! But it 
is too late now. 

Die Roll: 6 

Dream: A mighty weapon gleams in your 
hand as you prepare to lead your army 
into war. What you carry inside, how 
ever, is even more important. The battle 
is joined. Enemies fall before you like 
wheat under a scythe. Whole armies are 


defeated by the sting of your sword, but 
it is the other weapon-the one you 
carry inside-that truly proves decisive. 
With this in your grasp, you know that 
the future of Norwold is up to you. 

Any character who remembers his dream has 
a clear idea about the location of the black 
fortress. Although each character should 
have a slightly different picture of the fortress 
and of the women who live there, all of the 
characters have dreamed of the same place. 

You may place the fortress of Crystykk 
anywhere you wish in Norwold. You do not 
have to place it in a mountainous area if you 
don't want to. Ideally, the characters should 
have to travel several days from the nearest 
character dominion to reach the fortress. 

Journey to the fortress 

Select or roll a few random encounters from 
the chart on p. 31. Have these encounters 
occur as the characters travel to the fortress of 
Crystykk. 

On the last night before the characters 
reach Crystykk, they have the following 
encounter. 

Three aerial servants, one summoned by 
each of the crones, raid the characters' camp. 
Each of the crones has instructed her servant 



25 


NORWOLD ENCOUNTERS 



to steal a powerful magic item from the char 
acters. You should select these items. Keep in 
mind that the crones are aware of everything 
the characters are carrying, and they are 
likely to select those items that might prove 
most deadly in the upcoming conflict. 

Aerial Servants (3): AC 0; HD 16***; hp 80,

(360') flying; #AT 1; D 8-32; Save F16; 
ML 9; AL C; XP 3,250 

The aerial servants enter the characters' 
camp at maximum speed, steal the indicated 
items, and flee as quickly as possible. 

The fortress of Crystykk 

This fortress is located in a dark region of 
rocky peaks, far from any civilized lands. As 
characters approach the fortress, the trail 
they are following begins winding steeply 
upward. The characters must negotiate nar 
row canyons and high passes as they follow 
the trail. At last, the characters emerge on a 
wide ledge. Tell the characters that this area is 
the same as the one they saw in their dreams. 

When the characters get to this point, read 
the following boxed text to the players. 

A narrow , rocky trail winds upward to the 
mouth of a dark cave. Gray clouds hug the 


mountain peak that towers above this 
cave. Flashes of lightning seem to flicker 
dimly in the clouds. The sky above the 
mountain grows even darker. Suddenly , it 
is almost night. 

Tell the characters that the fortress they saw 
in their dreams was actually the mountain 
peak that now rises before them. 

The cave mouth is 20 feet wide. It opens 
into a dimly-lit, 50-foot-long tunnel. The 
tunnel is 10 feet wide and 20 feet high. The 
tunnel leads to large, circular cavern of rock, 
which is 100 feet in diameter. The rough walls 
of the cavern rise to a 20-foot-high ceiling. 
This cavern is the home of the crones. 

In the center of the cavern, a mirror is 
embedded into a raised block of stone. The 
crones' beds, and a few of their personal pos 
sessions stand against the cavern wall, across 
from the entrance. 

The characters encounter the crones in the 
entrance tunnel. 

The three crones 

Mequisa (Lawful), Bethidia (Neutral), and 
Chasandri (Chaotic) are the three crones that 
live here. While you are free to use them as 
simple NPC antagonists, they are intended to 
represent something more. 


These old women symbolize the balance of 
forces, or alignments, in the world. Their ori 
gin is obscure, but they are certainly very old. 
They are always together. You may want to 
use them in future adventures. If you do, 
adjust their spells and possessions, based on 
the passage of time.

Chasandri wears plate mail +2, a displacer 
cloak, a ring of spell turning (7 charges), and 
a ring ofmemory. She carries a mace +4 (dou 
ble damage to Lawful victims), and a shield 
+ 2 . 

Fighting the crones 

The crones, of course, know exactly when the 
characters enter their home. To prepare for 
the upcoming battle, the crones cast a few 
spells. Bethidia casts haste and conjure ele 
mental from her ring. The crones then cast 
bless, resist fire, protection from evil (10' 
radius), and truesight. These spells affect 
each crone. 

Just before the characters come into the 
entrance tunnel to the crones' cave, Mequisa 
casts a barrier spell at the end of the tunnel 
that leads into the cave. As soon as the char 
acters enter the tunnel, Chasandri casts 
another barrier spell at the tunnel's outer 
end. 

Chasandri immediately moves forward to 
attack the characters. The three crones stay 
as far apart as possible. They try to ensure 
that two of them do not get caught in the area 
of effect of a spell cast by a character. 
Mequisa sends her snake staffinto the fray 1 
round after Chasandri moves forward. She 
continues to cast spells as long as she can. 
Bethidia casts the anti-magic shell from her 
ring as soon as the battle begins, and then she 
too moves forward. 

When possible, the crones use. spells that 
allow demi-human characters no saving 


throws. (Ignore this guideline if there are no 
demi-humans in the characters' party.) The 
crones direct those spells that do allow saving 
throws at the party's human members. 

The crones fight to the best of their abilities 
in their battle with the characters. If charac 
ters kill two of the three crones, or if they have 
reduced each of the crones to 8 hit points or 
less, the remaining crones surrender. If the 
crones are winning the battle, they demand 
that the characters surrender, and they con 
tinue to fight until the characters do so. If the 
characters flee, the crones follow them. 

Battle results 

The crones have not staged this test because 
they enjoy bullying weaker characters. 
Rather, they enjoy the thrill of a tough battle. 
They are good sports about winning or los 
ing. 

After the battle is over, they make sure that 
all wounded characters are healed. If a char 
acter is killed in battle, the crones bring the 
character back to life. The crones use a rod of 
health and a staff of healing for these pur 
poses. 

If the characters lose: In this case, the crones 
claim the following "fruits" of victory: 

1. 1 magic item from each character 

2. 5 years' service by one character (char 
acters may share this responsibility-one 
character serves the crones for 6 months, and 
then another character takes over for 6 
months, etc.) 

The crones claim whatever magic item is 
most available. They probably choose the 
items stolen by the aerial servants. 

If characters must go to work for the ser 
vants, their jobs include cooking meals for 
the crones, cleaning their cave, and going 
after nuisance monsters that might show up 
in the the vicinity of Crystykk. If a character 
deserts while working for the crones, all three 
aerial servants chase the character. When 
they capture the character, they afflict him 
with some mild curse, such as warts. Charac 
ters who desert repeatedly may be punished 
more severely. 

If the characters win: The crones greatly 
respect any characters who are able to defeat 
them in battle. As a token of their respect, the 
crones offer the characters important knowl 
edge gained through their mirror. Of course, 
if the characters killed all of the crones, they 
must bring the crones back to life in order to 
gain this information. 

If one of the crones survives the battle, she 
returns to the characters all of the magic 
items stolen by the aerial servants. Then she 


turns to speak to the characters. Read the fol 
lowing boxed text to the players. 

"A fine and worthy lot of lords ye be! 'Tis 
as we thought when we made the call , and 
you've given us a jolly fight for our trou 
bles. 

"The land could do worse than fall 
under the likes of you. If she is not taken 
good care of, though, you 're likely to lose 
her. Even as we speak, armies hostile to 
you and your king there are landin'." 

The crone draws a tattered scroll from a 
niche in the cave wall. It is a map of 
Norwold. 

"Here," the crone says, pointing to the 
city of Landfall. "A large force bearing 
the flag of Thyatis has come ashore. 
They 're burning and plundering for now, 
my friends, but in a few days, they 'll be on 
the march. 

"Norwold is about to go to war. Thyatis 
has had her eyes on this land for a long 
time. Your king Ericall presents a problem 
to Thyatis, and they've decided it's time 
for a solution." 

The crone turns to the mirror, where a vision 
of an army mustering around a castle sud 
denly appears. The castle should belong to an 
NPC whose dominion borders on one of the 
character's dominions. The mirror shows 
that a considerable force is assembling at the 
castle. The crone turns to speak again. 

"Even those you thought were friends are 
taking a warlike road. The force you see 
here is intended for a treacherous attack 
on a neighbor's stronghold! Can you 
imagine such a betrayal?" 

The image in the mirror slowly shifts to 
a maritime scene. White sails crowd the 
picture, as a fleet that must be made up of 
hundreds of ships sails rapidly before a 
stiff breeze. 

"Here is the major threat, friends. The 
combined fleets of Thyatis are preparing 
to take your capital, the city you call 
Alpha. The fate of your king is in your 
hands, lords. 

"Prepare to fight for Alphatia, if you 
want to keep your dominions. Alphatia, 
that is what they call it now, eh? Old as I 
am, I remember an earlier, more honest 
time, when an empire could be called by 
its true name. Know ye, lords, the secret 
name of those you serve? Know ye, lords, 
that you fight for the crown of Atlantis?" 


27 




WAR OF THE CROWN: RUNNING CAMPAIGN BATTLES 



This section outlines the clash between the 
empires of Thyatis and Alphatia (or Atlantis, 
which is this empire's secret name). The war 
should break out while the characters are vis 
iting the crones of Crystykk (see Encounter 5 
in the Norwold Encounters section). 

Running this war is a complex job. You 
will have to keep track of all of the invading 
forces, making sure that the characters do not 
discover their movements, unless the charac 
ters come up with some means of learning 
such information. You must also represent 
King Ericall and his NPC allies. 

If you are resolving a battle in which both 
character and NPC forces are fighting 
together, you should probably let the charac 
ters run all of the Alphatian forces. You 
should then take charge of all Thyatian 
forces. Make sure your players do not abuse 
this privilege, however. For example, you 
should discourage characters from dispatch 
ing the entire Royal Army to guard one char 
acter's dominion while the city of Alpha falls! 

You will probably find it worthwhile to 
quickly sketch out an area map on a blank 
sheet of hex paper whenever armies move 
into the same hex on the Norwold map. Draw 
this map at a scale of 1 mile per hex. These 
maps do not have to be detailed. If you take 
the time to do such maps, however, you will 
probably find that battles take on much more 
tactical significance, and become much more 
exciting. 

You will know even before the war begins 
that battles will take place in certain areas- 
Regent Pass near Alpha, and an NPC 
dominion near the Thyatian Expeditionary 
Force's landing site. If you prepare maps of 
these areas in advance, you will save time 
during play, and you'll still be able to use all 
of the necessary details in resolving the bat 
tles. 

When running the War of the Crown, use 
1-week time units. When the war progresses 
to the point that armies are entering into bat 


tle more frequently, switch to 1-day time 
units. If there is a lull in the action, go back to 
1-week units. 

The battle forces 

The four types of forces involved in the War 
of the Crown are listed on the next page. The 
four forces are: Alphatian, Thyatian, Neu 
tral, and Character-allied. 

Alphatian forces are those loyal to King 
Ericall. These forces always go to war on the 
side of the king. They respond as soon as they 
receive the word to mobilize. 

Thyatian forces are always the enemies of 
the king. These forces begin the war by 
invading and attacking the king's forces. 
These forces include two armies from Thy 
atis, and the armies of three NPCs who 
betray the king and side with the invaders. 

Neutral forces are those who lived in 
Norwold before King Ericall came to power. 
These forces do not have a major interest in 
this war. See the guidelines on Activating 
Neutral Forces for details on how these forces 
may enter the war. 

Character-allied forces are the dwarf and 
barbarian forces that may be allied with the 
characters. Characters gain these forces as 
allies through certain adventure encounters 
(see Encounters 3 and 4 in the Norwold 
Encounters section for details). If they are 
willing, these forces mobilize as soon as the 
characters call for them. 

The characters' forces are not listed on the 
charts, because the characters must create 
these forces themselves. By the time the war 
starts, the characters should have set up 
forces in their dominions, since King Ericall 
is bound to send all of his dominions' forces 
into battle. 

The Battle Rating for each force is given so 
that you don't have to calculate it. Use the 
No. of Troops and Type listings to determine 
which modifiers apply when seeking a Com 
bat Result. 


Events of the Thyatian invasion 

The War of the Crown begins in late winter, 
at the same time the characters are visiting 
the crones of Crystykk. The forces of Thyatis 
begin mobilizing at this time. The Thyatian 
Advance Force lands at Landfall and attacks 
that city. Norwold dominion lords who have 
allied themselves with Thyatis move out 
immediately, attacking the nearest domin 
ions friendly to King Ericall within 1 week. If 
a character has sided with Thyatis, his 
dominion's forces also move out at this time. 

The Thyatian Expeditionary Force arrives 
in Norwold ld4 weeks later. This force lands 
just north of the Oceansend Marshes. Its first 
goal is to try to eliminate any isolated domin 
ions that are loyal to King Ericall. These 
forces eventually combine for a march on the 
city of Alpha. 

Running the war of the crown 

Alphatian strategy 

It is up to the characters allied with King Eri 
call to advise the king on how to counter Thy 
atis' invasion. If the characters have sided 
with the Thyatians, you should run all of the 
Alphatian forces. The characters may then 
run the Thyatian forces in battle, but they 
cannot deviate from the events of the Thy 
atian invasion of Norwold. 

Activating neutral forces 

If Alak Dool's force (consisting of ores, bug 
bears, and trolls) passes within one hex of 
either Leeha or Oceansend, the force in the 
affected city immediately mobilizes on the 
side of King Ericall. Alak Dool does not real 
ize that the residents of the two cities would 
react so strongly (and so negatively) to his 
force, so he makes no attempt to avoid cross 
ing through their areas. 

If a character's force attacks the city of 
Oceansend, King Yarrvik's force immedi 
ately sides with the Thyatian forces. This sit 
uation could come about in the following 
manner: 

When war breaks out, King Ericall imme 
diately dispatches four characters' forces to 
the city of Oceansend. He supplements the 
characters' forces with troops from the Royal 
Army, if the characters' forces number less 
than 2,000. The king sends them to Ocean 
send to intercept any hostile forces that might 
leave that city. 

As soon as the characters reach Ocean 
send, King Yarrvik and his force move out of 
the city to meet them. If a parley can be 
arranged, King Yarrvik tells the characters

that their troops must stay away from Ocean- 
send, as it is neutral territory. If the charac 
ters comply, all is well. If they do not comply, 
the Thyatians will have gained another ally. 

Stronghold garrisons 

Most of the forces involved in the War of the 
Crown start out from a stronghold some 
where in Nor wold. Army leaders are not 
likely to leave these strongholds unguarded. 

To determine the number of troops left in 
an NPC-controlled stronghold, roll ld4. 
Multiply the result by 10. This number rep 
resents the percentage of the force that has 
remained at the stronghold. Do not diminish 
the force's field strength. Consider the force 
to have extra troops reserved for defending 
strongholds.

Ending the war 

If the forces of Thyatis capture the city of 
Alpha, the Alphatian forces have 1 month to 
recapture the city. If they cannot do so, 
Norwold becomes part of the empire ofThy 
atis, and Alphatia's power in this part of the 
world is effectively destroyed. 

If Thyatis wins the war, Alak Dool 
becomes king of Norwold. If this occurs, 
Dool immediately goes to work eliminating 
any potential opposition to his rule. 

If, on the other hand, the forces of Alphatia 
rout all of the Thyatian forces, the empire of 
Thyatis is considered to have suffered a 
crushing defeat. Another war between the 
two empires would be very unlikely, at least 
in the next 50 years.

* Barkal leads a barbarian group of 
15,000 during the summer solstice. At other 
times of the year, his tribe numbers 900. In 
a crisis, however, he is always able to mus 
ter 3,000 barbarians from various tribes. 


still in Norwold when winter arrives, the 
empire ofThyatis withdraws its forces, and 
the war ends. If, however, Thyatian forces 
are besieging the city of Alpha at this time, all 
surviving Thyatian forces remain, and the 
war continues. If you wish, you may have 
relieving forces arrive from Alphatia the next 
summer. 

If Alphatia retains control of Norwold, 
King Ericall takes care to reward those who 
served him well. Lords who were courageous 
in battle, or who were helpful in planning 
battle strategy, might be given additional 
lands, or the king may bestow an exalted title 
upon them. If a lord failed to answer the call 
to arms, or if he was cowardly in combat, the 
king may strip that lord of his lands and ban 
ish him from Norwold forever. 



EPILOGUE: CONTINUING THE CAMPAIGN 



Nor wold should not cease to be a vital and 
interesting area once you have finished run 
ning the adventures outlined in this booklet. 
Norwold is a large and relatively unexplored 
land, and there is plenty of room for charac 
ters to explore the wilderness and expand the 
holdings of their dominions. 

Other Companion adventures will detail 
areas of Norwold for you and your players, 
but you may be able to use the information 
given in this booklet to create your own 
adventures. 

This section features several suggestions 
for continuing the campaign you have begun 
in this adventure. You may use all or any one 
of these scenarios in your campaign, depend 
ing on how they suit your characters. If a sce 
nario seems inappropriate to your campaign, 
you may want to use the scenario with a 
group of Expert-level players, or you may 
want to incorporate a few of the ideas sug 
gested by the scenario into your campaign. 

One factor that will influence your cam 
paign is the massive immigration to Norwold 
that begins soon after the War of the Crown. 
People of all sorts flow into the land, coming 
from all over the D&D* world in search of a 
better, more prosperous life. Keep your play 
ers informed of this development as the cam 
paign progresses. More residents in a 
character's dominion means more power for 
that character. 

Scenario 1: 

Dominion conflicts 

The dominions set up by characters in 
Norwold are not bound by static geographi 
cal limits. Rather, their boundaries are 
abstract political measurements that, for any 
number of reasons, may change over time. A 
character or NPC might get ambitious, and 
might try to encroach upon a neighbor's 
land. Lords might also make new alliances 
and break old ones. These factors all affect 
the power structure of Norwold's dominions. 

As trade flourishes between dominions, 
and between Norwold and other parts of the 


world, those dominions that hold strategic 
river or port areas will become increasingly 
powerful. Lords may impose tolls on those 
who use these transportation facilities; such 
tolls could become a major source of income. 
Who controls these strategic ports may 
become a bone of contention between domin 
ion lords. 

New characters or NPCs might also arrive 
in Norwold and try to squeeze new domin 
ions in between existing ones. This sort of 
"encroachment" is bound to create some 
hard feelings, and could even lead to a small- 
scale war. 

Scenario 2: 

Dragons of the Wyrmsteeth 

This rugged range shelters a tremendous 
number of dragons (see The Setting section, 
Special Geographical Features for details). 
As more people continue to move to 
Norwold, clashes between dragons and 
humans may become more frequent. Sooner 
or later, characters may find they must deal 
with the problem of the Wyrmsteeth. 

Scenario 3: 

The giants of Frosthaven 

While on one of their "normal" winter raids, 
the giants of Frosthaven may take hostage an 
extremely important member of the Norwold 
leadership (King Ericall's wife, for example) 
and carry that person back to Frosthaven. 

The characters could be charged with jour 
neying to Frosthaven and rescuing the hos 
tage. You may pose an extra problem by 
having this scenario occur just as the ice 
between Frosthaven and Norwold begins to 
break up. You may alter the scenario in other 
ways as well (setting a time limit, having 
NPCs introduce unusual obstacles, etc.). 

Scenario 4: 

Test of the crones 

The three crones of Cry sty kk (detailed in 
Encounter 5 of the Norwold Encounters sec 


tion) could become important NPCs in a 
long-running campaign. These old women 
are more than clerics. They serve as symbols 
of the balance of Law and Chaos that must 
exist in the D&D* world. 

You may have the crones submit the char 
acters to new, more challenging tests. Use 
these tests as a way of teaching the characters 
valuable lessons, or as a means of passing 
along important information. Remember 
that the crones' use of dreams could be a use 
ful tool for sending messages to the charac 
ters. The characters may also decide to go to 
the crones when they are confronted with an 
especially difficult problem. 

You need not have the characters battle the 
crones every time they visit the old women. 
Adjust these encounters based on the nature 
of your campaign. Keep in mind, however, 
that the crones give nothing away for free! 

Scenario 5: 

Beyond Norwold 

Your characters may want to explore some of 
the areas that surround Norwold. 

Characters may choose to explore the Isle 
of Dawn, which lies off the eastern coast of 
the continent. This isle is the scene of an 
ongoing conflict between the empires of 
Alphatia and Thyatis. 

Other areas that have yet to be fully 
explored include the inner sanctums of the 
Icereach Range, and the regions beyond the 
western edge of the Norwold map. 

Your characters may decide to explore 
these areas, or you may devise a clever 
scheme to draw them to a certain area. Your 
imagination is all that limits you! Imagine 
what kind of lost civilizations, bizarre mon 
sters, and weird magical phenomena might 
lurk just beyond the next horizon! 

The important thing to remember is that 
you should work to keep your campaign 
alive! People/characters change and grow as 
they experience life, whether in the real world 
or in a D&D(r) campaign. Your NPCs should 
also mature as the "years" go by. Remember 
that events and situations that bring charac 
ters together (or tear them apart) are usually 
not easily forgotten. 

The possibilities for adventure are truly 
endless, even on the corner of the map we 
have called Norwold. When you consider 
that there are other planes for your characters 
to visit, as well as the rest of the world (of 
which Norwold is only a small patch), then 
you should have no trouble keeping yourself 
and your players busy with one exciting 
adventure after another.
