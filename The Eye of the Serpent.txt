tear out sheet

skills of a druid, tanger or monk character. The routings are described on page 4. and NPCs. but only 
three of these should be

user. 


Alternatively, the module is suitable for a 
party of 4-6 first level adventurers. 


The adventurers are captured by a pair of 
rocs and deposited at the top of a mountain. 
Left alone for a while, they must escape and 
survive the harsh journey to the plain 
below, drawn on by the lure of the 
'Serpent's Eye'. 


Although the encounter areas are pre 
specified as usual, the wilderness terrain 
over which most of the adventure lakes 
place allows the possible routings between 
them to be changed to suit the party 
involved. Suggested routings for adventures 
to test a druid, ranger or monk have been 
provided, but DMscan have fun producing 
unique and interesting adventures by 
arranging the routings in their own way. 


HOW TO USE THIS MODULE 


This module uses a standard set of en 
counters which are linked together by 
routings which can be varied to 
change the adventure. 


The final choice of routings is up to the 
DM. but if the module is to be used to start a 
new druid, ranget or monk, it is suggested 
that the appropriate, standard set of rout 
ings is used. These standard sets arc given 
on page 4. 


II one of the standard sets is not used, the 
DM has the opportunity to shape the style, 
challenges, rewards and length of the 
adventure. Before doing this, the DM 
should read thecncountcr descriptions /l\ 
carefully, decide which ones would J"- 
be appropriate for the characters / An 
and players, and then choose a set ,. Kfj 

of routings which will provide //J Un

In this module, the statistics of monsters 
and non-player characters have been 
standardized. The information is given 
after the monster/NPCs name, as follows: 

AC = Armour Class; MV = Movement Rate; 
HD = Hit Dice (monsters) or Class/Lcvcl 
(NPCs - see below): hp = current hit points 
(figures in btackets are max. hit points of 
wounded creatures); AT = Number of 
Attacks: D = Damage Caused by Attacks; SA 
= Special Attacks; SD = Special Defences; 
MR = Magic Resistance; Ini = Intelligence 
(monsters and minor NPCs only); AL = 
Alignment; Ability Scores (major NPCs 
only - see below); Size (monsters and minor 
NPCs only); xp = Experience Points 
awarded for overcoming; THACO (see 
below): Source of further information. 

2 INTRODUCTION 


The following additional abbreviations 
are used: C= Cleric. D = Druid, F = Fighter. 
P = Paladin. R = Ranger, M = Magic User, 
I = Illusionist,T=Thief, A = Assassin. Mk = 
Monk. S = Strength, I = Intelligence, W = 
Wisdom, D = Dexterity, C = Constitution, 
Ch = Charisma. MM = ADffcD(tm) Monster 
Manual, MMH r AD&D Monster Manual 
II, FF = FIEND FOLIO(r) tome, PHB = 
Al)t-D Players Handbook. DMG = ADfcD 
Dungeon Masters Guide. 

THACO =To Hu Armour Class Zero. This 
is the roll on a d20 needed by a CTeature to 
hitan opponent with AC0(see DMG pl96- 
215). In most cases, the toll needed to hit 
other atmoui classes =THACO-AC. Some 
creatures, whose hit probability is very low. 
have been given THACO of 20*. and in 


these instances the DM should consult the 
relevant tables (see DMG p74-5) to find the 
rolls needed to hit other armour classes. 

Boxed Sections include that information 
which the characters would get from the 
first sight of an area or rtxrm. The DM may 
either paraphrase or read them out as 
written. In cases where player characters 
would instantly recognise the monsters 
seen, the DM should substitute the mon 
sters' namefs) for the description. 

Ability Checks: Sometimes rliarat ters must 
make dexterity or constitution cherks. To 
make a dextenty/constituiion check, char 
acters must roll theit dcxterity/cousliiut- 
ion ot less on a d20. The effects of the toll 
ate explained in each case. 


HARDWAY MOUNTAIN 


Most of this adventure takes place in a 
long, deep valley which winds down from 
the top of Hardway Mountain (see Map 1). 

On their way down from the top of the 
valley to the plain below, the adventurers 
will pass from a region of ice and snow (the 
ICE HEIGHTS), into an area of cool 
woodlands and marshes (the GRAFEN- 
VOL.K DALE), across a verdant green 
meadow (the BARROW SWARD) and 
finally through a mist-laden swamp (the 
SLOUGH MIRE) 

At the bottom of the valley, the river 
flows out into a grassy plain and 
meanders across it. eventually 
dropping over a waterfall into 
a dense forest below. Above 
the waterfall is a small 
lake and in the 
middle of this. 
Uw an island 



BACKGROUND 

Seen from the mountain, the river looks 
like a snake writhing across the plain with 
the lake for its head and the island for its 
eye. It was named the 'Eye of the Serpent' 
by the Grafenvolk dwarves - a clan which 
lived on the mountain in the wooded part 
of the valley (the GRAFENVOLK DALE). 

The dwarves built a cult around the 
Serpent River, arid chose the island as the 
site for an underground shrine (areas 39 
and 40). The entrance to the shrine was a 
concealed door of rock crystals behind a 
pool of everlasting flame (area 38). The 
reflection of sunlight from the crystals by 
day. and the light of the burning pool by 
night, ensured that from the dwarves' dale 
on the mountain, the Eye of the Serpent 
could be seen shining like a beacon. 

Before achieving adulthood, young 
dwarves would go up to the rock face above 
the Ice Heights in order to see the Serpent 
River and the Eye of the Serpent at their 
best. Theclun erected an obelisk near the 
pool of flame (see area 37) on which 
they set down the basic principles of 
their snake cult and described the 
treks up the mountain. 


The Grafenvolk lived by 
mining for gems and 
precious metals. When 
the mines were ex 
hausted and the 
clan began to 
crumble, the 
priesthood 


of the Cult of the Serpent tell under the 
influence of a group of duergar (evil 
dwarves) who hastened its downfall. Al 
though the dwarves have gone, theduergar 
linger on in dark chambers below the 
original temple (areas 42-48), where they 
hoard the remains of the dwarves' treasure. 

Some time later, the Kharg (a tribe of 
humans who by herd and train horses), 
came to the plain below the mountain. 
They found the island, the pool of flame 
and the stump of the obelisk but, knowing 
little of the dwarven tongue, they made a 
poor translation of the fragment of the 
inscription which remained (see area 37). 
They believe that the 'Serpent's Eye' (their 
interpretation of the 'Eyeof thcSerpent'lis 
a fabulous treasurcat the top of the mount 
ain. and they have never realised that there 
is a shrine beyond the flaming pool. The 
trilrc took the snake motif on the base of the 
obelisk as their symbol. Occasionally, men 
of the tribe go up the mountain in search of 
the 'Serpent's Eye' in order to prove 
themselves or to re-establish their honour 
after being convicted of some crime. None 
has ever returned, and the Kharg have 
named the mountain Hardway. 

From the nest, and during their flight toil, 
the adventurers will see the lie of the land, 
ini lulling the Serpent Rivet and the Eye of 
the Serpent. In the nest they will find a clue 
that great wealth is hidden on the island. At 
various points along their journey down 
the valley, the adventurers will see the 
Serpent River again. They will also find 
images of the writhing serpent (relics of the 
dwarves and Kharg adventurers). 


The slopes on either side of the valley 
running down Hatdway mountain ate very 
steep and the ten am lievond is impassable. 
Within the valley, movement is often 
restricted by rivers, lakes, swamps, nxk- 
faces and so on. The routes which go 
atuund. through ot across these ob-taclcs 
are shown on the main map, and many are 
described in the table on page 4. The DM 
should not make it unduly difficult for the 
adventurers to find these connecting routes, 
hut the terrain should lie used to discourage 
the characters from diverging off the tomes 
which have been selected. 

The climbing equipment available to the 
party (ropes, spikes and so on) will 
probably be limited. Ice-covered slopes are 
treated as 'smooth, but cracked - slip|x-ry' 


and normal rock slopes are treated as 
'somewhat tough - non-slipijefy' (DMG 
pi 9). 

The main river, except lor the rapids (see 
page 12) may be' fotdcd. but above the 
Geyser Lake (sec- page 9) the water is very 
cold and characters entering the river who 
are not magically protected must make a 
constitution check or suffer 1-2 hit points 
of cold damage from the crossing. Streams 
may all be folded easily and safely. 

Any characters immersed in the Ice Lake 
(see page 9) must make a ( (institution check 
each round or sufler 1-4 hit points of 
damage jmt round from cold unless they 
are magically protected. The Geyser Lake 
isalso very cold hut does not cause damage. 


The Weed lake is so choked with weeds 
that the characters will not be able to swim 
in it (see page 12). 

The swamps and marshes are very danger 
ous places. Characteis moving in them - 
except on paths or islands - must make a 
dexterity check each round or fall into a 
quagmire. Unless rescued, they will go 
mulct the surface after d4+2 rounds and 
drown 3 rounds later. 

Tin- weather during the adventure will br 
cocil and damp; olirn cloudy with occasion 
al light rain. Although their journey down 
the mountain will take several days, die 
characters will not normally have any 
problems finding food, water or places to 
camp.

FLIGHT TO THE NEST 


The adventure starts on a lonely country 
road, well away from any settlements, 
where the party of first level adventurers are 
carried off by a pair of rocs. The advent urers 
should be encouraged to travel along the 
road by means of a suitable (preferably 
false) rumour and should be allowed to 
equip themselves beforehand using what 
ever starting money they may have. If the 
module is being used to start a druid, 
ranger or monk character, only this adven 
turer needs to be equipped since the 
equipment of the three NPC companions 
(see HOW TO USE THIS MODULE - 
page 2) is fully detailed on the tear-out 
sheet (see NON-PLAYER CHARACTERS 

- pages 31 and 32). 

The rocs will attack the parly many miles 
from Hardway Mountain on an open 
stretch of road where there is nowhere to 
hide: 

> 1 > 

Soaring high above the clouds, two 
tiny, dark shapes appear. Soon, these 
become recognisable as birds - 
eagles perhaps, or even larger crea 
tures. Much larger! As they plummet 
towards you. mighty wings swept 
back, you realise to your horror that 
these are rocs: terrible beasts capable 
of carrying off even elephants and 
beyond the power of men to harm. 
Before you even have time to look 
around for somewhere to hide, the 
monsters are upon you. 

- 

It is intended that the rocs should capture 
the adventurers and carry them to the nest 
unharmed. The awesome power of the rocs 
should be obvious to the adventurers and 
the DM should give clear hints to the 
players that it would be (utile and danger 
ous to resist. The DM should have the rocs 
attack to injure only as a very last resort 
but, for the purposes of this adventure, 
their attempts to grab the adventurers will 
succeed automatically.

are swept aloft, higher and higher 
until the countryside below is laid 
out like a map. Mile after mile, the 
rocs' steady wing beats carry you 
towards whatever fate awaits, but for 
now you can console yourselves with 
the magnificent view and your for 
tune at still being alive. 

After some time, the open country 
gives way to a dense forest and 
beyond this a broad grassy plain, but 
it seems that the rocs' destination lies 
still further. Dead ahead, a dark 
snow-capped mountain looms up 
beyond the plain, flanked on either 
side by lesser peaks. 

Running like a gash down the 
mountain side, a deep valley sends 
forth a river onto the plain below, 
The river meanders through great 
loops until it forms a small lake, then 
drops over a ledge and disappears 
into the forest below. The river and 
lake remind you of the body and head 
of a snake, and the image is com 
pleted by an island in the lake like 
the snake's eye. Never faltering, the 
rocs carry you towards the mountain 
peak, following the course of the 
valley. At its mouth is a steamy 
marsh, above this a grassy meadow, 
woods and lake, and higher still are 
two more lakes, icy blue and bounded 
by snow-covered slopes. Finally, you 
come to the rocs' nest, perched on a 
rocky crag near the peak. 


I. Rocs' Nest 

The rocs will deposit the adventurers in the 
nest and then fly off: 

- 1 ¦ 1 > 

The nest is a massive structure of 
tangled trees and branches - there is 
even an old wagon and half a small 
boat incorporated into it! The centr 
al hollow, where you have been 
dumped, is carpeted with leaves and 
straw, and contains the sad remains 
ol the rocs' past victims - both 
animal and human. 

For a few moments, the rocs remain 
near the nest then, apparently satis 
fied that their captives are secure, 
they flap away into the distance. 


The rocs will not return to the nest for 4 
hours, but the DM should encourage the 
party to make haste to leave: 

---N 

As you watch them leave, your eyes 
are drawn down to the magnificent 
view from the nest. Spread out below 
you is the long valley, hemmed in on 
either side by towering walls of rock. 

Beyond the valley is the winding 
river. Shimmering in a shaft of 
sunlight which breaks through the 
clouds, it reminds you more than 
ever of a snake. Just for a moment, 
before the clouds close over, the light 
catches the island in the lake, which 
answers with a sparkling glint like a 
winking, inviting eye. 

^ ¦¦ * 

The nest contains the bones of the rocs' 
past victims. These were mostly cattle, 
horses and sheep, but there are also the 
splintered bones of a dozen humans and 
derm-humans. 

Theadvemurers will linda thin, crumpled 
sheet of copper with a neat inscription on it 
in the common tongue: 

TRIAL BY ORDEAL 

]1 SVREFOOT, HORSE THIEF. 
MURDERER. 

FEARING THE GUARDIAN 
OF THE ISLAND. YOU HAVE 
CHOSEN TO SEEK 
THE SERPENT S EYE 
ON HARDWAY MOUNTAIN. 
SUCH IS YOUR RIGHT. 

GO THEN. 

NOTHING BUTDEA TH OR THE 
SNAKE'S PRECIOUS JEWEL CAN 
GIVE YOU BACK 
YOUR HONOUR. 

ARN FLOWMANE, GUARDIAN 
OF THE ISLAND. 

Below the inscription is a stylised picture 
ol a writhing snake and, next to this, the 
following words have been crudely inscrib 
ed with the poini ol a dagger or similar 
implement: 

Evil old fool, death and honour have 
I found but the Serpent's Eye was 
yours all along! 

The copper challenge was carried by Ji 
.Surefoot, an unfortunate Kharg tribesman 
whose bones now lie mingled with the

others in the nest. It is illustrated below the 
players' map on the outside of the module 
folder. 

The only other items of use or value are: 

- a helmet (nun-magical) painted with 

gold and decorated with semi 
precious stones (value - 600gp). 

- a leather backpack containing: a 50-foot 

length of rope; a packet of dried food 
(the equivalent of one week's iron 
rations); a wine-skin lull of sout 
wine; a bag holding 50gp; a vial of 
holy water; and a ceramic bottle 
(labelled 'healing brew') containing 
one dose oi a potion ol healing (a 
colourless, odourless, tasteless liquid). 

- a silver dagger (value - 20gp); a long 

sword in a scabbard; a small wooden 
shield and a quiver holding 11 arrows 
(six with silver heads). 


After exploring the nest foi a short while 
(and preferably after they have found tin 
copper sheet) the adveuttiteis will notice 
that there is a rocky ledgeoulv lOfecl below 
the nest, offering the hope ol cm ape. 

The ledge below the nest is the top of the 
route down from area I shown on Map I. 
Once the adventurers have escaped from 
the nest, the rocs will not search for them, 
although the DM might wish to use an 
occasional glimpse of them flying high 
overhead as a means of encouraging haste 
in the party during the adventure. 

Views of the Serpent's Eye 

At various points of the descent down the 
valley, the adventurers will get further 
views of the Serpent River and the 'Eye of 
the Serpent' island shining like a beacon. 
When the party reaches each ol these points 
(listed below) the DM should take the 


opportunity to spur the adventurers on to 
their goal. No descriptions have been 
provided, but the DM should either create 
his own or paraphrase the one given above 
(area I). 

The river and island are visible: 

i) during the climb down from the nest 
(above Rl) 

ii) during the climb down from the ice 
mephit's cave (encounter area 6 - R7) 

iii) from the cliff edge at the bottom of the 
Ice Heights, as lai west as R9 and 
eastwards to RI3 

iv) from the eyrie of the Grafenvolk dwarves 
(encounter area 16) 

v) from the top of the cliff at the bottom of 
the Barrow Sward, where the river falls 
down into the Slough Mires 

vi) from the ledge overlooking the mouth 
of the Slough Mires, from where the 
river flows out into the plain 
(encounter area S3) 


- RANDOM ENCOUNTERS - 

The duration of the adventure depends on the route taken by the parly. To maintain the excitement of 
the adventure, however, 
it is preferable that the party makes good progress and the DM may wish to encourage this by the 
judicious use of random 
encounters. Suitable random encounters are described below.

ICE HEIGHTS 

(Encouter Areas 2-8: Map 1) 



Once ihe adventurers 
ledge below the rocs' nest, they must 
negotiate the rock lace below. Tire rock face b 
is very sleep and is generally free of snow or 
ice. At the bottom they will be faced with 
the upper part of the river valley; a bleak 
wilderness of ice, snow and rock. This part 
of the valley is divided in two by an ice-cliff, ~ 
over which the river falls. 

The valley floors are generally snow- 
covered, with occasional patches of bare 
rock or tough grass. The slopes above the 
valley arc a treacherous combination of ice 
and vertical rock faces. 


Ice Lake 

This is the source of the river, and is fed by 
streams which cascade from the ice-bound 
peaks above. The water is bitterly cold (see 
GENERAL NOTES - page 3) and ice has 
formed over the shallower parts (R2. R3 
and area 5). 


Geyser Lake 

This lake feeds the waterfall which drops 
into the wooded dale below. It is a few 
degrees warmer than the upper lake, since 
it receives the outflow from the geyser (area 
7), and the narrow paths on either side of it 
arc free of snow. Even so, the waters feel icy 
cold. 


River and Streams 

Between the cliff and the lower lake, the 
river is fast-flowing and very cold (see 
GENERAL NOTES - page 3). The streams 
flowing into the river and the lakes are all 
narrow and may be forded easily. 


ENCOUNTER AREAS 


2. Vilstrak Attack 


A vilstrak is hiding by the mountain ledge 
(which is about 15 feet wide), waiting to 
attack creatures passing by. There is only a 
25% chance that it will be noticed before it 
attacks and the following description 
assumes that it has not been spotted 
(otherwise the DM must amend the des 
cription accordingly); 


Jutting abruptly out of the rock face, 
the wide ledge leatls you onwards - 
channelled between the blam lied sky 
above and the snow-covered valley 
below - unable, for the moment, to 
go up or down. At least the ledge 
seems safe, solid and unyielding. But 
then a boulder breaks away from the 
rock face and topples towards you, 
transforming as it does so into the 
rough shape of a pouncing man. 


The vilstrak will fight until killed, since it 
has no hope of escape on the narrow ledge.

Its lair is inside a large, hollow boulder, 30 
yards further along the ledge, and a ranger 
has the usual chance of following the 
creature's tracks back to it. 

Just where the tracks disappear into the 
boulder, the rock is very thin and may be 
smashed through easily with blunt wea 
pons. Inside the boulder is a roughly 
spherical cavity (6 feel across). Here, the 
adventurers will find some chewed animal 
bones, a dozen pretty pebbles and rocks (no 
value), a nuggci of gold (value - 20gp) and a 
fine, unadorned, metal shield +1 (large).

3. Snow Cal 

As they descend this snow-bank towards 
the upper lake, the adventurers will be 
attacked by a hungry snow lion: 

* ' 

Asleep beneath an even blanket of 
pure white snow, the land is still. 
Apart from the icy wind and the 
scudding clouds, nothing stirs - or 
does it? Out of the comer of your eye 
you seem to catch a movement. What 
had seemed an innocuous white 
shape resolves itself into a large, 
crouching white cat. Without warn 
ing it springs forward and bounds 
towards you in a flurry of scattered 
snowflakes. 


The snow lion (simply a white-furred 
breed of mountain lion) is well camou 
flaged, and will not be noticed until it is 
only 20-50 yards (d4+1 x 10) from the party. 
Its aggression is a result of its hunger and it 
will break off its attack if any meat is 
thrown to it before it reaches the party. If it 
succeeds in killing a character, it will fight 
to the death. Otherwise it will flee if 
reduced to 7 or fewer hit points and, with 
its speed and agility, will soon shake off 
any pursuit. 

The snow lion has no treasure but its pelt 
would be worth 50gp.

4. Musk Oxen 

This small herd of musk oxen is foraging 
in a steep-sided valley. Its only exit is 
towards the lake: 

' ¦ - 

On one side, a small, steep-sided 
valley leads away from the lake. The 
blanket of snow is thinner here, 
allowing a few patches of wiry grass 
to show through. At the far end, 
some shaggy musk oxen are grazing. 
They see you, and bellowing cries 
echo across the valley. The females 
usher their calves into a defensive 
group, while the bulls glare at you, 
stamping their hooves and snorting 
clouds of breath into the air. 


The beasts are not aggressive, but as long as 
they are cornered in this side valley, they 
will defend themselves if threatened. 

If the adventurers ignore the oxen they will 
not be attacked, but the bulls will become 
increasingly agitated if approached and 
will charge the adventurers if the party 
moves to within 20 yards or attacks with 
missile weapons. In this event there is a 20% 
chance that the whole herd will stampede 
(see MM pi4). Magical attacks will cause 
the males to charge only if the party is the 
obvious source of whatever befalls the 
oxen. 

The females and young will only fight in 
self-defence and then as a last resort.

The oxen have no treasure, of course, but 
their flesh is very good to eat if it is cooked. 


5. Ghoul under the Ice 

The southernmost part of the lake is 
covered by a sheet of ice. This ice is, in 
itself, safe to walk upon, but a lacedon 
(marine ghoul) lies beneath it and will 
burst through it to attack when the 
adventurers reach the narrow, central 
portion of the ice sheet: 
- - 

The unyielding ice is slippery be 
neath your feet but thankfully shows 
no signs of giving way under your 
weight. 

Then, without warning, there is a 
loud crack, and you are showered 
with flying shards of ice as the sheet 
before you bursts upwards and a 
man-like beast leaps free of the water. 

Its long, blackened talons claw the 
air and, with a hideous leer, the 
creature lunges towards you. 

- 


The water below the ice at this point is 3 
feet deep. The lacedon was easily able to 
burst through a part of the ice which it had 
scraped thin but the surrounding ice is 
perfectly sound. The lacedon will fight 
until destroyed, unless it is turned. If 
turned, it will attempt to dive back through 
the hole in the ice in order to escape from 
the party. 

1 lacedon (marine ghoul): AC 6; MV 9";

SA Paralyse; SD Immune to sleep, charm 
etc.; MR Std; Int Low; AL CE; Size M; 
xp 77; THACO 16; MM • ghoul. 

The lacedon is dressed only in fragments of 
rusty chain mail and is wearing two gold 
bracelets (value - 40gp each) which are 
decorated with silver inlaid in the form of 
writhing snakes. 

Clearly visible on the lake bed below the 
hole in the ice is the remainder of the rusted 
chainmail armour and a dagger in a 
decorated scabbard. The scabbard will (all 
apart at a touch, but the gems with which it 
was decorated are worth a total of 150gp. 
The dagger has remained undamaged by 
time since it is a magical dagger +1 (+2 vs. 
small creatures). 


6. Egg in the Pool 

In a cave of ice atop this mountain spur, an 
ice mephii guards the egg of a remorhaz: 


Sheltered from the dagger-sharp 
wind, the freezing atmosphere of this 
flaw less ice cave seems a 1 most br it tie. 

In the centre of the cavern is a pool 
and on the far side, illuminated by a 
faint blue glow from the depths, 
crouches a winged figure. Pale, 
translucent and angular, it might 
well have been carved from ice. 

¦ 

The ice mephit will not remain still for 
long. As soon as it sees the party it will 
swoop over the pool and attack. Although 
wounded by an encounter with the steam 
mephit (area 7), the ice mephit will 
perform its duty by protecting the remor 
haz egg with its life (see below and area 7). 
It has no personal treasure.

10 ICE HEIGHTS (Encounter areas }-6) 







The ice inephit will always be unsuccessful 
if ii attempts to gate in other mephits. 

The pool of water is perfectly clear and is 
kept just above freezing point by the heat 
from a remorhaz egg lying at its bottom. 
The pool is 9 feel deep. Its sides are ice, but 
the bottom is the rock of the mountain. 
The egg is resting on a bed of tiny gems 
(fragments of blue quartz, total value ¦ 
1 lOgp) in a shallow depression in the rock. 


6) to hatch prematurely, by removing it 
from its icy pool. Its first attempt at this 
resulted only in its being wounded and 
driven off by the ice mephit sent to guard 
the egg. Since then the steam mephit has 
been using its ability to create rainstorms of 
boiling water to undermine and collapse 
the ice cave, release the egg, and perhaps 
even kill the ice mephit. However, such an 
event is still many days away. 


There is a faint sound, like rushing 
water at a great depth. At first you 
can barely hear it, but it rises steadily 
and then bursts into an explosive 
whoosh as a cloud of steam bellows 
out from a side valley some distance 
ahead. The noise and steam continue 
for almost a full minute and then 
stop abruptly. 


The egg is about 18 inches long, pale blue 
in colour and emits a faint blue light. If it is 
removed from the chilling effects of the 
water, it will begin to glow more brightly. 
Three rounds later, it will hatch to reveal a 
small remorhaz which will attack the party 
fearlessly, although the adventurers will 
automatically gain initiative in the first 
round of combat: 

~ ' - 

The egg pulses with an eerie, blue 
light which grows stronger by the 
second. Fine cracks appear, spread 
ing rapidly across its surface, and 
suddenly a small, voracious, winged 
reptile is released into the world. 
Hungrily, it rears up and lunges 
towards you... 


The remorhaz is far too small to swallow 
victims whole and does not yet have the 
power to cause its back to become danger 
ously hot. It has no treasure, but the glass 
like shell of its egg will continue to glow 
indefinitely (although not very brightly) 
and could be sold to a jeweller for 50gp.

Size S (about 3' long); xp 281; THACO 13; 
MM (variant). 

The remorhaz had been prevented from 
hatching by the chill of the pool, and the 
ice mephit had been sent to the prime 
material plane to tend to the pool and to 
protect the egg until its hatching would 
best suit the purpose of the mephit's 
master. The steam mephit (area 7) has been 
attempting to foil this plan. 


7. Steam Mephit 

Between forays to the ice cave (ste below 
and area 6), the steam mephit basks in the 
water of a geyser. The adventurers will be 
aware of the geyser long before they meet 
the mephit. however; 


The geyser erupts every 10 rounds, and the 
DM should point out this regularity to the 
players as the party approaches it. The 
adventurers will see the steam mephit 
when they reach the mouth of the side 
valley; 

No ice or snow clings to the side of 
this short, rocky gulley. Here the air 
is warm and steamy, heated by a 
bubbling pool of water barely 20 
yards away. Half-submerged in the 
pool, enveloped by steam, a grey, 
winged figure glares at you threaten 
ingly. 

- 

The steam mephit will only engage in 
melee with the party if forced so to do. 
Otherwise it will try to avoid combat and 
will attempt to delay the adventurers so 
that they will be caught by the next burst of 
the geyser (sec below). 

The mephit will not pursue the adventurers 
if they flee from the valley but will try to 
escape (never to be seen again) if reduced to 
5 or less hit points. The steam mephit 
cannot use its rainstorm of boiling water 
against the party as it has already used this 
ability today, attempting to undermine the 
ice cave (see below). Like the ice mephit 
(area 6), it will always fail in attempts to 
gate in other mephits. It has a platinum 
band around its neck (value - 70gp).

The geyser gives a full round of warning 
(in the form of the noises described above) 
before erupting. Characters within lOyards 
of it when it blows will suffer 1-10 hit 
points of damage from boiling water and 
steam. This damage is halved if the victim 
makes a successful saving throw vs. Breath. 

The steam mephit was sent to this plane to 
cause the remorhaz egg in the ice cave (area 


8. Koalinth Trap 

A lone koalinth lives in the shallow waters 
of the lake edge. He has set a trap on the 
narrow (10-foot-wide) lakeside path: 


Suddenly, the ground which only a 
moment before had looked firm and 
safe, tills violently to one side, 
sending you sliding towards the 
dark, cold waters of the lake. 


Under norma) circumstances the adven 
turers have only a 10% chance of noticing 
the trap. It consists of a large (10-foot-wide 
by 15-foot-long), delicately balanced slab 
of rock concealed by a tangled growth of 
vegetation. When the characters step on it. 
the rock lilts violently towards the lake. 
Characters must make a dexterity check or 
overbalance - into the lake which is 3 feet 
deep at this point. They will then be unable 
to act for I round while they regain their 
footing. 

The koalinth will be hiding beneath the 
water, and will attack when the trap is 
sprung, concentrating on any elves or on 
those characters in the water.

If the koalinth is badly injured (reduced to

will do so in order to escape. 

The koalinth came to this unlikely place as 
an outcast from his tribe. He was a leader, 
and still wears the gold armbands of office 
(three on each arm, value - 30gp each). His 
spear is made of bone inlaid with mother- 
of-pearl (value - 40gp), and he is wearing a 
ring of warmth. Attached to his belt is a 
silver amulet in the form of a writhing 
snake which the koalinth took from a 
young Kharg tribesman. 

ICE HEIGHTS (Encounter areas 7-8) 11 







This section of the valley is noticeably 
warmer than the snow-bound slopes above, 
since it is at a lower altitude and the river 
has been warmed by the geyser (area 7) 
above the waterfall. 

Many years ago, the dale was the home of 
the Grafenvolk dwarves. They arc long 
since gone, and other creatures occupy 
their old domain, but the remains of their 
works can still be seen (areas 14, 16. 19, 21 
and 22, and routes R16. R19, R20 and R21). 

The surrounding mountain slopes on 
either side are steep, with nolhing but 
sleeper, impassable slopes and peaks be 
yond. Movement in the dale is restricted by 
the slopes, the marshes, the lake and the 
river which flows out from it. 


The Weed Lake 


the party wading or swimming through 
any part of the fake. Over most of the area 
of the lake the weeds will not impede a raft 
or boat. Near where the river flows out of 
the lake, however, they are particularly 
dense and grow right up to the surface, 
preventing the passage of boats or rafts 
from the lake to the river. 

Standing on a rocky islet in the lake is an 
ancient, battlernented refuge which may be 
seen from many parts of the dale (see area 
14). 


The Wood 

The wood consists mostly of conifers with 
some mixed hardwood trees. The light 
undergrowth docs not impede movement. 
Druids will be able to find oak or holly 
leaves without difficulty, but mistletoe 


other growth. The tracks drrough thr 
marshes may be followed safely with 
caution (e.g. by prodding with a pole). The 
DM should hint at the dangers of leaving 
the paths, and characters deliberately doing 
so must make a dexterity check every round 
or lose their footing and fall into a 
quagmire. Here, they will be quite helpless. 
Unless rescued, they will go under thr 
surface after d-1+2 rounds and drown 3 
rounds later. 

Visibility in the marshes is poor, especially 
below the falls where the cool air descend 
ing from the valley above causes mists to 
gather. 

The River 

Between the lake and the rapids, the river is 
fast-flowing but may be crossed safely. It 


GRAFENVOLK DALE 

(Encounter Areas 9-22: Mu/> I) 


The lake is only 40 feet deep at the most and 
has <i gently sloping bottom. Despite the 
clarity of the water, the bottom cannot be 
seen even at the edges (where it is only 
about 2 feet deep) since the lake is choked 
with weeds. These will prevent members of 


may only be found in one place (area 17). 

The Marshes 

These treacherous meres are covered by a 
tangled mass of warped trees, bushes and 


forms rapids in the narrow gorge at the 
lower end of the valley (R18). Characters 
falling into the rapids, attempting to swim 
in them or trying to navigate a boat or raft 
through them, will Ire swept through to the 
quieter water beyond and will sulfei 3d6 hit 
points of damage.

Grass and Insects 

The grass around encounter area 15 is very 
tough and about 8 feel high. It restricts 
visibility to only a tew feet. When the 
adventurers enter this area, they will be 
plagued by swarms of mosquitoes and 
other insects, which are completely harm 
less although they will cause considerable 
discomfort and irritation. 

ENCOUNTER AREAS 

9. Blood Hawks 

A pair of blood hawks have a nest 
overlooking (he ledge, and will attack 
when the adventurers are directly beneath 
them. As they approach this point (within 
30 feet), the adventurers will notice some 
small bones of humanoids and animals 
(the remains of the blood hawks' past 
meals): 

-N 

The ledge narrows and you become 
even more conscious of the precip 
itous drop to the valley below. A 
screech from overhead causes you to 
look skyward just in time to see two 
shapes swooping towards you, each 
an angry riot of beak, feathers and 
talons. 

- 

The blood hawks have been denied the 
pleasure of human or humanoid flesh 
recently. They will fight the parly until 
killed, choosing their targets at random 
each round.

THACO 18: FF. 

The blood hawk nest is in a small cleft, 30 
feet above the ledge. It may be seen easily 
from ihe ledge if looked for. For ihe 
purposes of < limbing, the rock face below 
the nest is fairly rough and non-slippery 
(see DMG pl9). 

The nest contains three amethyst gems 
(value - 80gp each) and a silver amulet 
shaped like a writhing snake (value - 5gp). 


10. Splanxty 

East of the main falls from the Geyser Lake 
is a smaller waterfall, about 10 feet across. 
The climb down from the Ice Heights 


crosses the waterfall and descends next to it 
on the western side for about 70 leet before 
re-crossing and descending towards the 
east. The small waterfall is the home of a 
splanxty: 


Just this side of the broad falls which 
plummet from the lake above, is a 
gentler cascade. Its crystal waters 
split and recombine, spilling over 
rocks to fall splashing into swirling 
pools below - there to spill and fall 
again. Your path leads towards the 
waterfall. As you draw near, a slim 
woman rises smiling from one of the 
pools, her hair and robes flowing as 
if formed from the tumbling water. 


The woman is an illusion created by the 
splanxty which is hiding in a small pool 10 
feet above the path's upper crossing of the 
waterfall.

special: SA Special: SD Special; MR 30%; 
Ini Very: AL CN; Size S: xp 137: 
THACO 16; New monster (see page 30). 

As the adventurers draw near, the woman 
will hold up her hand to indicate that they 
should stop, and recite this riddle: 

Young as spring, old as time, 

Often falls, cannot climb, 

Always rushing, never still, 

In a bed, never ill. 

A correct answer would be "river", 
"stream", "waterfall" or something simi 
lar. The voice is that of the splanxty 
(projected by ventriloquism) who will give 
the party three guesses at the answer, 
repeating the riddle if the adventurers give 
a wrong answer. If the adventurers fail after 
three attempts, the image will demand a 
toll of three gems which are to be thtown 
into the waterfall. 

If the adventurers solve the riddle or pay the 
toll, the woman will appear to dissolve 
back into the water and the party will be 
free to continue. Even so. the splanxty will 
animate the waterfall to splash the adven 
turers annoyingly as they cross the water 
fall, descend beside it and cross again. 

If the adventurers disbelieve ihe illusion, 
ignore it or attack it. or if they do not solve 
the riddle and refuse to pay the toll, the 
splanxty will animate the water to attack 
rather than annoy. It will become so 


agitated that it will jump up and down in 
its pool and will no longer be hidden. 

If it is threatened personally, the splanxty 
will defend itself with its bow and animated 
water, transporting itself through the 
water to confuse its attackers. It will flee, 
never to be seen again, if reduced to 6 or 
fewer hit points. 

In the pool where the splanxty was 
originally hidden are six azurite gems 
(value - 25gp each). 


II. Rocky Gulley 

Some bowlers live amongst the scree and 
rocks on the lower slopes of this 30-foot 
wide gulley. When the party passes below 
them, the bowlers will start a small rock- 
slide and roll down to attack: 

¦ - 

This narrow, dry, barren gulley 
seems once to have been a river bed, 
but now your footsteps echo from the 
bare, rock-covered slopes. There is a 
low rumbling noise and all at once a 
mass of loose rocks on the western 
side begins to slide towards you. 

- 

The rocks and scree will reach the adven 
turers in the first round after they hear the 
noise. Each adventuier must make a 
dexterity check or suffet d4 hit points of 
damage. In the next round the five bowlers 
will reach the party and attack. Each of 
them has, at its core, a beryl gem worth 
I5gp.

12. Valley of Bones 

This gorge is the home of a gambado. If 
approached, it will attack viciously: 


The floor of this dismal gorge is 
littered with bleached bones and 
hollow skulls. You can recognise the 
remains of goats, wolves and even 
some humans, but there is nothing to 
show what fate befell them. 


Tlie scatter of bones extends for about 50 
feet along this 20-fool-wide gorge. The 

GRAFENVOLK DAUr. (Encounter arras 9-12) 13 









gambado's head resembles a goat's skull. 
Its lair is in the centre of the gorge near the 
southern end of the gruesome debris. If any 
of the characters approach to within 4 feet, 
it will launch itself to attack but will retreat 
into its hole if reduced to 6 or fewer hit 
points.

THACO 15; FF. 

Hidden in the gambado's pit are a gold and 
crystal ink bottle (empty, value - lOgp) and 
60gp. Nearby are four other gambado pits 
which will be found automatically il they 
are searched for. Their former occupants 
are dead. Three are empty but the other has 
a cache on one side containing 30sp and a 
gold ring with a turquoise stone (value - 
30gp). 

There are five human skulls in the gorge, 
all from Kharg tribesmen. Most of their 
gear has long since rotted or rusted away, 
but there is a bronze brooch (value - Igp) in 
the form of a curling snake. This will be 
found automatically il the area is searched. 


13. Muckd wellers 

The marsh is dank and misty. If a ranger 
examines the ground along any of the safe 
routes through it, he or she will find the 
tracks of muckdwellers leading in both 
directions. In their resting area, the muck- 
dwellers feel secure from attack. Unless the 
adventurers make their approach known 
(by making loud noises, (or example), the 
muckdwellers will be resting and will not 
surprise them: 

' ¦ 

The marsh is a little less boggy here, 
but still you must peer hard through 
the clinging mist to see the way 
ahead. A breath of wind clears the 
mist for a moment, and reveals half- 
a-dozen or more lizard-like creatures, 
squatting on their hind legs and 
hissing in a coarse, inhuman tongue. 

- 

When the two groups meet, twoof the eight 
muckdwellers will squirt jets of muddy 
water at the eyes of the adventurers - one 
target each - chosen at random. The 
effects of these jets are descri bed in Monster 
Manual D. The other muckdwellers will 
rush forward to attack with their fangs. 
The muckdwellers are not brave and when 
five or more have been killed, the survivors 


will attempt to flee into the marsh (where 
the adventurers will not be able to follow 
them).

The muckdwellers were resting against an 
old ash tree, and there are chewed fish 
bones scattered all around. Leaning against 
the base of the tree is a 2-foot-high wooden 
statuette of a lizard man (value - 5gp). This 
was stolen from Swtlbosh, the lizard man 
who lives on the island in the lake (see area 
14). The tree is hollow and contains the 
muckdwellers' hoard: 50gp worth of mixed 
coins, a broken gold bracelet (value - 40gp), 
a coil of silver wire (value - 30gp) and a 
thin, crumpled piece of copper sheet. 
Scratched on this are a picture of a snake 
and the name 'Eli Sweeigrass'. 

The muckdwellers' lair is in the lake and 
may not be found by the adventurers. 


14. Island in the Lake 

A lone lizard man, named Swilbosh, lives 
in this island refuge built by the dwarves 
but abandoned many years ago. Until 
recently he had been on good terms with 
the muckdwellers (see area 13) but since 
ihey stole one of his beloved wooden 
statuettes, open hostility has existed be 
tween them: 

Perched on a rocky islet amid the 
weed-tangled lake, is a grim, battle- 
mented building. Its ancient stones 
are stained and moss-covered, and 
the timbers of the stockade extending 
from one side are rotten. A grey 
figure paces the battlements as if on 
look-out duty but it does not seem to 
have noticed you. 

¦ 

The figure on the battlements is the 
phantom of one of the stronghold's former 
dwarf occupants. When the adventurers are 
able to see it clearly (that is, if they 
approach to within 60 feel) they must save 
vs. Spells (at -2) or panic as if affected by a 
fear spell. The fear of the phantom keeps 
the muckdwellers at bay.

THACO N/A; MMII. 



a. Courtyard 

The timber stockade is 6 feet high. The 
wood is sound but the gates have fallen flat: 


The years, neglect and weather have 
all taken their toll on this place. Yet 
it seems dial somebody has been here 
recently - somebody with a grim 
mission - since two fresh, scaly 
hides hang limply from a hook 
beside the door of the building. 


Tile hidesare from muckdwellers and were 
hung up by Swilbosh, who killed them. 
There is a 5-foot-deep pit trap at the foot of 
the steps leading up to the door. 

b. Old Guardroom 

I bis is Swilbosh's food-store: 


Dried fish, more dried fish and yet 
more dried fish 1 From lloor to ceiling 
and from wall to wall this room is 
crammed with wooden racks hold 
ing hundreds of fish and eels, all 
neatly slit and dried. 


On the far side of the room, obscured by the 
racks of fish, is a locker and a ladder. 

The locker contains five old light cross 
bows (only one ol which is usable), and 
dozens of quarrels (40 are usable). The 
ladder leads up to a trapdoor in the ceiling, 
which opens onto the battlemcuted roof of 
the building. A phantom (for details set- 
above) paces the battlements.

c. Stairs 

The stairs are trapped. There is a trip wire 
behind the door at the lop of the stairs, 
which will trigger a heavy crossbow 
mounted at the foot. The quarrel from the 
crossbow has the same chance of scoring a 
hit as a 2 hi t dice monster (i.e. a TH ACO of 
16) and a hit will inflict 2-5 hit points of 
damage. 

d. The Boathouse 

Unless the adventurers silence their move 
ments from the time they first enter the 
building. Swi I bosh will hear them and will 
be hidden in the small dock, behind the 
boat (if he is taken unawares. Swilbosh will 
be seated at the table, carving a statuette 
from a block of wood): 


The door swings open, and you are 
met by the gaze of a horde of 
diminutive beasts - all poised to 
leap or strike. You brace yourselves, 
but surprise turns to relief as you 
realise that these are lifeless, wooden 
statues carefully arranged around the 
walls of this damp room. On a table, 
lies a half-completed carving, sur 
rounded by shavings - but of the 
sculptor there is no sign. 


Swilbosh is well-hidden (10% chance of 
being spotted) but can sec most of what 
happens in the room. He will jump out of 
the water to threaten anyone who interferes 
with his statuettes or to demand the return 
ol the statuette stolen by the muckdwellers 
(see area 13) if he sees it. Swilbosh has no 
desire to fight and will only attack in self- 
defence. to protect his works of art. or to 
ensure the safe return of the statuette from 
the muckdwellers. Swilbosh speaks the 
common tongue and. if the adventurers 
comply with his wishes, he will offer them 
food and shelter (one night only) and will 
warn them about the muckdwellers (area 
13) and the humanoids who have taken 
over the mine (area 19). 


a locker, several blocks of wood, a chair and 
a hammock. There is also a boat in the 
dock. 

There are 23 statuettes in all, representing 
various creatures living in the valley. There 
are two muckdwellers. a bloodhawk, three 
hobgoblins, two snakes, four crows, three 
deer, a hedgehog, two wild boars, a bat. two 
dogs and a couple of al-mi'raj. They are all 
2 feet high and worth 5gp each. 

The locker contains three flasks of cheap, 
poor-quality wine, a large pot of fish paste, 
a box of carving tools, a fishing line with 
hooks, a cloak, and a bag containing 35gp 
and a silver hatpin set with a garnet stone 
(value - SOOgp). The blocks of wood are for 
carving into statuettes at a later date. The 
table, chairs and hammock are unex 
ceptional. 

Swilbosh has hidden an emerald in a small 
silk bag (value - lOOOgp) beneath one of the 
floor slabs (noticed as a secret door). 

The timbers of the rowing boat have rotted 
through and it has sunk to the bottom of 
die pool. 


15. Snake-in-the-Grass 

Whichever route they take through this 
area of tall grass, the adventurers should 
always come across the old wagon, the 
chest and the snake which lives in it: 


Buzzing with insects and taller than a 
lull-grown man. the grass surrounds 
you likea sea. Just when it seems that 
the grass will never end, you come 
unexpectedly to a tiny clearing 
around an old, collapsed, open 
wagon. Its only visible contents are a 
rusted, iron-bound chest and some 
limp sacks. 


The chest is locked (but not trapped) and 
the lock mechanism has rusted solid. 
However, if the chest is lifted or moved, its 
contents will simply cascade out through 
the rotten bottom: five snake eggs, the 
remnants of several articles of clothing, a 
pile of coins (1400sp) and a small bag 
containing lour rings. Three of these arc 
silver (value - 2gp each). The fourth is 
made of gold and is a ring of protection +1. 

The sacks in the wagon are empty. 


16. Eyrie 

Here on the eastern side of the ridge, is the 
look-out tower from which the dwarves 
once viewed the world beyond their valley. 
The adventurers will Ire able to see the 
Serpent Rivet from here. 


Each square 
represents 
10 feet 



a. Courtyard 

The steps and tunnels from the main valley 
open into a courtyard below the look-out 
tower. If the adventurers appear to be about 
to enter the tower, the crows which live 
there will attempt to frighten them away:

If the adventurers can prove that they have 
killed the muckdwellers (the statuette will 
be sufficient proof). Swilbosh will also give 
them the emerald hidden under the floor 
slab (see below). 

In addition to the statuettes, the table and 
the carving tools, Swilbosh's room contains 


The wagon was abandoned here many 
years ago. Eventually its wheels rotted and 
it collapsed to the ground. Since then, the 
bottom of the wagon and the chest have 
also rotted, and a poisonous snake has 
made a nest inside the chest by entering it 
from below. It will attack anyone who 
interferes with the chest. 


You emerge onto a windswept plat 
form on the eastern side of the 
mountains. A bleak, squat tower, 
crafted from the stark rock of the 
mountain, looms at one end, its dark 
windows staring out over the jagged 
grey peaks and ridges which drop 
away to the south-east. Perched on 
the battlements, a flock of sinister 
crows regard you with bright, malic

b. Lower Room 

The door at the base of the tower is locked. 
The lock may be picked or the door may be 
smashed open (requires 30 hit points of 
damage); 

s 

Roused by thedraught from the often 
door, the dust of ages billows out 
from the darkness. 

When it clears, you can see several 
box-like shapes on the floor of the 
room beyond, their outlines softened 
by a thick layer of dust. No-one but 
yourselves has come this way for 
many years and, to judge by the 
skeleton slumped against one of the 
boxes, the last to do so met with an 
untimely end. 

- 

The dust lies about an inch thick on every 
level surface and, although harmless, will 
billow up in dense clouds as the adventur 
ers move around the room. 

The skeleton is that of a dwatf. and it has a 
rusty dagger lodged between its ribs. Its 
clothing consists only of rotten rags and 
mildewed leather. 

The dust-covered boxes are wooden lock 
ers; there are five in all. These lockets are 
all empty and are neither locked nor 
trapped. 

There is a concealed compartment, 1 loot 
square and 2 feel deep, in the western wall. 
It will be found automatically tl the walls 
are searched. It is trapped but not locked. 

When the compartment is opened, a 5-foot- 
square section of the floor in Iront of it will 
open up, dropping anyone on it into a 
10-foot-deep pit. In the bottom of the pit is 
a second skeleton, also of a dwarf. It is 
wearing leather armour and has a short 


sword. Lying by it is a set of thief's tools. 
All of this equipment is decayed and 
useless, but there are 15gp in the skeleton's 
belt pouch. 

The trap may be disarmed by means of a 
hidden catch (usual find/remove traps 
chance). 

In the concealed compartment is a wooden 
box. This nearly fills the cavity and must be 
pulled out before it can be opened. It is 
neither locked nor trapped and contains a 
fine tapestry (value - 200gp, encumbrance 
300gpequivalent) wrapped around a small 
silver mirror (value - 25gp). The tapestry 
depicts, in a stylised form, the view of the 
Serpent River from the tower. 

c. Watchroom 

The stairs up from the lower room are 
dusty and gloomy. The doors at lop and 
bottom are c losed but not locked: 


Once, it serins, this room was a warm 
refuge from the elements but now it 
offers you no comfort; the roof is 
mostly open to the sky. the windows 
are empty, windblown sockets and 
the furniture is ruined. Perched on 
the jagged ribs of the collapsed roof, 
the jet-black crows flap their long, 
ragged wings and caw menacingly. 


There will be three crows here (two 
ordinary and one huge), in addition to the 
survivors from the attack on the platform 
(area 16a). If the adventurers leave at once, 
the crows will uotattack. Otherwiscall the 
birds will fight to the death in defence of 
their home and their fledglings.

At first sight, the watchroom seems to 
contain nothing of value. The furniture (a 
table and four chairs) is ruined. The hearth 
Ls empty, and an empty chest Lies open 
under the western window. Beneath the 
chest, however, is a leather pouch, brittle 
with age, which contains several sheets of 
inscribed parchment. The writing on this 
is illegible, but on one sheet a drawing of a 
snake may be made out. 


The nows' nests are on the surviving 
timbers of the roof. Two of them each 
contain two defenceless fledglings. All five 
contain treasures of some kind: a gold 
earring (value - lOgp), a tiger eye gem 
(value - 25gp). some gold and silver thread 
(fragments torn from a tapestry - value 
I5gp), another gold earring (identical to 
the first) and an hematite stone cm a silver 
chain (value - lOgp). 


17. The Wood 

This part of the wood is home to many 
creatures and plants. Only a needleman 
and the bloodthorn which shares its lair are 
any threat to the adventurers. The party 
will encounter the needleman 3 rounds 
after entering the wood: 

-- 

The tall, straight trunks of the pines 
stand guard-tike around you. rank 
upon rank, broken only by occasion 
al clumps of other trees. Save for the 
birdsong, all is quiet, and the air is 
filled with the scent of pine. Nothing 
here seems threatening or out of 
place, but then, without warning, a 
gaunt, crouching figure springs from 
the cover of a large tree, its skin 
covered by a mass of bristling pine- 
needles. 


The needleman will flee (never to lx- seen 
again) if reduced to 6 or fewer hit points or 
if it is attacked with a spell or a magical 
weapon. Not even a ranger will be able to 
track down the fleeing creature.

SD Camouflage; MR Sub-Sid: Int Low; 
AL N; Size M; xp 186; THACO 15; FF. 

The needleman has a small, dirty, cloth 
|miuc h hanging on a thong around its neck. 
The pouch contains two perfectly formed 
pine cones (no value), a lump of amber 
with a fly embedded in it (value - H0gp)and 
eight mistletoe berries (these will count as 
borrowed mistletoe for the purposes of 
casting druidic spells) wrapped in a frag 
ment ol parchment. 

Although the needleman cannot lx- follow 
ed if it flees, a ranger will have a normal 
c hance of following the tracks which ir 
made on its way here from its lau. 

The lair is at the easiertt end of the rope 
bridge over the liver: 


16 GRAFENVOLK DALE (Encounter area 17) 







Ahead, you see a welcome break in 
ihe dark canopy of trees, and the 
sound of rushing water reaches your 
ears. Following the sound, you find a 
narrow gully with steep, moss-cover 
ed sides, cut by a clear, splashing 
brook. The gorge offers no prospect 
of an easy crossing, but just here it is 
spanned by a rope bridge, old and 
ivy-covered but intact. 


The gorge is 30 feet deep and its sides un 
treated as "rough - slippery" for the 
purposes of climbing (see DMG pl9). The 
rope bridge is old and rickety, but sale. 

The needleman's lair is a rough shelter 
leaning against the trunk of a gnarled oak 
near the eastern end of the bridge. Nearby 
are several horn wood and other hardwood 
trees. One of these, standing between the 
oak and the btidge. is a bloodthorn. It can 
reach characters attempting to use the 
brtdgeor enter the shelter, and it will attack 
using 1-4 tendrils each round until it 
and/or its five tendrils are destroyed.

The shelter is made of pine branches and 
contains a bed ol pine needles. Beneath this 
is a gold rod with a silver snake coiled 
around it (value- I20gp). The oak tree has a 
large growth of mistletoe (enough fot the 
casting of 30 druidic spells) but this must 
be treated as lesser mistletoe if cut by a 
druid (see PHB p51). 


18. Hunting Party 

Soon after the adventurers einei the western 
part of the wood(i.e. after 1-4 rounds), they 
will encounter a hunting party: 


A deer, its eyes wide with Icar, its 
flanks streaked with blood Irottt a 
deep gash, bursts from the under 
growth barely 20 yards away. For a 
brief moment it pauses, breathless 
and lathered with sweat, but the 
raucous blare of a horn and the 
baying of hounds ftotn the direction 
whence it came stirs the unfortunate 
beast to flight once more and it 
disappears into the undergrowth. 


Moments later, a hobgoblin and his three 
hunting dogs will appear (25 yards from 
the party) in hot pursuit of the deer. The 
dogs will attack the adventurers while the 
hobgoblin remains at a distance, firing his 
bow. He will join the melee after 2 rounds. 
The dogs will flee (never to be seen again) if 
the hobgoblin is killed. If the dogs are 
killed, or if he is wounded, the hobgoblin 
will flee.

The dogs have no treasure, but the hob 
goblin has4gp ilia pouch hanging around 
his neck, a silver box (originally a snuff 
box) set with obsidian stones (value - 80gp) 
and a key to the chest in the old mine (area 

19b). 


19. Abandoned Mine 

The mine was built by the dwarves, but is 
now occupied by three goblins (area 19b). 
These are wor king and will not notice the 
approach of the party unless it is made 
obvious. 



a. Outside the Mine 

There is a grassy, open space between the 
wood anti the foot of the cliff: 


Beyond the wood, a pleasant green 
sward extends to the base of a 
lowering grey cliff. Rough stone 
steps lead up the cliff face to a tightly 
shut stone door. Above this a narrow 
crack in the rock lets forth a meander 
ing plume of grey smoke. To the left 
of the door you ran see a dark hole, 
evidently the entrance to a mine, 
since a spoil-heap of small rocks is 
banked against the cliff below it 


The faint sound of hammering from the 
forge (area 19b) will be heard, if the 
characters listen carefully. Also, if the 
ground below the stairs is examined, the 
adventurers will find signs of recent habit 
ation (cooked bones, apple cores, broken 
nutshells and so on). 

The mouth of the tunnel to the left may be 
reached easily by climbing the spoil-heap 
below it. However, the tunnel beyond 
(R19) may be blocked by a rockfall. 

b. Forge 

The goblins will be working at their 
hearth: 


As you push open the door, smoke 
and hot air billow out from the room 
beyond which is illuminated only by 
the red glow ol a bulky central 
hearth. There is a hoarse cry of auger 
and surprise and three goblins lunge 
at you from the semi-darkness. 


If the goblins gain initiative in the first 
round of combat, or if the adventurers do 
not close to melee range, one of the 
creatures will hurl a shovelful of hot coals 
at the party from the hearth. Any character 
within 20 feet of the hearth and in a 10-foot- 
wide area will suffet 1-2 hit points of 
damage Irom the coals unless they make a 
successful saving throw vs. Breath, in 
which case die damage is negated. The 
goblins will fight to the death.

Each of the goblins has a belt pom h. These 
contain 12gp, 8gp and 5gp respectively. 
One ol them also has a whetstone with a 
gold mount (value - 25gp). In addition to 
the health, the room contains a table, six 
stools, lout mattresses and a chest. 


CRAFENI'OLK DALE t Encounter areas IS-lh 17 










Around the hearth are some smiths' tools 
(hammers, tongs etc.) and some old mining 
tools (picks and shovels) which the goblins 
were in the process of re-forging. Next to 
the hearth are five sacks of coal. 

The stools are unexceptional, as is the table 
which bears the remains of a meal of 
mutton and carrots. Under the table are 
three sacks containing fruit (mostly 
apples), vegetables (carrots and potatoes) 
and nuts respectively. The mattresses are 
thin, straw-filled bags. 

The chest isold (it belonged to thedwarves) 
and very solidly made. The lock may be 
picked or unlocked with the key from the 
hobgoblin (see area 18). The chest contains 
10 clear glass bottles. Five of these are 
empty, three contain white wine and one 
holds brandy. The last bottle is corked and 
sealed with wax, and contains only a 
tightly rolled sheet of parchment - a scroll 
with the clerical spell neutralise poison. It 
may be extracted if the stopper is removed, 
but if the bottle is smashed there is a 50% 
chance that the scroll will be cut and 
ruined. If the chest is smashed open, there 
is a 30% chance for each bottle that it will 
break. 


20. Giant Bats 

The following description of the giant 
bats'rave assumes it is daytime and that the 
adventurers will be approaching it from 
the mine. If not. the DM should amend it 
accordingly: 

" ~ 

The faint glimmer of light in the 
tunnel ahead becomes steadily bright 
er as you advance until, turning a 
corner, you are confronted by the 
dazzling brilliance of daylight. The 
hewn walls of the tunnel have given 
way to a wide cavern with a natural 
entrance. At first it seems unoccup 
ied, but suddenly theair is filled with 
high-pitched whistles and the flap 
ping of leathery wings.... batsl 


The cavern is approximately oval in plan 
(running east-west) and is roughly 40 feel 
long, 30 feet wide and 20 feet high. The 
mine tunnel enters at the eastern end and 
the rave mouth is at the western end. As 
long as the adventurers remain in the cave, 
the bats will continue toattack irrespective 
of their losses. Beyond the cave, the bats 
will not attack if four or more of their 
numbci have been killed. On the floor of 


the cave are the bones of the bats' animal 
victims and a gold amulet shaped like a 
writhing serpent.

21. Strange Companions 

The inhabitants of this part of the mine are 
a den/elian and a grey ooze who have co 
operated to form a mare of passages by 
eroding rock and ore deposits respectively. 
These passages meet the mine tunnel at 
only one place: 

-- - - 

You begin to noiicea foul reek which 
becomes stronger as you approach a 
side-passage which joins the tunnel. 
This passage is clearly not part of the 
original mine workings. It is circular, 
smooth-walled, and follows a slightly 
meandering course to a point a short 
distance away, where it branches. 


The creatures' tunnels branch, twist and 
rejoin in an amaringly complex fashion, 
giving the impression of a mare. The DM 
should draw up a quick, rough map of the 
passage system (starting with a four-way 
junction 30 feet from the mine tunnel) 
marking the positions of the grey oore, the 
denrelian and three (separate) onyx gems 
(value - 50gp each) which are lying in the 
tunnel, ignored by the creatures. The 
passages are all circular in section and 10 
feet across, and should bend and/or split 
every 30 feet or so, in order to cover a total 
area between about 100 and 150 feet across. 
II required, the random dungeon generat 
ing tables I, III and IV (see DMG pi 70) may 
be modified and used to produce the maze. 

The dcnzclian is no threat to the adven 
turers, but tile grey ooze will attack to kill. 
In many ways the two creatures are similar 
in appearance, and the DM may wish to 
make their descriptions slightly ambigu 
ous deliberately, in order to test the skill of 
the players.

22. Gateway into the Valley 

This narrow pass was once the main route 
into the dwarves' domain, and was well 
guarded at this point (where it is 20 feet 
wide) by a thick stone wall (15 feet high) 
pierced by a gateway only 7 feet high and 5 
feet wide. 

The gateway could be blocked by a 
portcullis which was raised or lowered by a 
winch at ground level on the northern side. 
Along the top of the wall is a line of 
downward-pointing metal spikes, but these 
are now rusted and blunt. The rope and 
winch of the portcullis have rotted away 
and a kampfult has taken their place in 
order to ambush the unwary: 


A wall stands astride the pass ahead 
of you. as grey and weathered as the 
sheer rock faces on either side. At the 
foot of the wall is a narrow gateway, 
its portcullis raised as if in invita 
tion. 


The kampfult will allow the portcullis to 
drop when half (rounded up) of the 
adventurers have passed through. Char 
acters attempting to leap through the 
gateway beneath the falling (xirtcullis will 
only succeed if they make a successful 
dexterity check. Otherwise, they will be hit 
by the portcullis, suffer 1-8 hit |>oinis of 
damage and Ik- pinned down until it is 
raised or destroyed (see below). 

The kampfult will attack any creatures on 
its side of the gale and, lacking speed to 
(lee, will fight until killed.

#AT 6; D 1; SA Surprise on I-3: SD Nil; 
MR Std; lnt Low; AL N(E); Size S; xp 50; 
THACO 16; MMII. 

The portcullis consists of wooden beams 
bolted together. It may be lifted (usual 
Bend Bars/Lift Gate chance) or smashed. 
Smashing requires only 20 hit points of 
damage (automatic hit) since the timber is 
in poor condition. The wall may be 
climbed (treat as "fairly rough/non-xlip- 
pery" - DMG p!9) in which case the rusted 
spikes will not impede. 

Clearly visible near the winch is the hilt of 
a broken sword. In the handle is a cavity 
(the ivory pommel acts as the stopper) 
containing two doses of a potion ol speed (a 
sweet, yellow, slightly fizzy liquid). The 
pommel is finely carved (value - I25gp).

BARROW SWARD 


(Encounter Areas 23-26: Map 1) 


This relatively short stretch of the valley 
consists mostly of a lush green meadow 
across which the river meanders. The 
narrow valley running down to the mead 
ow from the west has less lush vegetation 
and more rocks. 


ENCOUNTER AREAS 


23. Spiders' Lair 


The valley narrows at this point (to about 
30 feet) and a pair of large spiders have 
woven a barrier of webs across it: 


Like the limbers of some ancient, 
wrecked ship, a cage of massive, 
bleached ribs stands as a mule 
monument to a long-dead giant 
amongst beasts. The skull and other 
scattered bones are shrouded by a 
sheet of pallid, web-like strands, 
while on either side intricate traceries 
of threads block the valley like a pair 
of outstretched wings. 


24. Al-Mi'raj Meadow 


14 al-mi'raj (6 male, 8 female): AC 6; MV 
18": HD I; hp 4 each: #AT I; D I -4; SA Nil; 
SD Nil; MR Std; Int Animal; AL N: Size S; 
xp 14 each; THACO 19; FF. 


The meadow on the eastern side of the river 
is grazed by a colony of al-mi'raj whose lait 
is inside the barrow (area 25). The males, in 
a wild act of bravado, will try to attack the 
party: 


The skeleton is that of a large mammoth, 
the skull lies on the eastern side but the 
tusks were removed long ago. Two large 
spiders live inside the ribcage. They will 
notice the vibrations caused by any at 
tempts made to cut through the web of the 
barrier and will rush out in search of their 
next meal. They will not notice if fire is 
used to make a hole in the hairier, however, 
since this causes less vibration. They will 
fight until killed, but will not pursue the 
party more than 50 yards Irom the web. 


25. Burial Mound 


Clearly visible from the flat meadow is a 
low, turf-covered mound (about 90 feet 
long, 50 feet wide and 10 feet high). It is 
aligned roughly east-west and contains an 
ancient burial chamber which theal-mt'raj 
(area 24) use as a lair. 


The turf is lush and springy beneath 
your feet, and eases for a while the 
exertion of your long journey. As 
you walk, a group of large yellow 
hares or rabbits comes into view from 
behind a long, low turfy mound. The 
creatures are still some distance 
away, but you can see them nibbling 
contentedly at the grass. 


a. Entrance Tunnel 

The tunnel entrance to the barrow chamber 
is at the western end. The stone door at the 
end of the tunnel is trapped: 


2 large spiders: AC 8; MV 6""24"; HD 1+1: 
hp 6 each; #AT 1; D 1; SA Poison (save at

Then one of them sees you. It raises 
itself up to its hind legs and you see 
that it has a single horn - like that ol 
a unicorn. Another sits up and looks 
at you... then another... and another... 


A strange animal smell lingers in 
this low, dark tunnel which leads 
gently down into one end of the 
mound. Shielding your eyes from the 
light outside, you can make out the 
grey stone slabs of the floor covered 
with small muddy footprints. Above, 
the low ceiling is a single massive 
slab, its weight supported by smallei 
slabs set on edge to form the walls. 
Twenty feet or so away the tunnel 
ends at a blank wall. 


The mammoth was killed by a lone Kharg 
tribesman but collapsed upon its assailant 
and killed him. The Kharg's bones lie, 
entangled by webs, between theribcageand 
the skull. Most of his gear (leather armour, 
pack, shield, spear and sword) are rotted 
and useless, but there is a gold buckle on 
his belt (value - 40gp) and his pack contains 
a figurine of a horse carved in jet (value - 
200gp). The paint on the Kharg's shield is 
cracked and faded but the shape of a 
stylised coiled snake can be dearly seen. 


The six male al-mi'raj will first be seen at a 
range of d4 +6x10 yards. They will not cross 
the river (and will retreat if attacked by 
characters on the western bank) but will 
attack fearlessly any adventurer in the 
meadow east of it. The remaining eight 
al-mi'raj are females who will not fight and 
will flee if threatened. 


BARROW SWARD (Emounirr arras 23-2 5) 19 








The tunnel is 5 feet wide. 4 feet high and 20 
feel long, and the slabs arc only crudely 
hewn. The footprints are those of the al- 
mi'raj. which have dug a tunnel (1 fool 
square and 15 feel long) between the 
entrance tunnel and the chamber (area 
25b), emerging at a narrow gap between the 
wall slabs at either end. This tunnel is not 
concealed in any way. 

The stone slab at the end of the tunnel is 
actually a door. This is not obvious, but 
will become apparent if the tunnel is 
searched. The slab is very heavy but pivots 
at the left-hand edge. As soon as it is moved, 
however, the trap will be sprung. The door 
has a glyph of warding cast upon it. When 
the door is opened, this will explode with a 
burst of flame, inflicting 5 hit points of 
damage on any character within 5 feet. 
Damage is halved if a successful saving 
throw vs. Spells is made. 

b. Chamber 

The chamber contained several cremation 
urns, but most of these have been broken: 

Any expectations ol a lavish tomb 
laden with riches are soon dashed. 
Peering through the enfolding 
gloom, you see a low chamber 
which, to judge from the smell and 
the litter on the floor, has been an 
animal lair for many years. Except 
for an empty, stone sarcophagus in 
the centre ol the chamber, and two 
crude jars against one wall, you see 
little else here but useless, smashed 
pottery. 


The chamber is about 20 feet across and 
roughly circular. The ceiling consists of a 
single, rough-hewn slab of stone and the 
walls and Hour are ol similar (but smaller) 
slabs. The al-ini'raj tunnel (see above) 
emerges between two ol the wall slabs. 

Originally, there were several sealed cer 
amic jars here (each about 12 inches high) 
containing cremated bones and. occasion 
ally, items of value. All but two of these 

20 BARROW SWARD (Encounlrr area 26) 


have been smashed and if the characters 
search the floor, they will find fragments of 
bone and several items of crude jewellery 
mixed with the litter. There are three small 
gold earrings (value - 5gp each), an 
clectrum bangle (value - 15gp) and a 
pendant consisting of a piece of jade with a 
silver mount (value - lOOgp). 

The two intact jars are decorated with an 
embossed snake motif. Both contain frag 
ments of cremated bones. One also contains 
a small, carved, ivory box inlaid with silver- 
arid coral (value - 300gp), 

The sarcophagus is very old and worn. The 
lid lies next to it on the Tloor and closer 
examination will reveal the crude carving 
ol a human/humanoid figure on its 
surface. The base of the sarcophagus is a 
concealed, stone, trap door covering the 
shaft down to a poltergeist's lair (see 
below). Once discovered, this trap door tan 
be lifted out easily by two or more 
characters. 

c. Poltergeist's Cave 

A vertical shaft under the trap door in the 
sarcophagus leads toa rough cave contain 
ing a poltergeist. Immediately the trap 
door is opened, the poltergeist will come 
up into the burial chamber (25b) and start 
to throw fragments of pottery at the party: 

- 

A rough, slimy shaft leads down into 
the earth. It is difficult to be certain, 
but it looks as though there might be 
some sort of cavern at tire bottom... 
Suddenly, out ol the comer of your 
eye. you catch sight of one of the 
numerous shards ol pottery rising 
from the ground. It hovers in mid-air 
for a second and then flies towards 
you as if thrown by an unseen hand... 

¦ 

The poltergeist w-ill continue to throw 
small objectsat the adventurers until either 
they all flee in terror, or it is turned or 
destroyed.

The poltergeist may be turned as a skeleton 
in the burial chamber, but is as resistant as 
a ghoul in the cave at the bottom of the 
shaft. If it is able, ii will follow any 
characters who climb down the shaft and 
bombard them with loose rocks and so on. 


The shaft is about 6 feet in diameter and 30 
feel deep. It should be treated as "very 
rough - slightly slippery" for the purposes 
of climbing (see DMG pl9). At the bottom 
it opens out into a rough cavern: 


The shaft suddenly opens out into a 
rough, damp cave, where a grinning 
skull lies on the floor amid some 
other mildewed brines. 


The bones arc all that remain of the 
poltergeist's previous, human existence. In 
a small pouch under the skull are three 
bloodstone gems (value - 50gp each). 


26. Spiral Stairway 

This stairway was built by the dwarves 
before the mires formed below the Barrow- 
Sward. It is plain, skilfully constructed, 
about 10 feet wide and 10 feel high. At top 
and bottom, the entrances are plain, arched 
doorways each of which was guarded by a 
pair ol caryatid columns. These were all 
killed some time ago and their statue-like 
remains may be seen near the respective 
entrances. At the bottom of the stairway, a 
short passage runs south to the doorway 
opening out on to the bog. On the western 
side of the passage, a 10-foot-wide doorway 
leads into a square room 20 feet across. As 
the adventurers approach, they will hear 
the rats which live here: 
- 

To one side of the passage is a 
doorway; just far enough from the 
exit for the daylight to do no more

28. Killer Frog 

Beside ihe swamp path, an aggressive killer 
frog lives in a shallow pool: 

---- 

The path loops around a still pool of 
sickly water, overlain by ragged 
wisps of mist. As you watch, a few 
bubbles of air rise and burst, sending 
ripples lazily out across the water. 
Just as these have faded away, two 
bulbous eyes rise silently from the 
depths and turn towards you. 


The killer frog lives on a diet of small 
swamp creatures plus occasional bully- 
wugs (see areas 29, 30 and 31) and humans 
who wander into the bog. It will leap from 
the water to attack the party on sight and 
will continue to fight until killed.

amulet shaped like a snake (value - Igp). 

Buily wug War (areas 29,30 and 31) 

The south-western part of the swamp is 
inhabited by two bands of warring bully- 
wugs. One band (the more intelligent and 
better equipped) lives in a crude stone 
tower (area 31) on a small island. The 
remainder are less intelligent, poorly 
equipped, and arc stationed in small 
groups around the tower. The party will 
only encounter two of these groups - 
stationed on the dry paths (areas 29 and 30). 


29. Road Block 

Ahead of them on the path, the adventurers 
will see a group of four bullywugs: 


From somewhere ahead, muted snat 
ches of conversation drift to you 
through the mist and peering for 
ward you can see a rough barrier 
blocking the path. Squatting on this, 
their shapes softened by the mist, are 
a handful of creatures - half-men 
and half-frog - babbling and gest 
iculating with long, webbed hands. 


The bullywugs are 40 yards away from the 
party. They will attack the adventurers on 
sight, but if three are killed, the survivor 
will flee into the swamp.

The bullywugs each have lOgp worth of 
crude jewellery, made from bones, teeth, 
obsidian pebbles, silver wire and leather 
thonging. 

Their barrier may be climbed over easily or 
thrown to one side. 


30. Lizard Keepers 

Two bullywugs here are keeping a giant 
lizard in a cage. When they release it, 
however, it will attack them rather than the 
party: 

- - ¦¦ ¦ 

The path leads you onto an island of 
sorts, where the ground is agreeably 
firmer underfoot. The mist thins a 
little and, in a small clearing, you are 
confronted by a cage of stout 
branches crudely lashed together 
with creepers. 

Inside is a huge lizard, its tongue 
lashing between massive jaws and its 
eyes watching you hungrily. 


The two bullywugs are hidden in the 
undergrowth near the cage. When the party 
comes into view, they will leap from 
concealment and open the cage door, 
expecting the lizard to attack the adven 
turers. Instead, the lizard will attack (and 
almost certainly kill) the bullywugs. (If the 
DM does not wish to roll the dice for this 
combat, an 'average' result would be for the 
bullywugs to be killed in the 3rd and 5th 
rounds of combat respectively and for the 
lizard to suffer a total of 5 hit points of 
damage.) 

The bullywugs each have lOgp worth of 
crude jewellery which they have made 
themselves (see area 29). 

After the lizard has killed the bullywugs. it 
will pick up one of the bodies in its jaws 
and disappear into the swamp without 
harming the adventurers. However, if the 
adventurers attack the lizard (except with 
ranged weapons or spells) it will turn on 


them and fight until killed (any surviving 
bullywugs will lake this opportunity to 
flee).

31. Bullywug Tower 

The small group of advanced, intelligent 
bullywugs lives in a crude tower on an 
island in the swamp: 

- 

The ground to either side has become 
noticeably drier and the path, now 
showing a definitely upward slope, 
is no longer muddy. By degrees, the 
dense vegetation gives way to a rocky 
hillside topped by a stubby tower of 
unmortared stones. There is a sudden 
movement on the battlements, and 
an arrow whistles towards you, only 
to flash harmlessly by into the 
bushes. 

- 

The occupants of the tower are four 
bullywugs equipped with short bows, long 
swords, chainmail armour and shields. 
The first arrow was a warning shot and the 
bullywugs will follow it up with a shouted 
message in the common tongue, ordering 
the party to go away. The bullywugs will 
not negotiate. If the tower is attacked, they 
will defend it to the last, but will not leave 
it to attack the party. The bullywugs each 
have 9gp worth of mixed coins and/or 
cheap jewellery.

The clearing in which the tower stands is 
about 200 feet across. The tower itself is 
built of rough stones and is about 20 feet in 
diameter. A heavy wooden door opens into 
a ground floor room from where a ladder 
leads up through a trapdoor to a battle- 
mented roof, 10 feel above the ground. The 
battlements provide 50% cover for the 
bullywugs (see DMG p64). 


22 SLOUGH MIRES (Encounter areas 28-31) 



















The lintel above the door is a re-used piece 
of dwarven masonry and bears a carving of 
a snake (now upside-down). 

The lower room has no windows, and the 
door may be barred from the inside. The 
bullywugs have a table, six stools, a barrel 
ol swamp watet and a sack of dried fish. 
Hanging from the ceiling is a smoky quartz 
gem on a silver mount. The gem was 
originally a pendant and has a continual 
light spell cast upon it. Its value is I lOgp. 

The table has a drawer which is locked and 
trapped. The trap releases a spray of tiny, 
razor-sharp darts which will inflict a total 
of 1-6 hit points of damage on all within a 
10-foot-radius semi-circle in front of the 
the drawer. A successful dexterity check 
will halve the damage. The drawer contains 
1 lOgp in a cloth bag. 


32. Mist Mephit 

In the part of the swamp where the mist is 
densest, a mist mephit lives in an old 
hollow tree: 

- 

Mist washes around your feet like 
water, swirls in tattered wisps 
through bushes and reed beds, and 
hangs like shrouds from the branches 
of a wizened tree. It is thicker here 
than it has been elsewhere in the 
swamp, and seems to be growing 
thicker by the second. The tree you 
could see clearly a moment ago 
becomes only a vague shadow then 
vanishes completely, and seconds 
later you can see no further than an 
arm's length away) 


The sudden thickening of the mist is a 
result of the wall of fog spell cast by the 
mist mephit from inside the tree when the 
party comes within range (30 yards). The 
wall of fog wil I be centred on the party and 
will spread along the path in a bank 80 feet 
long, 30 feet wide and 10 feet deep. 

Next round, the mephit will fly out of the 
tree to attack the party. It will concentrate 
on the use of its breath weapon and attempt 
to avoid hand-to-hand fighting. It is a 
cowardly creature and will not attack the 
adventurers if they move outside the wall of 
fog or if the fog disperses. It will flee 
(assuming gaseous form i( necessary) once 
its breath attacks arc exhausted, or if any 
fire-based attacks are used against it, or if it 
is reduced to 9 or fewer hit points. It is 


wearing a platinum chain around its neck 
(value - 50gp).

The mephit was sent here to waylay 
travellers and to ensure that the swamp 
remained a generally unwholesome place. 
For the purposes of this module it will 
always be unsuccessful in its attempts to 
gate in other mephits. 

The hollow centre of the tree (auto 
matically found if the area is searched) 
contains objects taken from the mephit's 
victims: 50gp in mixed coins, a gold arm- 
band (value - 80gp) and an iron helm with a 
gold crest in the form of a snake (value - 
50gp). 


33. Enemies on the Ledge 

A cave opens onto the ledge which runs 
along the rock face. A gnoll lives here with 
six kobolds whom he treats as slaves. When 
the party approaches, the gnoll will order 
the kobolds to attack: 


In the valley, hundreds of feet below 
the ledge you are following, the 
steamy swamp is gradually giving 
way to woodland. The ledge, how 
ever, carries on and on, unchanging, 
with no sign yet of a way down. 

Roundinga small spur of the mount 
ain, you come upon a low, dark cave 
mouth. A harsh voice echoes from 
the depths and half-a-dozen unarmed 
kobolds rush, half staggering, into 
the daylight. Dazzled, they hesitate, 
but a second shout from within 
drives them on once more. 


The cave will be about 60 feet away when 
the party first sees it. The kobolds are more 
fearful of the gnoll than of the adventurers 
and will fight them to the death. In full 
daylight, the kobolds will attack at -1 to hit.

The cave mouth is 6 feet across and 5 feet 
high. Beyond, the cave is widcT (15 feet), 
higher (7 feet) and about 30 feet deep. 


The gnoll will lurk at the back of the cave 
hoping to remain unseen. If the adventurers 
pass by the cave he will not attack but if 
they enter, he will fire arrows at them (if 
possible) before taking up his battle axe 
and fighting to the death.

In addition to his bow. 20 arrows and axe, 
the gnoll has a plain, clectrum headband 
(value - 5gp), a thick gold earring with a 
malachite stone (value - 25gp) and 12gp in 
a pouch hung around his neck. 

The cave contains the straw bedding of the 
gnoll and kobolds. along with a sack of 
dried meat and a cask of stale beer. 

The gnoll has hidden a silver hat pin with a 
small tourmaline head (value - 45gp) in a 
crack in the wall of the cave near the 
mouth. The chance of finding it is the same 
as for a concealed door. 


34. Wild Cats 

Following the river through the valley, tire 
adventurers will find that the mist gradual 
ly disperses as the swamp gives way to a 
dark, briar-choked woodland. In order to 
make progress, the parly will have to hack 
thtough briars every 20 yards or so. When 
they arc about hallway through the wood, 
the adventurers will come across a pair of 
wild cats: 

> 1 > 

Disentangling yourselves from yet 
another patch of clinging briars, you 
come face to face with a pair of 
wildcats standing over a freshly 
killed young deer. Spitting and 
hissing, with their backs arched, the 
cats prepare to defend their prize. 


In the circumstances the cats will not 
surprise the adventurers. They will attack 
if threatened in any way or if the adven 
turers make any move except to back away 
slowly. They will fight until one of them is 
killed at which point the survivor will flee. 
They have no treasure.

(Encounter Areas 35-48: Maps I and 2) 


The tribe comes 10 the island only once a

Am Flowmane - cleric and revered tribal 
elder. 


Am will attack die party and light to the 
death in sell-defence, or il the adventurers 
attempt to come onto the island, but not 
otherwise. 


24 EYE OF THE SERPENT (Encountrr area }f) 


REACHING 
THE ISLAND 


The adventurers should have no difficulty 
in finding or reaching the island. The 
grassy plain between the foot of Hardway 
Mountain and the ledge above Trenhurst 
Forest (see Map I) is almost completely flat, 
and the Kharg tribe (with the exception of 
Am Flowmane - see below) is far away to 
the north with its herds of horses (see 
below). 

The Serpent River is slow-moving and 
shallow as it crosses the plain and may be 
forded easily. The lake above the falls (the 
snake's "head') is deep (about 50 feet), but 
between the island (the Eye of the Serpent) 
and the lake's northern bank, the water is 
shallow and may be waded easily. To the 
west of the spiked fence (area 36), the island 
rises gently from the lake, but to the east the 
shore is steep and rocky and may only be 
scaled by characters with the ability to 
climb walls. 

THE ISLAND 

The island, with its pool of flame and cleft 
of rock crystals is the "Eye of the Serpent", 
the site of the Grafenvolk dwarves' snake 
cult shrine (see BACKGROUND - page 3). 
The Kharg refer to it as Rushmede Rock 
and use it as a meeting place and a place of 
execution. A large constrictor snake is kept 
at the eastern end of the island (see area 37) 
and those convicted of serious crimes often 
choose to be killed quickly by the snake 
rather than face Hardway Mountain.

35. Council Ring 

Tlte council of the Kharg elders meets on 
Rushmede Rock once a year in a clearing 
on the western part of the island: 


Am has a violent hatred of foreigners 
(those who are not of the Kharg tribe) and 
his rantings will consist of a mixture of 
insults and curses. The DM should invent 
these as appropriate, making them as 
provocative as possible. In an attempt to 
frighten the parly, Arn will command one 
of the characters to "drown". Since the 
spell only lasts I round, it should not 
severely endanger the victim. 


ARN FLOWMANE 


Am Flowmane guards the island. Unless 
the adventurers are able to conceal their 
apptoach across the flat plain. Am will see 
them and will Ik* waiting for them when 
they come ashore. (If Am is not aware of the 
party's approach, he will be found seated at 
the council ring - area 35). He will go 
onto the eastern end of the island if he 
thinks the party will come that way stnee 
he has no fear of the snake (area 37): 


Approaching the island, you scan 
the shore for signs of life, but are 
greeted only by the lifeless stares of 
human skulls hanging from the 
trees. Then, without warning, an old 
man in a robe of snake skins leaps 
from the undergrowth by the water's 
edge and begins to hurl curses and 
abuse at you, all the while swinging 
a wooden staff wildly in the ait. 


You have come to a small clearing 
where 20 or so small standing stones 
have been arranged in a tight circle. 







seat lot a council member. Am Flowmane 
lives here. His store of simple foods (fruit, 
tuns and dried tneai) is kept under a rough 
shelter of branches at the edge of the 
clearing. Nearby is Arn's bed of ferns. 


36. Spiked Fence 

This fence serves to keep the snake (see area 
37) at the eastern end of the island. The 
description assumes that the adventurers 
will approar It the fence along the path, but 
the construction of the barrier is the same 
throughout ns length: 

-- 

A wall-like mass of tangled hi iars as 
high asa man blocks your path. This 
is no natural growth, lot the thorny 
branches have been woven around 
tbit k wooden stakes driven into the 
ground. Where the path meets the 
fence, there is a stout wooden gate 
lashed all around with briars. 
__ 

The fence can be cut through easily with 
edged weapons, and the gate is not locked. 
The thorns ate very sharp, however, and 
< hatactets who persist in < limiting over the

sloping top is a long, thick snake,

from its resting place and slithers 
towards you. 


Tlte snake is used by the kltatg both as a 
guardian lor then sacred site and as a 
means ol execution. The snake is ac 
customed to facing unarmed victims and 
will attac k the party fearlessly until killed.

The |jool o( flame (area 38) is plainly 
visible from the clearing. In the clearing 
itself, the only items of interest ate the 
remains of the dwarves' obelisk and the 
wooden board leaning against it. 

The obelisk is about 6 feet square at the 
base and stands to a maximum height of 4 
feet. It beats the final portion ol a panel of 
dwarven writing and. below this, a repre 
sentation ol the writhing serpent symbol. 
Any character able to read the dwarven 
script or. for example, using a comprehend 
languages sytcTI will lx- able to understand 
the inscription as follows: 

...pooI 
...in flame 
...door of crystal 
...Eye of the Serpent. 
Beloved it is. and who has not trekked the 
heights to see the snake's true bright 
beacon. 

Leaning against the obelisk is a stout 
wcxxlett panel on which the kltatg have 
recorded tbeit translation of the inscript 
ion. The translation is in the common 
tongue and has been carefully carved, but it 
is not vety accurate. It reads: 

...water ...of fire ...glass barrier ...the 
Serpent's Eye. It is beyond price but none 
lias climbed the mountain to find the 
snake's pure dazzling jewel. 

Either version ol the inscription should 
serve as a due to the location of the shrine 
(areas 39 and -10) behind the flaming pool 
and c rystal door (area 38). The upper pan 
ol the obelisk was removed long ago and 
the adventurers will not be able to find it. 


38. Pool of Flame and Crystal Door 

A narrow cleft in the rock bluff of the island 
contains a flaming |xxil and. beyond this, a 
concealed door: 

-\ 

Rising above the eastern end of the 
clearing is a high rock bluff fashion 
ed by the years into weird shapes. But 
these hold little interest compared 
with a narrow cleft in the bluff, 
barely 20 feet deep. Here, there is a 
bubbling pool, its surface covered by 
long dancing flames. Above the 
flames, behind and on either side, 
nature has revealed a glittering bed 
of crystals which reflect the file's 
yellow light like a beacon. 

I_ 4 


Although the weathering of the bluff is 
entirely natural, the cleft and pool were 
dug out by the Grafenvolk dwarves. The 
flames are led by natural gas which bubbles 
up from the bottom of the pool and does 
not. of course, burn beneath the surface. 
Even a cursory inspection of the pool will 
reveal that although the flames span the 
cleft (torn side to side, they cover only the 
central 10 leet ol it leaving 5 feet of open 
watei before and behind. Since the pool is 3 
feet deep, it is a relatively simple matter to 
crawl under the flames to the clear area 
beyond. Unless magically protected, char 
acters touching the flames will suffer 1 hit 
point ol damage and those passing through 
them will suffer 1-6 hit points of damage 
plus an additional 1-6 hit points for each 
round they remain in them. 

Just above the surface of the pool at the t eat 
of the cleft is a concealed door consisting of 
a sitt er of crystals lused together. From the 
clearing, dwarven characters will auto 
matically notice the door if they look into 
the cleft. Other c haracters have only a 10% 
< hance ol noticing it from the clearing but 
will automatically find it if they cross or 
by-pass the flatties. Once found, the door 
may be pulled open easily to reveal the 
passage (area 39) beyond. 

The rock crystal of the doot and of the cleft 
is of poor quality and has no value. 

BENEATH THE ISLAND 

The downfall ol the priesthood of the 
Grafenvolk dwarves began when they fell 
under the influence of a small clan of 
duergat. During the general decline of the 
Grafenvolk, the light-hating duergar estab 
lished themselves in a lair beneath the 
island where Lhey built their own. dark 
parody (area -IS)of thedwarves' brightly lit 
shrine (area 40). 

During the final days of the Grafenvolk, 
the duergar stole the golden snake and the 
speat (see areas 43. 46 and 47) from the 
shrine, killed the dwarf pi tests and placed 
the animated skeletons of snakes in the 
dwarves' shrine. 

Deprived of a people to exploit, the duergar 
themselves went into a long, slow decline, 
living frugally by hunting at night in the 
Trenhutst Forest. Recently, tbeit fortunes 
have been made worse by a feud with a tribe 
of buckawn. The duergar have captured 
Linden, one of the buckawns (see area 43). 
II they free him. Linden will aid the 
adventurers against the duetgat.

Unless otherwise stated, all rooms and 
passages below the island are 10 feet high, 
with plain stone walls and heavy, iron- 
bound. oak doors. The older dwarven 
tunnel lings (arras 39 and *10) pass through 
a vein of luminous, translucent rock. The 
other underground areas are cut into dull, 
grey bedrock. Except for the stirge rave 
(area 41) which receives daylight, these 
other areas are not illuminated. The 
players' descriptions assume that it is 
daytime and/or that the party has some 
source of light. 


Encounter Areas 

39. Passage 

This circular passage spirals down to the 
dwarves' shrine (area 40) and the duergar 
chambers beyond (areas 41-48): 


The walls of the passage, delicately 
carved to resemble the scales of a 
snake, are translucent and glow with 
a pale light from deep in the rock 
itself. The passage is circ ular, and as 
it coils deeper and deeper under 
ground you feel as if you have been 
swallowed by a great beast. 


The rock through which the tunnel winds 
is a solid mass of rock crystal (not gem- 
quality) deep within which the dwarves 
had continual light spells cast. 


40. Dwarves' Shrine 

Like the duergar shrine (area 43). this 
chamber has been carved out to resemble a 
snake's head. It is guarded by the animated 
skeletons of seven snakes: 


Eventually the passage levels out and 
runs on a short distace before opening 
out into a chamber hewn from the 
same luminous rock. For a moment 
its shape is baffling but then you 
realise the makers' intent: with the 
winding passage as a body, the 
chamber has been masterfully fash 
ioned into the form of a serpent's 
head. 

Writhing on the floor, fleshless but 
yet not dead, are the blanched skel 
etons of seven snakes, one of them 
much larger than the rest. 


If attacked, or if the parly enters the 
chamber, the skeleton snakes will attack. 
They will fight until destroyed but will not 
pursue the party beyond the shrine. The 
shrine increases the snakes' resistance to 
turning and they are treated as zombies (I- 
12 are affected if (he turning is successful). 

There are six small snakes and one large 
(because of their sire, the smaller snakes 
inflict less than standard damage).

41. Stirge Cave 

The tunnel from the dwarves' shrine (area 
40) passes out of the mass of glowing, rock 
crystal under the island and into the 
surrounding, dark grey bedrock It leads to 
a natural cave, which is the lair of a pair of 
stirges: 

f 

Soon after leaving the room of the 
skeleton snakes, the tunnel leaves the 
glowing, translucent rock behind 
and the walls become stark and grey. 
Turning a bend, you see daylight 
ahead and the passage opens into a 
cavern where the air is filled with the 
sound of falling water. Both the light 
and sound are coming from the 
mouth of the cave at the far end, 
which looks out onto the back of a 
waterfall. 

Two small, flying creatures drop 
from amongst the stalactites on the 
roof and flap towards you, silhouet 
ted against the light. At first, the 
shape o! their wings reminds you of 
bats but. as they draw nearer you see 
their dagget-like snouts and realise 
to yout dismay that they are some 
thing else entirely.... 

- 

The stalactite-covered ceiling of the cave is 
20 feet high in the centre. It is rather damp, 
as is the floor which slopes gently down 
towards the cave mouth. 


The stirges usually hunt in the Trenhurst 
Forest beyond the waterfall, but they are 
not avetse to attacking prey which finds its 
own way into theit iait. If one of the 
creatures is killed, the other will flee unless 
it is attached to a victim. The stirges have 
no treasure.

The waterfall drops over an overhanging 
ledge at the top of the cliff and there is a gap 
between the water and the cave mouth. The 
forest below can be discerned through the 
cascading water. The cave mouth is about 
200 feet above the forest floorand characters 
who stand at the edge will be able to seethe 
full 300-foot drop of the waterfall. 

A piercer lives amongst the stalactites on 
the roof of the northern arm of the cavern 
above the hole in the lloor leading down to 
the snake pit (area 42). It will attack the first 
creature to approach the hole.

The hole in the floor of the cave is about 5 
feet across and leads down to the floor of 
the snake pit 15 feet below. Characters 
looking down the hole will catch a glimpse 
of one of the snakes; 

r ¦ 

Below you is the floor of another 
cave, littered with bones of all shapes 
and sizes. As you watch, one of 
several sheep skulls moves a little 
and a small, iridescent snake slithers 
lazily out through one of the eye- 
sockets. Apparently unaware of your 
presence, it winds its way between 
the other bones and passes from 
view. 


Further details of the snakes and the pit are 
given in the following encounter descript 
ion. 

42. Snake Pit 

Many snake's liveamongst the bones on the 
floot of this cave and the sight of them is 
daunting. II the adventurers are careful, 
however, they should be able to cross safely: 


26 EYE OE THE SERPENT (Encounter areas 19-12) 













The cavern before you is low anti 
dark. Slithcting over, under and 
between the dull, dry bones linering 
ihe floor, you can make oui the scaly 
forms of at least a dozen snakes. 
Maybe even more, for who knows 
how many lurk hidden from view? 
But for now, at least, you seem to be 
safe, lor the creatines are taking no 
interest in you at all. 

- 

Tire rave is dry, and only 10 feet high. 

There are 20 small, poisonous snakes 
writhing around in thiscave. Of these, only 
halt will be visible at any one time while 
the rest are hidden inside or underneath the 
bones. They are well fed by theduergat and 
will only attack in self-defence or if 
disturbed. 

Normally, there is a 15% < haute that each of 
the characters passing across the cave will 
disturb one of the hidden snakes and Ire 
attacked, but so long as the adventurers 
make a point ol avoiding any visible snakes 
and tlo not disturb any of the larger bones 
(there is plenty of room between them) they 
will lx- safe. 

The snakes will only light individually. 
The others will not join in unless attacked 
or disturbed themselves.

The bones on the floor of the cave are 
mostly from sheep, horses, deer, rabbits 
and other animals. Mixed with them are 
the remains ol a few humans, an ell and a 
dwarf. There is no treasure here. 

The blockage at the eastern end of the rave 
is clearly artificial and was constructed by 
the duergar to shut out the daylight. The 
dtiot in the northern wall of the rave is 5 
feet above the ground and is reached by 
footholds cut into the stone. 


43. Dark Shrine 

A necrophidius has been set by the duergar 
to guard their latest captive, a burkawn. 
The necrophidius is facing away from the 
corridor and will be seen as the adventurers 
approach: 


lip ahead, the corridor opens out 
into a dark chamber. Framed in the 
doorway and facing away from you is 
the swaying skeleton of a huge snake 
with a human skull for a head. 
Beyond the skeleton, eyes glazed anti 
apparently rooted to the spot, is a 
tiny man dressed in green. 

. 

The necrophidius will not be able to 
surprise the adventurers, but they will have 
a better than usual chance of surprising it 
(i.e. normal parties will surprise on l-3oua 
d6, rangers on 1-4). The necrophidius will 
fight until destroyed.

The buckawn has been paralysed by the 
necrophidius. The effects of the paralysis 
will wear off 5 rounds after the party 
arrives. The buc kawn is called Linden. He 
cannot speak the common tongue but will 
want to help the adventurers and to warn 
them about the evil dwarves. Unless the 
adventurers speak brownie, pixie, satyr or 
sprite, any communication with Linden 
must be done using sign language. 

Linden will use his spell-like powers 
(once/rotind: audible glamer. change self, 
dancing lights, invisibility; ouce/day; 
entangle, pass without trace, summon 
insects, trip) to aid them in any fight 
against his old foes. He has no equipment, 
ami will seek to boirow a dagger or some 
darts from the adventurers. The DM should 
control the actions of Linden, bearing in 
mind his intelligence, hatred of theduergar 
and neutral alignment. When the duergai 
have been dealt with. Linden will take the 
first available opportunity to slip away 
invisibly back to his tribe in ihe forest.

The room is a daik parody ol the dwarves' 
shrine (area 40). Its shape also resembles a 
snake's head but the rock from which it was 
hewn is statk and gicy. Standing on a 
plain, black stone pedestal in the centre is a 
2-foot-high gold statue of a snake. 

The statue is hollow and worth only 50gp. 
As soon as it is moved a liquid will be fell 


sloshing around inside. The liquid may be 
poured out through the snake's mouth. It is 
a miscible combination (see DMG pi 19) of 
potions of fire resistance and animal 
control (reptiles/amphibians). The result 
ing liquid is green, smelling and tasting 
like brandy. There are three doses of the 
mixture, each of which will confer the full 
effects of both of the original potions. The 
two potions cannot be separated. If a half 
dose of the mixture is consumed, only the 
reduced effect, short-term fire resistance 
will apply (see DMG p!26). 

If the statue is examined, the party will 
notice that a large gem has been removed 
from its eye socket (the gem is in room 47). 


44. School for Duergar 

From outside the door to this room, the 
sound of harsh, chanting, female voices 
may be heard. In the room are five young 
duergar and two adult females: 


The chanting ends abruptly as you 
open the door. Sealed around a 
simple table in thecentrcol the room 
are two stocky women and some 
children. For a moment, you take 
them for dwarves, but surely no 
dwarf has such pallid skin and evil, 
penetrating eyes... 


The females were attempting to teach the 
children a traditional duergar saga in the 
form of a chant. When the duergai see the 
party, the young ones will hide behind the 
females who will attack at once. The two 
females will fight to the death unless the 
children are all killed, in which case the 
survivor will flee when the other is 
overcome. The young will not fight.

has a pair ol small, violet garnet earrings

have no treasure. 

The room contains a table, !2stoolsanc! 12 
simple wooden beds. It is somewhat 
crowded, since the table and stools were 
brought here in order to empty room 46. 


45. Store and Workshop 

This room is currently unoccupied: 

-", 

A place lor everything and everything 
in its place - this combined kitchen, 
storeroom and workshop clearly be 
longs to somebody with a line sense 
of otdet. From the clean bench and 
neat racks of tools and utensils above 
it at one end ol the room, to the 
carefully slacked casks and tidy 
shelves ol boxes, sticks, jars and 
bottles at the othet, nothing seems 
misplaced. Even the hearth in the 
centre ol the room has been swept. 


The room serves as kitchen, (orge and 
storeroom for Lite duergar. 

The kitchen equipment consists of an 
unexceptional variety ol pots, pans, plates, 
bowls and other utensils, while the work 
shop tools include hammers, chisels, saws, 
planes, woodworkers' axes, picks and 
shovels. There is even a small anvil. If they 
examine the room, the adventurers will 
notice that most of these objects are old, 
worn and heavily repaired. 

The stores consist ol food (mostly dried 
meat, dried (niits, smoked fish and nuts), 
drink (mostly water with some thin mead), 
fuel (charcoal and wood) and other miscel 
laneous items (including nails, timber and 
rope, with large quantities of scrap metal). 

The only items out of place in the room are 
three crossbow bolts lying on the bench. 
These arc unusual, since they are thin and 
have no fins. They are ammunition for the 
c rossbow trap (see area 47) and may serve as 
a clue to it. 


46. Duergar Warriors 

Characters listening at the door ol this 
room will hear what seems to be the sound 
of fighting: 


The door opens on the flash of 
weapons and the crash of blocking 
shields. Two ashen-faced dwarves 
are locked in mortal combat. You 
have but a moment to take in the 
scene before you are noticed. One of 
the pair turns towards you. drops his 
guard, and the other's spear finds its 
mark. Undeterred, the victim rushes 
towards you. followed by his erst 
while foe. 

¦ 

The duergar combat was being [ought 
undet strict rules (the winner would be the 
first to draw blcxxl) to decide who would 
have the pleasure ol killing the buckawn 
(area 48). Their dispute will lx 1 forgotten 
when the adventurers arrive, and the 
duergar will fight to the death.

The wounded duergar has a gold headband 
and a pair of matching arm bands (total 
value - llOgp). The other duergar lias 
similar jewellery, set with citrines (total 
value - 180gp). He also has the key to the 
treasury (area 47) hidden in his right boot. 

The magical speat is dearly a special 
weapon. It is a spear +1. +2 vs. giant class 
creatures anti +3 vs. ores and ogres. 


47. Treasury 

The door to this room is locked and 
trapped. I he key may be found in the right 
boot of one of the male duergat (area 46) 
but even tl the lock is opened with it or 
successfully picked, the trap must be 
disarmed separately by means of a bidden 
catch (normal find/remove traps chance). 
If not disarmed the trap will fire a cross 
bow bolt from a hole in the ceiling just in 
Ironi of the door when it is opened. Unless 
special precautions are taken, the bolt will 


automatically hit the character opening 
the door, doing 1-4 hit points of damage. A 
monk will have the usual chance of 
dodging missiles: 


In blank astonishment your eyes 
light upon an amazing sight. Neatly 
stacked in row upon row on the 
surface ol an ancient table ate piles of 
coins. At the real of the table is a 
small, bulging, leather pouch. Even 
without these exciting contents the 
room itself would have appeared 
dull - but now you hardly notice its 
tough walls and bate floor. 


In all there ate 40 piles of elec mini pieces 
with lOcoins in each pile. The small pout h 
contains a large star sapphire (the- gem 
from the golden statue in room 43) worth 

2000gp. 

In all the excitement it is possible that the 
patty may miss a hole in thereat wall of the 
room in which is stored a fat leather-bound 
volume. This book is the tribal history ol 
this gtoupof duergat wiitteti irt then own 
strange script. When the party linds the 
means to translate this text (and the DM 
should remembet how expensive a sage's 
time is!) they will discovet the lull story of 
the Grafenvolk and theit downfall. 


48. Exit to the Forest 

Flu spital staircase leads down to a metal 
gate and then to a dexn which opens into 
the lorest: 

* .. 

Trudging ever downwards you begin 
to understand (lie expression 'the 
bowels ol the earth'. The spiral 
staircase is seemingly endless and its 
damp walls and low ceiling increase 
your sense of disquiet. Suddenly, 
after a descent of over 200 feet, the 
stair flattens out into a low damp 
corridor. Not far into the corridor 
you encounter an impassable iron 
gate, Blocked again! 

__< 

The adventurers need not worry too much 
as there is a prominent lever jutting fiom 
the wall to their left. Any two characters 
acting togcihei will be able to move the 
lever and open the gate, Then it is but a 
short walk to the rear of the secret door, 
which isclearly discernible from the inside, 
and thence to freedom!

In common with the olhcr mephits de 
scribed in the FIEND FOLIO(r) Tome , the 
ice and mist mephits are only lotmd on (he 
prime material plane while performing 
missions for their powerful masters on the 


lower planes. They share the general 
characteristics of these creatures (see FF 
p64-66) being tasteless, vulgar and cruel. 
They are always evil but may be chaotic, 
neutral, or lawful. 


Mist 

Mist mephits attack with two claws and a 
breath weapon, and have some spell-like 
abilities. 


Ice 

Ice mephits attack with two clawed bands 
and a breath weapon. 

The claw attacks inflict 1-2 hit points of 
damage each and also have a freezing effeci 
on the victim. For every successful attack 
made with a claw, the mephit's opponents 
must dedut l I from all to hit rolls due to the 
chilling ol their muscles. The effects are 
cumulative and last for 3 to-I turns 01 until 
the victim is restored to full hit points 
(whichever is the sooner). 

The breath weapon consists ol a volley of 
icy shards which automatically hit a single 
victim within 15 feet and inflict 1-6 hit 
points of damage (halved if save vs. 
Breath). The breath weapon may be used 
every othei round and up to three times jjci 
day. 

Once per hour an ice mephil may attempt 
to gate in another mephit with a 25% 
chance of success. The new arrival will be 
an ice or mist mephit (equal probability ol 
each type). 

Ice mephits are highly angular in form and 
have translucent, icy-blue flesh which 
gives them the appearance of crude ice 
sculptures. Normally, they will be encount 
ered only in cold areas. 



The claws are relatively soft, and inflict 
only I hit point of damage each. 

The breath weapon is the mephit's prefer 
red mode of attack. It takes the form ol a 
cloud of sickly-green, misty vapours which 
will totally envelope a single victim within 
10 leet. Unless the victim makes a succ essful 
saving throw vs. Poison he or she will 
suffer 2-5 hit points of damage from the 
effects of inhaling the vapours and will 
also be blinded for 1-1 rounds. The mephit 
can only breath in alternate rounds up to a 
maximum of three times per hour. 

A mist mephit can create a wall of fog 
(equivalent to the illusionist spell cast at 
3rd level) and assume gaseous form. Eac h 
of these abilit ies may be used only one e pet 
day. Mist or log does not interfere with a 
mephit's vision in any way. 

Once per hour a mist mephit may attempt 
to gate in 1-2 othei mephits (ice or mist, 
equal probability) with a 20% chance of 
success. 

The body of a mist mephit is pale grey and 
very rounded in appearance with poorly 
defined features. In addition, the mephit 
constantly exudes mist from its skin. This 
mist covers the mephit to a thickness of 
about an inch, and makes its form even 
more indistinct.

Splanxiies are mischievous waier-dwelling 
creatures related, it is said, to both nixies 
and leprechauns. They live in swift- 
moving bodies of water (mountain streams, 
rapids, waterfalls, and so on) and never 
move far from such torrents. They are never 
surprised and, while in contact with 
flowing water, ran hide so as to be 50% 
undetectable (cf. thief's hide in shadows 
ability). 


Although they are fairly intelligent, 
splanxiies are extremely childish and have 
a correspondingly irritating sense of 
humour. They delight in harrassiug and 
fooling people with practical jokes, harm- 
less traps and riddles, and will often 
arrogantly demand tribute in the form of 
gems. 


So long as a splanxty is not attacked and its 
victims provide it with amusement, it will 
not use any of its abilities in an aggressive 
manner. However, if those victims attack it 
or refuse to 'play along' it will attack 
wildly, in a fit of childish temper, using 
every means at its disposal. When so 
annoyed, the splanxty will usually (80% 
chance) jump up and down in irritation 
and so reveal its location.

EYE OF THE SERPENT 

by Graeme Morris 


Gazing down from the pinnacle of Hardway Moun 
tain, who would not be drawn by the far-off glint of 
the Serpent's Eye? The descent will be hard, the 
mountain knows neither mercy nor compassion. 
Many are the lessons to be learned, but fate has left 
you little choice - are you equal to the challenge? 

Eye of the Serpent is a one-on-one wilderness 
adventure module for one player and one Dungeon 
Master, and has been designed to develop the spe 
cialist skills of a first level druid, ranger, or monk 
character. It can also be used for a normal party of 4-6 
first level player characters. 

The perils of Hardway Mountain are unchanging, 
but the routes between them are not. This module 
includes a unique route planning system with differ 
ent of routes linking the encounters to challenge the 
abilities of druids, rangers, or monks. Alternately, 
Dungeon Masters can change the routings to create 
their own original and exciting adventures.
