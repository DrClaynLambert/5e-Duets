01-20 Imperfection has no positive or negative effects. 

21-30 Imperfection does not damage the functioning of the item, 
but docs mar it in a way that reduces its beauty (and thus its 
sale value). 

31-35 Item is rendered useless. 

36-40 Helpers other than assisting Adept (if any) injured during 
construction. Roll Id20 for damage which is applied di 
rectly to Endurance. GM should determine if the Adept's 
helpers (whether injured or not) wish to continue with the 
ritual and, if so, under what terms (usually better pay) they 
will do so. 

41-47 Shaper is injured during construction. Roll ld20 for dam 
age, applied its above. 

48-50 Assisting Adept (if any) is injured and takes Id 10 points of 
damage as above. GM should determine if the injured 
Adept wishes to continue the ritual. 

51-55 GM rolls Id 100. Item will function at that percentage of its 
intended original efficiency. For example, if an item was in 
tended to do damage and the GM rolls a 50, the item will 
do half the damage it would have done had the accident not 
occurred. If this result occurs more than once during the 
construction of a particular item, the item is completely use 
less. 

56-60 Item works as intended except that each time the item is 
used, the user must expend Id 10 Fatigue Points. The exact 
number to be expended is determined anew with each use 

61-85 Item will do something different from what was intended. 
What the item docs is up to the GM's discretion (although 
it should be related to the item's initial purpose). In any 
event, there is a 70% chance the item will be less useful 
than intended, and a 30% chance that it will be more use 
ful. 

86-91 Increase the efficiency of the item by ld5 (ldl0/2) times 
Any one aspect of what the item was intended to do may be 
increased, or the overall effectiveness may be increased, at 
the GM's discretion. 

92-93 The name of an entity from another plane was accidentally 
uttered during the rites of construction, and the being 
comes to the Shaper's workshop to wreak vengeance. There 
is a 70% chance that the entity will be a demon, devil, or 
imp, and a 30% chance that it will be something else of the 
GM's deciding. 

94-95 Item does the reverse ol what it was intended to do. The GM 
will have to decide whether this means the item will affect a 
different party than intended, or whether the reversal has a 
different effect. 

96-100 Item has been taken over by an entity from another plane 
(demon, devil, imp, hellhound, spectre, etc.). The item 
may force any wielder to attack his friends, or demand 
blood sacrifices, etc., at the GM's option. If the item was 
not intended to contain a spirit in the first place, the spirit 
has a 10% chance of breaking loose (leaving the item other 
wise undamaged) each time the item is used. 

Note: Each rime the GM rolls on the Shaping Accident Table, there is 
a 20 + (4 * Rank)% chance the Shaper will notice something has gone- 
wrong with the ritual. If an imperfection is noted, the Shaper has a 
chance equal to (5 x Rank)% of determining the exact nature of each 
individual imperfection (e.g. "The item has been taken over by a de- 
mon.''). If the result of this die roll is 30 or more higher than the 
Shaper's chance of detecting an imperfection, the Shaper will think 
lie has detected an imperfection (of the GM's choice) which, in ai tual 
fact, is not there. If an imperfection is noted and the Shaper decides 
to start again from scratch, there is a 40% chance the original materi 
als can be re-used.

Players' Adventure Background 


God's foot disappears! Priests baf 
fled! bellowed the bellman at the cor 
ner. By the morning, town criers and 
storytellers were ababble with the sen 
sational news of the mysterious disap 
pearance of a 5-foot-long stone foot. 
Local tradition declared it to be the 
only earthly remnant of the last physi 
cal manifestation on the Prime Mate 
rial Plane of Grumbar (an earth god, 
boss of the earth elementals). 

That same day, a letter is delivered 
to you, along with a sealed brass bot 
tle. The letter reads: 

A mutual friend has praised your 
skills highly. If you seek rich reward 
and the opportunity to delve into mys 
teries ancient and lost, bring this bot 
tle forthwith to my demesne in the 
village of Volkumburgh. Together, we 
may seek to bring mankind the lost 
wonder of the awtawmatawn. 

Amelior Amanitas (his mark) 

Wonderful-somebody you proba 
bly wouldn't remember has given your 
name to someone you don't know, 
who now wants you to help him find 
something you never heard of. Since 
you can't open the bottle (no matter 
what you try), you are tempted to toss 
the bottle on the trash heap out 
back-end of story. 


DM's Background of The Shattered 
Statue 

The specific aspects of magic are taught 
by specialized colleges. Two of these Col 
leges no longer exist. They were de 
stroyed by the Statue of Awtawmatawn, a 
magical creation of Valmous the Shaper, 
an Adept of the College of Shaping Mag 
ics. 

Valmous was completing the first of his 
awtawmatawns, gargantuan yet gentle 
stone golems, who, in the space of a few 
years, could advance the king's ambitious 
building projects by generations. During 
the final stage of the statue's creation, the 
spell backfired and a minor devil ap 
peared, taking over the statue. Unpre 


pared, the Shapers could not defend 
themselves adequately and most were 
slain. The gravely injured Valmous was 
driven away. 

Sensing one more magical college 
nearby, the awtawmatawn thundered 
over the mountains into the College of 
Rune Magics. The Rune Adepts were 
waiting, allied with Valmous. Valmous 
suspected the statue's weakness and 
guided his brothers in magic to destroy it. 

Even so, few survived the fierce battle 
and yet another College of Magic lay in 
ruins, its practitioners dead or scattered. 

With the aid of several young Rune 
Magic Adepts, Valmous hid the awtaw 
matawn's fragments. He could still detect 
the aura of the devil amongst the pieces. 
Were the statue to be reassembled, it 
would live again. Using their own magics 
and the Shaper's devices, the Rune 
Adepts placed the dying Valmous into a 
healing stasis trance, to awaken when the 
need arose. All then faded into history. 

Countless decades later, an excited Al 
chemist held his breath as his magical po 
tions welded the fragments of a colossal 
stone arm and its magical aura grew. The 
legends he had discovered were true. The 
ancients had indeed created a stone go 
lem of mythic proportions, and he, Ame 
lior Amanitas, would be the one to bring 
this wonder of the ages back into being, 
to serve mankind as the legends de 
scribed. He began excitedly scribbling 
notes again. He would need some brave 
heroic types to recover the lost fragments 
from the places the superstitious locals 
had hidden them in. If the rest of the 
pieces were even half as large as those he 
now had, he would need wagons ... big 
wagons. 

DRAGONQUEST(r) & AD&D(r) Game 
Rules 

The Shattered Statue is a combined 
DRAGON QUEST(tm) game (DQ rules 
hereafter) and ADVANCED DUNGEONS 
& DRAGONS(r) (AD&D(r)) game adven 
ture, set within the FORGOTTEN 
REALMS(tm) campaign setting and playable 
with both rule systems. Although the 
FORGOTTEN REALMS(tm) Cyclopedia and 
Sourcebook are not necessary to play this 


adventure, the DM may wish to study the 
history and geography of the country of 
Cormyr and its neighbors before running 
The Shattered Statue. 

DRAGONQUEST(r) rules players 
should take note that the acronym "DM" 
meaning "Dungeon Master" is used in 
place of "GM" which is used in 
DRAGONQUEST(r) rules to denote 
"Game Master." In non-game specific de 
scriptions, a magic-using character 
(Magic-User or Adept) is referred to by 
the DRAGONQUEST(r) rules term of 
"Adept." 

All dice-rolling in the DQ rules is 
based on a 10-sided die, but for this ad 
venture, DMs should have four, six, 
eight, 10 and 12-sided dice available dur 
ing play. Finally, the AD&D(r) game term 
"round" is used in place of the DQ 
rules term "pulse" to mean exchange of 
combat attacks. 

Where possible, similar monsters, trea 
sures, and tests of skill have been chosen. 
Still, the two game systems are different 
and often require separate explanations 
or rule clarifications. For clarity, the spe 
cific rules for both the AD&D(r) and DQ 
games are set apart from the rest of the 
adventure. 

DQ specific rules look like this: DQ 
rules: Make an Agility roll at a difficulty 
factor of 4 or fall into the pit. 

AD&D(r) game rules look like this: 

AD&D(r) game: Make a Dexterity Abil 
ity Check or fall into the pit. 

Preparing the Adventure 

As with any other adventure, read the 
booklet thoroughly before attempting to 
play. Whether you're playing with the 
DQ rules or the AD&D(r) game, read the 
descriptions of the Magic Colleges in the 
ARCANE WISDOM rule supplement in 
this module. 

All boxed text is to be read to the play 
ers at the moment of the corresponding 
encounter. Any other information con 
cerns the DM only. 

Set up the module cover as a DM 
screen. Pull out pages 21-28 containing 
DM maps and tables, player aids, and 


2 














prerolled characters. Four to eight charac 
ters should participate in the adventure. 

DQ rules: The characters should pos 
sess a broad range of the available skills, 
including weapon use, magic use, heal 
ing, alchemy, and thieving. At least one 
character should be an Adept of the Col 
lege of Celestial Magics. The characters 
should be Rank 4 or better in their spe 
cialty and Rank 2 or better in at least one 
other skill and Rank 5-6 in a primary 
weapon. 

AD&D(r)game: The players' party 
should total an average of 35 levels of 
experience, up to a maximum of 48. 
Each player character (PC) who be 
gins should gain at least one, possibly 
two, levels of experience if he or she 
survives the entire adventure. A vari 
ety of classes are needed during the 
quest-thieves, clerics, and magic- 
users in particular. 

DQ rules: When the DM must check 
for "surprise" during an encounter, the 
DM should make the roll based on the 
party leader's Perception ability x 3. 

Beginning the Adventure 

The events of The Shattered Statue take 
place in the Forgotten Realms country of 
Cormyr. Ideally, the party begins the ad 
venture in Suzail, capital of Cormyr. 

The bottle received by the party is 
highly magical; once sealed, it cannot be 
opened, damaged, or destroyed (or even 
lose its polish). 

If the bottle is thrown away, it and an 
identical note reappear the next day at 
the PCs' doorstep. 

Research provides the following infor 
mation: 

Found in a library or royal archives: 
Volkumburgh turns out to be a tiny vil 
lage, formerly a noble's villa, nestled in 
the foothills of the Thunder Peaks south 
of Thunder Gap, but it appears only on 
maps at least 200 years old! 

Found in conversation with a powerful 
Adept: Amelior Amanitas was or is an al 
chemist and an Adept of some note. He is 
known to the Adept questioned, al 
though by his unusual reputation only. 


Found only by a hired sage: A single 
entry in an obscure government docu 
ment dated three centuries ago (from the 
reign of the Elder Kings) refers to the aw- 
tawmatawn: 

... the Adept Valmous promised that 
the awtawmatawn, as gigantic as the leg 
endary Statues that Walk of fabled 
Mulhorand, would be able to dredge 
lakes, build bridges and carry greater 
loads faster than two hundreds of the 
king's laborers. Upon hearing this, King 
Proster did assign the College of Shaping 
Magics at Volkumburgh the task of build 
ing for him an awtawmatawn ... 

The DM may also wish to provide the 
party with a map of the country sketched 
from DM Map 1 of the Forgotten Realms. 

Accepting the mission described in the 
note takes the adventurers to Volkum 
burgh in the high valley south of Thun 
der Gap in the southern Thunder Peaks 
range (see DM Map 1). 

When the PCs decide to accept the 
mission, a second brass bottle is delivered 
the following morning, labeled "open 
me now." When opened, a sack of coins 
appears in a poof of mist (DQ rules: 50 
gold shillings; AD&D(r) game: 1,200 
g.p.) accompanied by a map with a note 
(Players' Map 1). Give Players' Map 1 to 
the party at this time. 

The note says: 


It took you long enough to make up 
your minds. One can only hope you 
will be more prompt in future matters. 
Meet me in Volkumburgh before the 
Feast of the Moon. 

Amelior Amanitas 


Whether the party has encounters be 
fore reaching the trail leading up the 
mountain to Volkumburgh is left to the 
DM's discretion. It should take the party 
about a month to find the village. The 
events in Volkumburgh begin late in the 
month of Uktar before the Feast of the 
Moon (corresponding to November or 
late fall). 

When the party has reached the foot of 
the trail up to Volkumburgh, go to Chap 
ter One. 


Wandering Monsters & 

Statistics 

Combined Statistics Tables for monsters 
and NPCs in the adventure are to be 
found on the inside cover and on page 25 
of the pull-out section. 
DRAGONQUEST(r) rules DMs may be un 
familiar with this arrangement, which pro 
vides vital gameplay statistics for each 
monster. Armor is either natural armor 
(N.A.) or is commonly worn armor. EN 
and FT are Endurance and Fatigue. Most 
monsters use the average statistics found in 
the DQ rules. Weapon(s) are the mon 
ster's most commonly used weapons and 
have a Rank and Dmg (Damage) modifier 
for each. BC % is the Base Chance the mon 
ster has to score a hit with the selected 
weapon (includes Rank and Manual Dex 
terity). MV/TMR is the monster's move 
ment speed and Tactical Movement Rate 
for combat. PAGE is the page that the 
monster can be found on in both the 1st 
and 2d edition DRAGONQUEST(r) mles. 
Finally, College refers to any Magical Col 
leges of which the monster may be a prac- 
tioner. 

Random encounters appear in the Ran 
dom Encounters Table on the inside 
cover. Each column on the Random En 
counters Table corresponds to a specific 
area or time during the adventure. Each 
chapter of the adventure indicates which 
column to use in this table and the fre 
quency of encounter checks. The table in 
dicates whether or not an encounter will 
occur and the nature of the encounter 
with a single die roll. The number of crea 
tures encountered is listed in parentheses 
next to each entry.

The events of The Shattered Statue hinge 
closely upon the actions of three NPCs of 
greater power than the PCs: Amelior 
Amanitas, the Alchemist who is to be the 
PCs' patron; Valmous the Shaper, who 
seeks to prevent his magic from being re 
created; and Lychor, the Agent of Dark 
ness, who has instigated the resurrection 
of the evil golem. 

Lychor's actions are most important, 
since he causes things to happen when 
the players don't or won't. 

Due to space limitations, we cannot list 
all the AD&D(r) rules magical spells availa 
ble to the NPCs-just the spells they must 
have. The DM must add any other spells he 
feels appropriate to the characters. 

Amelior Amanitas 

DQ rules: Amelior Amanitas is 
Moon-aspected.

Notes: Amelior Amanitas is a master Al 
chemist, noted more for his peculiarities 
than his prowess. Roleplay him as a bum 
bling, good-natured eccentric. 

He is also a rarity, an Adept who has 
studied two Colleges of Magic, Naming 
Incantations and Ensorcelments and En 
chantments. Although good-hearted, 
Amelior does not serve the Powers of 
Light (Good). Amelior is a tall, chunky 
man with short, brown but graying, curly 
hair and beard, one eye and spectacles. 
He wears the rumpled garb of a common 
craftsman rather than the extravagant 
robes of a powerful Adept. 

Amelior surrounds himself with ex 
traordinary clutter, keeps a dozen 
brightly colored (red, green, fuschia ...) 
cats, and is outrageously absent-minded. 

He does not flaunt his skills and often 
appears to be a bumbler. 

Amelior is straightforward in his deal 
ings. He attempts to cheat no one, even 
though he may forget that he has hired 


someone. He rarely uses magic against a 
sentient being, and then only in self de 
fense. He carries no weapons, but instead 
has a pair of magical flasks-one gold and 
the other copper. Each flask may be used 
once. When the gold flask is opened, a 
djinn named Hasan appears to do Ame- 
lior's bidding. When the copper flask is 
opened, it unleashes two ogres who are 
fanatically devoted to the Alchemist. 
They fight like berserkers until killed. 
Upon death, they become ogre zombies 
(DQ rules: they retain ogre characteris 
tics; AD&D(r) game: monster zombies) 
and fight until destroyed. In a pinch, 
Amelior is fast with his flasks. 

AD&D(r) game: Amelior is a Sage 
whose Major field of study is the Phys 
ical Universe (Chemistry and Physics) 
and minor field of study is Supernatu 
ral & Unusual.

Notes: Valmous is the only surviving

and is also a Rune Adept. He serves the 
Powers of Light (Good) and reawakens 
from his centuries-long slumber upon 
sensing the reconstruction of his greatest 
creation, the awtawmatawn. Valmous 
does not want the golem to be reassem 
bled, since it originally destroyed the two 
lost Colleges of Magic and their mem 
bers. 

Valmous's hero's physique and good 
looks are marred by his permanent frown. 
His hair and beard reveal his great age; 
both are long and white. His clothing is 
ragged and crumbling, as if he had risen 
from the grave. 

In combat against foes he is not con 
vinced are evil, Valmous never kills.

Notes: Lychor is middle-aged, slender 
with dark hair and a small mustache. He 
is good-looking, good-natured and al 
ways quick with a cheerful laugh. Yet if 
crossed or foiled, his humor is replaced by 
vengeful fury that remains unabated un 
til his foe is utterly destroyed. 

Lychor is an agent for the Powers of 
Darkness (Evil) and has made the Greater 
Pact with these powers. These evil powers 
shield Lychor from all spells that would 
detect his true nature. 

Lychor began his career as a priest of 
Bane, but changed professions when he 
realized the power he could wield as an 
Adept. He now sells his skills and has 
worked for the Red Wizards of Thay, the 
Zhentarim and Lashan of Scardale. 

The Zhentarim, a group of evil men 
who seek power through evil deeds, are 
his current employers. They wish to recre 
ate the awtawmatawn and release its de 
structive fury on Cormyr and the 
Dalelands. It was Lychor who found the 
first pieces of the shattered statue and 
provided Amelior with fragmentary leg 
ends about it. 

He is always accompanied by Anabis, his 
familiar, in the form of a raven (DQ rules: 
a minor devil, AD&D(r) game: an imp). 

Remember, Lychor's mission is to re 
create the awtawmatawn. If necessary, he 
will put it back together himself, but he 
will not sacrifice himself. 

* He does not wear the demon helm un 
til the Wizard War in Chapter Four.

CHAPTER ONE: The Alchemist's Quest 



Encounter Setting 

This chapter's goal is for the PCs to meet 
Lychor and Amelior (major NPCs) and to 
undertake the quest for the five missing 
awtawmatawn pieces. Be careful not to 
reveal Lychor's true nature any earlier 
than Chapter Four-Lychor wants the 
PCs to think him a friend. 

Less than two months ago, the adven 
turers were in a nice warm city. Now, they 
find themselves on a trail leading south 
from Thunder Gap towards the lately in 
significant Village of Volkumburgh (see 
Maps 2 and 7). 

Volkumburgh is a herding village. The 
inhabitants trade wool and sheep for 
what they cannot produce themselves. 
The villagers know how to find the lost 
Magic Colleges and the Temple of the 
Dragon Oracle. 

Until recently, they have been looting 
the colleges and selling the relics they 
find. Now, the awtawmatawn activity has 
attracted "things" to the colleges that 
keep them out. 

Knowledge of the temple was forced 
upon them by Flashfire, a red dragon 
who recently took up residence in the 
mountains to the south. Once every 
month, the villagers take five sheep to 
Mount Drakkor Rouge. This token of 
supplication keeps Flashfire away. 

Begin rolling daily for weather (see 
page 25) and Random Encounters. The 
feast of the Moon is still weeks away, but 
winter comes early to the high valleys of 
the Thunder Peaks. 

The terrain is rugged, but the path up 
the valley is clear. If the snow on the 
ground is less than three inches deep, 
there is no chance of being lost. At 4-6 
inches, there is a one-in-ten chance for 
the party to become lost and veer 60 de 
grees (one hex side) off course. Each addi 
tional 2 inches of snow increases this 
chance by 1. In heavy snow (or worse), the 
party has 1-4 chance on a d 10 (plus modi 
fiers for snow depth) to become lost. 

If the PCs become hopelessly lost, they 
are found by Lychor, leading a search 
party of grumpy villagers. 


Random Encounters in 
Volkumburgh Vale 

These encounters occur whenever the 
party is traveling in Volkumburgh Vale. 
Use the Volkumburgh Vale column, 
checking for encounters every six hours. 

Jeopardy!: Roll again on the encounter 
table. The creatures determined by the 
roll (excepting peasants) are attacking or 
threatening a group of peasants (herders 
or even a mother and child). The party 
might wish to save the poor folks. 

Red Dragon: Flashfire flies high over 
head, ignoring all on the ground. Fliers 
attract his attention and he will buzz 
them once. He attacks here only if at 
tacked himself (see Chapter Three for 
dragon combat details). 

Wights (ldlO): As dusk settles, wights 
spring from hiding places amongst the 
snow and rocks. If a wight scores a hit, it 
howls with glee, then disappears into the 
gloom. 

Gargoyles (ld4 + 1): These are minions 
of Flashfire, the red dragon. They raid 
the valley, even if the dragon's tribute is 
paid. For dealing with the gargoyles, see 
encounter #V8, demon's Place, in the 
Village of Volkumburgh. 

Peasants (ld4 + l): These fellows and 
their three dogs are driving 50 sheep 
down from mountain pastures towards 
the village. (Make a dlOO roll. There is a 
30% chance that they are returning with 
out sheep from Mount Drakkor Rouge af 
ter taking their monthly tribute to the 
dragon.) They are friendly, but not too 
curious-just happy for the protection. 
They become silent if Amelior or the aw 
tawmatawn are discussed. 

Blizzard, Ice storm, Wind storm: The 
sudden onset of severe weather threatens 
all caught in it. The temperature drops to 
extreme cold. See the Weather section on 
page 25. Also, roll a d20. On a result of 
18-20, another Random Encounter occurs 
simultaneously with the weather change. 

Encounter Key-Map 2 

Tl. Engarde! 

It is snowing lightly (cold and cloudy) 
as the party reaches encounter area #Tl, a 


deep,narrow ravine, the only way up the 
valley. Read the following: 


The chill wind whips the falling 
snow into a frothy fury as it blows at 
you through the narrow pass ahead. 
Without warning, blurred forms wing 
above the cliffs and hulking shapes 
hurl boulders at you. 

The attackers are two ancient men on 
wyverns who lead a dozen neanderthals 
(AD&D(r) game: cavemen). The an 
cients are the last of the Rune Adepts- 
followers and caretakers of the sleeping 
Valmous. They challenge strangers enter 
ing the valley to prevent Amelior from re 
ceiving new statue pieces. In their cracked 
voices they call the party "evil ones" and 
"bringers of doom." 

Roll a Surprise Check for the party. If 
the PCs are surprised, the Rune Adepts 
and their allies may attack once with no 
return attack. 

If the party approaches Volkumburgh 
from the air, the Rune Adepts drop from 
the sky and attempt to force the PCs to 
the ground where the neanderthals wait 
(AD&D(r) game: wyverns are class E 
manueverability in air combat). 

The Rune Adepts are armed with 
Runeweapons (Runesticks transformed 
into lances and daggers). Made of yew 
wood, these weapons are deadly poison 
ous if they score a hit (ID 10-2 points of 
poison damage per round for ID 10 
rounds). AD&D(r) game: only fighters 
and thieves and other Rune Adepts 
may use these Rune weapons.

The Rune Adepts have padded armor, 
poisonous dagger and lance (Rune- 
weapons), Ebony Rod Runewand *, 
various Runesticks. 

* The Ebony Rod Runewand penal 
izes the spell target's saving

tions as a wand of paralyzation. 

Spells: 

Level 1: Charm person (x2), magic 
missile (x2). 

Level 2: Darkness, phantasmal force. 
Level 3: Dispel magic, monster sum 
moning I. 

The neanderthals on the ridge above 
the ravine are armed with clubs and boul 
ders (to hurl from above). They will only 
descend to attack if most of the party is 
obviously injured. 

If the Rune Adepts are tremendously 
outclassed by the party, add one more 
Adept (total of three) and another eight 
neanderthals. If the battle goes against 
the NPCs, they flee to the Rune Portal 
(out of sight at Area if 2) and retreat to the 
College of Rune Magics. 

If a Rune Adept is captured and ques 
tioned (alive or dead), refer to Chapter 
Two: The Shaper's Shards. 

If the battle goes against the party (that 
is, they are in serious danger of extinc 
tion), Lychor (see NPCs section) arrives 
from Volkumburgh and aids the PCs. He 
performs only those magics that could be 
explained away as priestly miracles. If his 
help is not needed, he greets the party af 
ter the battle. 

T2. Rune Portal 

If the PCs decide to pursue fleeing 
Rune Adepts or see where they came 
from, the trail in the snow leads to a place 
where the footsteps mysteriously end. 



Humanoid and dragonish foot 
prints in the snow lead towards and 
away from a single wooden stick thrust 
into the ground here. 

The stick is a Runestick (made of wil 
low wood) and carved with Rune Portal 
Runes. This magical stick is the terminus 
(end point) of a special teleportation 
spell. Any character (or creature) who 
touches it (and any object that it is touch 
ing) is instantly teleported to the Wyvern 
Cave (area #2) of the College of Rune 
Magics (Map 3). 

The Runestick cannot be removed or 
physically broken. Only the proper magic 
spell will destroy it (DQ rules: Special 
Knowledge Counterspell for the College 
of Rune Magics; AD&D(r) game: dispel 
magic). 

If any Rune Adepts survive, one re 
mains behind to destroy the Rune Stick to 
prevent the PCs from following. He then 
tries to escape (on his wyvern). 

T3. Volkumburgh 

All major paths and trails lead to the 
Village of Volkumburgh, the goal of their 
trek. Upon reaching the village, give the 
players playing aid til, the Map of 
Volkumburgh. 


'Ybu find yourselves on the outskirts 
of Volkumburgh, a small, rustic vil 
lage built from the remains of an an 
cient villa. Small, snow-covered stone 
buildings line the villa's ancient walls. 
Through the great open gate you see a 
miniature town green and an inn. But 
the whole town is dominated by one 
huge, tall building unlike all the oth 
ers. 


The inn is the Crimson Wyrm and the 
huge, unique building is Amelior 
Amanitas's workshop. The rest are all 
nondescript peasant cottages, barns, and 
sheds-some larger than others. 


their private taboos-Magical Colleges, 
Amelior Amanitas, the awtawmatawn, 
its hand, or the dragon. 

Unfortunately, it is just this informa 
tion that the PCs need to pursue their 
mission (should they choose to accept it). 
This is a role-playing problem. No 
amount of combat will solve it. Threaten 
ing these peasants just makes them more 
stoic and standoffish. 

To gain the villagers' trust, create and 
stage a mini scenario, such as a bold 
herder approaches the party about killing 
some marauding gargoyles; or in the 
dead of night two groups of wights (see 
Random Encounters) attack, killing vil 
lagers; or Red Rudyard, the villager head 
man (see the Crimson Wyrm Inn), asks 
the party if they've ever slain a dragon. 

Encounter Key-Map 7 

VI. Peasant Cottages 

Unless the PCs are given explicit direc 
tions how to find a named place on the 
map, such as cottages belonging to 
Wistkins, Deker or demon, any hut they 
encounter is a generic peasant's hut. 

Each cottage contains a family group of 
ld6 peasants (half those in the household 
are children). There is a two-in-six chance 
that an adult male in the family has mili 
tia experience (DQ rules: Pike at Rank 
2; AD&D(r) game: 1st level fighter 
armed with pike). Unless the PCs insult 
or injure the peasants, the peasants will 
aid them in whatever way they can, hop 
ing to gain a silver piece or two. 

If the characters state they are carefully 
scanning the contents of a cottage, they 
will note unusual objects like nice dag 
gers, small sculptures, glass balls, etc. 
These have been looted from the Magical 
Colleges (there is a one-in-ten chance 
that the item is magical, DM's choice). 
However, unless coerced, the peasants 
will just say they "found them some 
where." 


Getting to Know the Villagers 
The peasants of Volkumburgh are 
friendly enough, unless you talk about 


7 















V2. The Town Green 


The old villa's courtyard is the town 
green. Slushy snow surrounds a ruined 
stone gazebo where water from an ar 
tesian well bubbles up into an icy 
fountain, then collects in a large sculp 
tured cistern that looks like an ancient 
stone sarcophagus. 


The water is pure and of course, icy 
cold. If the sarcophagus is pushed aside 
(after chipping the ice away), the fingers 
of a stone hand will be seen (the awtaw- 
matawn's hand). If PCs try to detect 
magic (DQ rules: Detect Aura; AD&D(r) 
game: detect magic ) on the hand it can 
be detected as magical. It is part of the 
awtawmatawn. 

V3. The Crimson Wyrm 


The manor house has been rebuilt 
and repaired and now bears the sign of 
a winged red snake. The word "wel 
come" has been painstakingly lettered 
in the common, elvish, and dwarvish 
tongues on the door. The smell of hot, 
simple food is strong here. 


The Crimson Wyrm, the village's only 
inn, welcomes travelers. A warm drink, 
hot food, a soft bed, and friendly com 
pany can be found here. Red Rudyard is 
the proprietor and the village headman. 
As the PCs enter, he ladles hot mulled ci 
der from a kettle and says "the first one is 
on the house." 

Prices here are cheap (even after Red 
Rudyard inflates them). An excellent 
meal costs 3 coppers, a drink 2 coppers, 
and night's lodging another 5 coppers. 
The Wyrm has four guest rooms (one is 
already occupied by Lychor). Each guest 
room has two single beds. Guests who 
provide their own bedroll may sleep in 
the common room for a copper. Horses 
are stabled and fed for 5 coppers a day. 

The 'Wyrm is also the local dry goods 
store. Rudyard has any equipment that 
may be used in day-to-day living by com 
mon people. His prices are half the listed 
price (a block and tackle-10 SP/g.p.). 


There is a 20% chance that he will have a 
common weapon (like a sword). Twice the 
listed price must be paid for weapons. 

The locals are surprisingly open with 
strangers until their "taboos" are men 
tioned. After that, the cheer in the room 
is somewhat reduced. 

However, if the PCs listen instead of 
talk, they may hear the following (at the 
DM's discretion): 

"Seen any a' Wistkins?" "Nah. He's 
gone ta'lookin' fer ol' Volki's treasure 
agin."-"Volki's treasure" refers to the 
treasure of the Volkumburghs, hidden 
before its sacking 200 years ago and never 
found again. The locals think it is hidden 
in a cave. True, but the cave is beneath 
the 'Wyrm. 

"Deker found 'nuther a'them funny 
sticks stuck in the ground when he was 
a'clearing out the ruins up in High Pas 
ture fer his new barn. Sheep went ta chaw 
it and just was gone. Shrimp sez One-eye 
ain't got time fer such stuff, so jis 
leave't'alone."-Deker has found a ter 
minus for a Rune Portal. "One-eye" re 
fers to Amelior Amanitas. 

"Demons hit demon's place again. 
Grabbed two sheep and flew south." 

Lychor's Room at the Inn 

The door is locked. The room is neat 
and orderly. The bed does not appear 
slept in and is covered with a layer of 
dust. Lychor's Imp familiar, Anabis, 
guards the room in raven form. In the 
chest by the bed are duplicates of Ame 
lior's awtawmatawn plans and notes. Be 
neath the papers is a carefully hidden 
symbol of the god Bane (an open black 
hand upon a scarlet background). A book 
marked with what is obviously an Adept's 
personal symbol contains Lychor's listed 
magical spells. Lychor will return in ld3 
turns (units of 10 minutes), summoned 
by his familiar. 

V4. The Alchemist's Workshop 

The Alchemist's workshop should be 
easy to find; it's the biggest, most unu 
sual building in the village. 


The huge building shows signs of 
being recently constructed. Over the 
heavy oaken door, a modest, 
elegantly-painted nameplate reads: 

A. Amanitas 

Alchemist 

Yet, it is the large sign nailed to the 
door that commands attention: 

DANGER KEEP OUT 


The door is locked, bolted, and barred 
from the inside. If the PCs examine the 
door frame, they will find it marked with 
numerous alchemical and magical sym 
bols and numerous repetitions of Ame- 
lior's personal magical symbol (matching 
the symbol on their map). 

If the PCs attempt to force the door (by 
magical or physical means) they are af 
flicted by Amelior's magical defense (see 
"Looting the Alchemist" at the end of 
this chapter). 

If the party merely knocks or yells 
"hello," etc., read the following: 


A previously undetected door in the 
side of the building, about 10 feet 
away, opens and a small gnome-like 
face peers out, blinking rapidly. 

"Oh, its just you. Thought it was 
someone important. Well, come in, 
come in. We've been waiting. You're 
half an hour late and we don't have all 
day, thank you." 


Encounter Key-Map 6-inset 2 

V4A. Walk-in Closet. 

If the party follows his impatient or 
ders, the little man ushers them inside. 


You follow the little man into a 
small, dimly lit room, cluttered with 
books, scrolls, cartons, jars, canisters, 
boxes, bags, bottles, exotically- 
colored cats (red, pink, blue, etc.)- 
and a lot of dust. Every movement in 
here stirs up great, dry clouds of it. 
There are no other doors. 


8 



















Sneezing violently, the little man 
opens the doors of a wardrobe against 
one wall and walks into it, pushing 
past the clothing hanging inside. 
"Mind you don't snag the fabric," he 
snaps. 


V4B. Loft of the Colossus 
When the PCs pass through the ward 
robe, they walk out onto a high platform 
in a huge chamber: 


This cavernous chamber seems even 
bigger than the barn's outside dimen 
sions. Glowing globes on pedestals 
around the edge of the room do little 
to push back the gloom. You also seem 
to be in a loft looking down on a com 
plex scaffolding that surrounds a dark, 
gigantic and vaguely humanoid 
shape. From within the scaffolding, a 
cheerful voice calls out "Erek, is that 
them? Bring them on down. Do they 
have the bottle? Go tell brother Lychor 
to bring lunch for ... um ... however 
many of them there are. Hurry man!" 

Erek leaves grumbling. 


The Awtawmatawn 

The way to Amelior is across a narrow, 
wobbly cat walk, and down a ladder into 
the gloom below. The scaffolding sur 
rounds a giant statue that is missing its 
head, an arm, a leg and ... a foot. 

The dark stone awtawmatawn would 
be 30 feet tall if its head were in place. It 
is not possible to find cracks between the 
fragments that make up the colossus. Its 
"skin" is seamless. Still, the pieces can be 
found. Some retain their original texture, 
others have been carefully polished, 
while still more have been weathered by 
time. 

The statue is occupied by the devil Rot- 
bite (see Chapter Four). Its native magic 
resistance foils any attempts to detect evil 
on the statue. 

Before the party enters the scaffolding 
(the only way down), stress how rickety it 
seems. As the party climbs onto the scaf 
folding, read the following: 


The boards beneath your feet wob 
ble and creak. Suddenly, a huge 
sphere with a single huge glowing eye 
and a number of smaller ones appears 
before you in the scaffolding. 

It is not a beholder (a giant spheroid 
monster capable of attacking with magi 
cal rays), just a bladder inflated and 
painted to look like one. Any bladed or 
fiery attack causes it to burst loudly. Ame 
lior put it there to hold the place of the 
awtawmatawn's head. He thinks it is 
funny. If the party attacks it (or runs 
away), Amelior will still be wiping away 
tears of laughter when they reach the 
floor. 

Amelior regains his composure and ex 
citedly demands the brass bottle. Once 
he has it, he motions all to stand back and 
merely flicks the cap off with his thumb 
("How'd he do that?"). There is a dra 
matic puff of smoke and a 5-foot-long 
stone foot appears in the room (the stolen 
"god's" foot from the temple in Suzail). 

The alchemist becomes even more ex 
cited, dashing hither and thither under 
neath the scaffolding, grabbing charts, 
diagrams, and scrolls. Breathlessly, he at 
last asks the PCs to follow him into a 
room cluttered with mismatched chairs 
on wheels. The Alchemist invites his 
guests to sit. There always seems to be one 
more person than there are chairs. 


Amelior looks at you with an excited 
gleam in his eye and says, "I need your 
help and I can reward you greatly for 
that help. This should cover the trip 
up here." He reaches into a pocket and 
pulls out five red gems, each as big as 
his thumb and tosses them to one of 
you. 

"The statue you saw in there is the 
awtawmatawn of ancient legend. It 
was created over 200 years ago by Val- 
mous the Shaper, the legendary mas 
ter of the College of Shaping Magics. 
That Magic College and the College of 
Rune Magics were located right here in 
the Thunder Peaks, possibly in 


Volkumburgh Vale itself. The awta- 
matawn was Valmous's greatest and 
last creation. 

"Valmous created it for an ancient 
king of Cormyr. It would have been 
used to build great public works: cas 
tles and colleges, harbors and hospi 
tals. Yet it was not to be so. On the day 
of its final shaping, it was destroyed by 
unknown and most likely evil forces. 
These same forces probably destroyed 
the two lost Magic Colleges and 
Volkumburgh Villa, since neither Val 
mous, the awtawmatawn nor any of 
these places were ever heard from 
again. 

"Good brother Lychor first brought 
this legend to my attention and since 
then, I've devoted all my energy to re 
constructing the awtawmatawn-for 
the betterment of humanity of course. 

"As you saw, my work is nearly 
complete. With each piece, like the 
marvelous foot you brought me, the 
magical aura within the statue grows. 
When complete, it will once again 
come into magical life." 

Amelior offers you a reward equal to 
the first for each of the remaining five 
pieces that make up its head, arm and 
leg. He suggests that those pieces may 
accompany other treasures, in which 
he, of course, would have little inter 
est. 


The five red gems (rubies!) are VERY 
valuable, worth 5,000 SP/g.p. each. 
Amelior has promised this much for each 
piece found, or a potential of 125,000 
SP/g.p. more, plus looting privileges! 

Unfortunately, he has exhausted all 
known locations of statue fragments. He 
knows that the remainder are somewhere 
in and around Volkumburgh Vale. A lo 
cal tale tells of a giant hand hidden here 
in the village. Amelior believes that the 
other pieces are in the two lost Colleges 
and an equally legendary place called the 
Temple of the Dragon Oracle, a shrine of 
the outlawed Dragon Cult. 

To move the pieces, Amelior provides 
two more brass bottles like the one the

party delivered earlier and a large wagon 
with a foursome of oxen. To make the 
flask work, touch an object and say "Into 
the flask you go ...and the name of the 
object. The desired object is then magi 
cally transported inside the flask. How 
ever, the flasks have only a 60% chance of 
working and living creatures may resist as 
they would a magical spell. 

And finally, Erek has to go along. It'll 
do him good. 

If the party agrees to Amelior's terms, 
he aids them further by giving each PC a 
potion of his or her choice (BQ rules: 
These potions will be Rank 5 spells from 
any of the original 12 Colleges of magic. 
The restrictions on the potions are that 
they must be imbibed and can affect only 
the drinker. No cast check is needed when 
imbibing a potion; AD&D(r) game: any 
standard potion.)

Erek possesses a short sword +2, 
and potions of healing, invisibility, and 
speed. 

Notes: Once a famous and important 
person, Erek was cursed to diminish in 
stature, personality, and attractiveness 
each time he was unkind, thoughtless, or 
unpleasant to another creature. When he 
came to Amelior, he was a hideous thing 
barely three inches tall. Amelior could 
not remove the curse, so he taught Erek to 
overcome it. Erek grows in stature and 
comeliness each time he is kind. 

Throughout the adventure, Erek will 
avoid combat or just barely survive death 
blows, etc. He should survive or at least 


be resurrected in order to play a part in 
the adventure's final chapter. 

Collecting from Amelior 

The Alchemist promises 25,000 SP/ 
g.p. in gems per statue piece. For the first 
piece returned, he has the gems ready 
and waiting. Thereafter, he is so wrapped 
up in reassembling the statue, that there 
is only a 30 % chance that he will have the 
gems handy. 

If pressed for payment, he says not to 
worry, it's somewhere in his office. After 
all, he's not going anywhere, is he? He'll 
have it next time. If the party refuses, 
even after negotiation, to return with 
more pieces until paid, Amelior finds a 
bag containing about Id 10x1,000 SP/ 
g.p. worth of gems and asks if this will do 
until he finds the rest. 

Looting the Alchemist 

If anyone tries to break into Amelior's 
barn, relieve him of his gems, or decides 
to search the office without permission, 
they are subjected to the Alchemist's 
strange spells. If they fail to resist the cast 
ing of a magic spell, they are shrunken to 
a mere 3 inches tall and left to fend for 
themselves. No specific descriptions are 
given for this, but imagine a rat as big as a 
horse, wolf-sized cockroaches, and multi 
colored cats like deadly, quick-striking 
dragons. 

Amelior finds the PCs before they all 
get themselves killed. He agrees to negate 
the spell if the PCs give their solemn word 
to find the lost pieces-but at only 
10,000 SP/g.p. a piece. 

V5. High Pasture 

The tumbledown ruins of an old barn 
or workshop contain another Runestick 
similar to the one found near the Rune 
Adept ambush. This is another Rune Por 
tal, leading to the illusionary Temple of 
Selune at of the College of Rune Magics 
(area #R1 on Map 3). 

V6. Wistkin's Cottage 

The hut is cold and empty. A search 
produces a piece of slate that looks like a 
crude map south into the Thunder Peaks. 
Volkumburgh and the colleges are clearly 


marked. 

V7. Deker's Cottage 

Deker is one of the shepherds whose 
name was overheard in the 'Wyrm. If 
asked, he willingly takes the party to the 
unusual stick at High Pasture. He is curi 
ous about the strange stick that made his 
sheep disappear. 

V8. demon's Place 

demon is a relatively prosperous sheep 
herder whose name the PCs may have 
overhead at the inn. He has been hit 
three times in the last two weeks by what 
he calls "demons'' (Flashfire's gargoyles) 
who carry off his sheep. If the party waits 
in hiding here for at least three hours, 
they may challenge the gargoyles, who 
land to steal more sheep. If the gargoyles 
outnumber the attackers, they fight, oth 
erwise they flee. A gargoyle will always 
flee if it takes 50% damage. 

Captured gargoyles talk tough, telling 
about their boss the dragon and how he's 
gonna come and stomp this place. How 
ever, if forced, they reveal the location of 
Mount Drakkor Rouge and the Colleges. 
If asked about giant statue pieces, gar 
goyles remember seeing, "... a big head 
in da smoke pit, da one dat scares da 
dragon." 

If a gargoyle is freed, the dragon re 
turns in ld3 days to wreak havoc.

Encounter Setting 

Unless the PCs have vowed to slay the 
dragon, they will probably search the vil 
lage for the hand. To find the other 
pieces, they must find and explore the 
lost Colleges and the Dragon Temple. 

Finding the Hand 

If the players forget Amelior's comment 
about one piece being hidden in the vil 
lage, have him or Erek mention it again. 
The hand lies beneath the fountain in the 
Town Green (#V 1 on Map 7). A well-paid 
villager will repeat the brief legend: 


"Long ago a stranger brought a gi 
ant stone hand to lord Volkumburgh 
and said that he must hide it, for oth 
ers would come to find it. Legend says 
that Lord Volkumburgh buried the 
hand and his vast treasure with soft 
earth, fine stone and deep water." 

"Soft earth" is dirt, "fine stone" is the 
carved sarcophagus, and "deep water" is 
artesian well water. 

Finding and Traveling to the Colleges 
Most adult male villagers know the way to 
the Colleges. They've been looting the 
ruins for centuries. It is a trial of passage 
to bring back a salable object from the ru 
ins. 

Two Rune Portals (magical teleporta 
tion devices) near the village will also take 
characters to the College of Rune 
Magics-see Rune Portal (#T2) and High 
Pasture (#V5) in Chapter One. 

If the party elects to go overland, they 
may want to hire a guide (see Chapter 
One Encounter Setting). Or, PCs with 
Ranger skills may scout about until they 
find the villagers' trails (these folks have 
been looting the ruins for generations- 
they've left trails). The trails are wide 
enough for the PCs' wagon. 

Remember, it is winter and monsters 
stalk the valley. Continue to roll for ran 
dom encounters and check the weather in 
the vale. Land travel won't be easy. 

If the PCs use Rune Portals to go to the 
College of Rune Magics, their reception 


will depend on the timing of their 
entry-see the descriptions for the Tem 
ple of Selune (#R1) and Rune Portal 
Again (#R2) on Map 3. 

Approaching the Colleges 

Both Colleges are situated on wide nat 
ural ledges on opposite sides of a side val 
ley south of the Vale of Volkumburgh (see 
Map 2). From the valley, the only way to 
reach the Colleges is to climb the 20-foot 
wide stairs that ascend to each ... or fly. 

The stairs are carved into the stone 
cliff. They switch back and forth across 
the cliff, climbing up from the trails in 
the valley. A stair takes an hour to climb 
and 40 minutes to descend. The stairs are 
enchanted to allow wagons to be pulled 
up it as if they were smooth inclined 
planes, taking three hours. Still, there is a 
one-in-twenty chance each hour that an 
accident will occur. 

If an accident occurs, roll ldlO to de 
termine the scope of the accident: 1-4- 
wagon breaks down, repairable in ld4 
hours. 3-6-wagon breaks irreparably. 7- 
8-wagon goes over the cliff with oxen. 
No one is injured. 9 - as above, but ld4 
randomly selected characters each receive 
2d6 points of damage. 10-as above, but 
affected characters must make saving rolls 
(DQ rules: 4xAgility Check; AD&D(r) 
game: Dexterity ( + 1) Check). Failure 
to make the roll means the character goes 
over the edge (see Falling Off a Cliff be 
low). 

The Colleges are both in ruins, 
pounded to rubble by the awtawmatawn. 

Falling Off a Cliff 

If a character falls off a cliff without his 
or her fall being stopped, roll ldlO. If the 
result is less than 9, the character is dead. 
On a 9 or 10 the character is unconscious, 
but has lost all but ld3 Endurance 
points/hit points. 

Roleplaying Lychor and Erek 

Erek, Amelior's unpleasant little assist 
ant, does not enjoy the adventure. How 
ever, he is quick to catch details that the 
party misses (like scratches in the floors of 
caves). He will make snide remarks every 
chance he gets (remember to make him 


shrink). 

Lychor watches the party at all times. If 
the PCs miss a piece, he finds it and 
brings it back himself. The party's wel 
fare is his concern so long as they bring 
back pieces. Given the chance, he'll kill 
the Rune Adepts. 

Waking Valmous 

Valmous the Shaper, the Adept who 
first created the awtawmatawn, sleeps in 
magical stasis in a cave behind the Col 
lege of Rune Magics (#R9 on Map 3). 
Time passes slowly for him. If the PCs 
move any awtawmatawn pieces in the two 
Colleges, his long sleep ends. He fully 
awakens in Id 10x10 minutes and begins 
hunting for intruders. 

Encountering Valmous 

Unless spotted, Valmous quietly 
sneaks up on the PCs, then sharply in 
quires why they are trespassing and med 
dling in things best left alone. In gruff 
terms, Valmous will try to convince the 
party to leave the statue pieces alone. If 
the PCs ignore him or argue, his anger 
builds slowly during the conversation un 
til he attacks the PCs-to drive them off, 
not kill them. 

Remember, Valmous looks like some 
thing that has crawled out of a crypt. Sug 
gest to the PCs that he looks undead. 

Roleplaying Rune Adepts 

The Rune Adepts who ambushed the 
party in Chapter the Vale of Volkum 
burgh dwell in the College of Rune Mag 
ics. Normally, they stay in their huts 
(#R5), but can be met as random en 
counters. 

Daver, Gerklug, Erigol and Edwood 
are incredibly ancient men. Long ago, 
they helped Valmous to destroy the aw 
tawmatawn and hide its fragments. 
Magic has kept them alive for centuries, 
but at the cost of their humanity. They 
know that intruders must be stopped, 
but the awtawmatawn is just a vague 
memory. 

The four Adepts have different person 
alities, but all are mad and have no short 
term memory (each encounter is always 
the first to them). Daver always seeks to 


11 










slay intruders and fights intelligently. 
Gerklug cackles with glee as he casts ran 
dom magic in a chaotic manner. Erigol is 
a benign healer who fights only to protect 
the neanderthals. Edwood is catatonic 
and only sits and hums, unless threat 
ened, at which time he focuses on the 
threatener and tries to kill him. Once he 
succeeds, he's catatonic again. 

Alive or dead, they will not reveal the 
specific locations of the pieces, but give 
cryptic clues like, "In tower but not" or 
"tis Valmous's pillow." 

If killed, the bodies of the Rune 
Adepts rise as wraiths in Id4xl0 minutes 
after death and continue to protect lost 
secrets (retaining their personalities). A 
risen wraith always summons 2d6 + 6 
skeletons (former comrades). 

AD&D(r) game: these wraiths Turn as 
spectres. 

Roleplaying Randomly-Encountered 
Wights 

Wights in the ruins are allied with Ly- 
chor. If they help get the pieces, Lychor 
has promised them the lives of the vil 
lagers in return. Though they keep up the 
pretense of craving the PCs' life energy, 
the undead here will seek to slay the PCs' 
foes or drive the party towards the goal, 
rather than prevent them from reaching 
it. 

Roleplaying Gargoyles 

Gargoyles don't care 'bout no stinkin' 
statues. They want food. Most attack the 
party, but at least one offers to trade in 
formation for food. If asked about giant 
statue pieces, it remembers, "a big face 
in da smoke pit, da one dat scares da 
dragon." 

Satisfied gargoyles leave the party 
alone, but untended oxen are fair game. 

Random Encounters 

Until the PCs enter either College, use 
the Volkumburgh Vale column of the 
Random Encounter Table (see Chapter 
One encounter descriptions). Check for 
encounters every three hours. 

Once the characters enter a College, 


use the column for that College. Check 
for encounters every 20 minutes. Note 
that Valmous will not be randomly en 
countered until he has awakened. 

There are plenty of places to hide in the 
ruins, so check for Surprise with each en 
counter. If an Adept is encountered, roll 
ld4 to determine who it is (assign num 
bers to them). 

The College of Rune Magics 

Two pieces of the awtawmatawn and 
the sleeping Adept, Valmous the Shaper, 
are hidden in caves here. 

This lost College of magic taught one 
of the oldest forms of magic in the For 
gotten Realms. Once a primitive, sha- 
manistic type of magic, it developed to 
become wholly dependent upon arcane 
symbols and enchanted sticks. Many 
other Colleges of Magic trace their roots 
directly to Rune Magics. Some primitive 
cultures still practice Rune Magics, but all 
Special Knowledge rituals and spells were 
lost with the College. DQ rules: 
bram of the Rime Mage (found in cave 
#R8) contains ail the spells talents and rit 
uals of the College of Rune Magics. It is 
priceless beyond value to those interested 
in practicing Rune Magic. 

Although Rune Magics are not inher 
ently evil, agents of the Forces of Light 
will attempt to destroy this book. 
AD&D(r) game: Rune magic is primitive 
when compared to "modern" magic. 
As DM, you may wish to let a PC 
magic-user use the spells in the Li- 
bram as a guide to research similar 
ones. 

Encounter Key-Map 3 

Rl. "Looks like the Temple of Selune" 


The tumbledown ruins here are 
bright blue, like the temple of the 
goddess Selune in Suzail, the floor- 
plan even seems to mimic that ancient 
temple. 


This is the destination of the Rune Por 
tal from encounter #V5 (High Pasture 


near the Village of Volkumburgh) in 
Chapter One. 

Touching the Runestick here instantly 
teleports one to the other terminus. 

R2. Rune Portal Again 

This is the destination of the Rune Por 
tal (#T2) in Chapter One (near the site of 
the Rune Adept's ambush). Touching the 
Runestick here teleports the toucher to 
the other terminus. 

If the PCs pursue the Rune Adepts 
from the ambush encounter in Chapter 
One, the ancients will be caring for their 
wyverns. A number of fresh, unwounded 
neanderthals will be guarding the area of 
the Rune Portal (one for each character 
who comes through). 

The area around the Runestick is pro 
tected by a reversed Runeward, protect 
ing those outside the warded area (dotted 
circle) from those inside it (DQ rules: 
Rune Magic ritual Q-3; AD&D(r) game: a 
combination of minor globe of invul 
nerability and protection from evil 10' 
radius permanently cast with Rune- 
sticks). 

R3. Stair to the Valley 

See Approaching the Colleges. 

R4. Ruins 

The ruined areas on the map indicate 
the locations of former buildings. Some 
walls still stand, but most is rubble. Be 
fore the Rune Adepts returned here, the 
villagers of Volkumburgh had looted 
most valuables. 

If the PCs search a ruin, make a Ran 
dom Encounter check. 

R5. Hidden Huts 


A tall stone tower stands in the mid 
dle of the College, apparently unaf 
fected by the ravages of time. In the 
window of the uppermost floor, a light 
shines. 


This illusionary, four-story-tall tower is 
based on Elminster's Tower in Shadow- 
dale (Elminster is the noted sage and 
Adept whose chronicles are the chief 


12 















source of information about the Forgot 
ten Realms). If anyone flies up to the 
fourth floor window, he or she will see the 
stationary image of a bearded old man at 
a writing desk. 

The tower disguises the crude huts of 
the four Rune Adepts. Only Edwood and 
the Adepts who survived the ambush in 
Chapter One will be here. If any were 
wounded, they will be in the midst of a 
Ritual of Healing (Rune Magic ritual Q- 
4). There are family groups of 2d4 nean 
derthals in each hut (half the number are 
children). The Rune Adepts have no trea 
sure other than Runewands and at least 
two sets of Runesticks for each of their 
known spells. 

R6. Wyvern Cave 

Wyverns who survived the ambush 
(#Tl) in Chapter One will be found here, 
along with ld3 more wyverns, and at least 
one neanderthal opponent for each PC 
(see area #R2 above). 

From the outside, an illusory cliff-face 
(Runestick illusion) hides the log palisade 
in front of the cave that keeps the wyverns 
in. The palisade is strong enough unless 
the wyverns are injured or angered by 


someone outside the cave. Human-size 
folk can pass through the gaps between 
the logs, but when a wyvern wishes to go 
through, it takes ld3 combat rounds for 
it to burst the logs asunder. The rest will 
follow. 

Rubble blocks the passage to cave #R8. 
If the PCs examine the area in the pas 
sage, they can see that something large 
and heavy, like a statue fragment, was 
dragged here, leaving deep gouges. 

It would take about ldlO + 5 hours to 
clear enough room to allow a character to 
crawl through (without magic or special 
assistance, that is). 

R7. Tower on a Pillar 


An intact tower stands alone on a 
small pillar of natural rock. A 50-foot 
gap of dizzying height separates the 
pillar from the cliff. Decayed rem 
nants of a fallen rope bridge flap in the 
breeze. 


The tower was used to isolate Adepts 
working on dangerous spells or research. 
It now guards an entrance to area #R8. 
The bridge pieces are too rotted to use. 


The door on the east side of the tower is 
magically locked (DQ rules: Runelock/ 
2; AD&D(r) game: wizard locked by an 
8th level magic-user). When the PCs 
attempt the door, make a Random En 
counter check. If successful, ld4 gar 
goyles arrive to harass and possibly kill 
members of the party (they do not fight 
to the death). 

The tower's interior is 20 feet on a side 
and 60 feet tall. In the room's center is a 
runestick set in the floor, a Rune Portal 
connecting to the cave of Lost Secrets 
#R8. 

R8. Lost Secrets 


You find a long, narrow, low- 
ceilinged natural cavern. A narrow 
tunnel exits from one end. At the 
other, you find a sealed stone box and 
what looks like the upper arm of a gi 
gantic stone man! 


The piece of arm weighs 2,000 pounds. 
The sealed stone box (magically sealed- 
see door in #R7) contains The Libram of 
Rune Magics, which has a value of 80,000 
SP/g.p. (although there are very few who 
would pay for it). For an AD&D(r) game, 
it has an X.P. value of 8,000. 

A secret door in the east wall leads to 
area #R9, Valmous's resting place. The 
demon trapped in the stone fragment im 
proves the PCs chance of finding the se 
cret door (DQ rules: 4xPerception; 
AD&D(r) game: +1 to finding chance). 

R9. Rest 'N Piece 

A long, narrow passage connects area 
#8 with this crypt. If he has not yet left his 
crypt (see Waking Valmous), Valmous 
sleeps here on a stone bier. He clutches an 
incredibly large, glass eye to his chest (big 
enough to fit, say, an awtawmatawn). 

Time has slowed in this crypt, and the 
magic begins to affect the characters im 
mediately if they do not resist its effects. 
They begin to slow down until they are 
living at half normal speed (AD&D(r) 
game: as if slowed). This effect is not 
apparent to anyone in the room (outsid 
ers can see and hear those in the chamber 





P/ ? N " x - 

iP' 

' ;v '" , 
¦ \ S, s "/// 


13 
















slow down). Time distortion makes com 
munication difficult (each message must 
be preceded by a successful dlOO roll of 
less than 35%). 

If the statue pieces in the Colleges have 
been moved, Valmous is awake and 
aware, but pretends slumber. Once 
awake, Valmous is not affected by the 
time slowing magics. 

In addition to the eye, Valmous has the 
magical items listed in his NPC descrip 
tion and a pouch containing 100 gems 
worth 100 SP/g.p. each. 

RIO. Shapers' Portal 

The ruins surround a carefully cleared 
Rune Portal. Touching the Runestick 
transports the character to the matching 
Runestick at the top of the stairs to the 
valley (#S1) in the College of Shaping 
Magics. Ancient scars in the stone reveal 
that something very heavy was dragged 
towards the Rune Portal. 

The College of Shaping Magics 

Two awtawmatawn pieces are hidden in 
areas #S5 and #Sll of this College. 

Shaping Magics did not die out when 
the College died. Enough knowledge es 
caped the College's destruction to allow 
Adepts to keep making magical items. 
But the ability and discipline to make 
truly legendary pieces was lost. Rediscov 
ery of the College's secrets reopens this 
area of reseatch. Should Valmous survive 
the adventure's end, he will seek to re 
build the College. 

DQ rules: The Tome of Shaping Se 
crets contains all the spells, talents and 
rituals of the College of Shaping Magics. 
Its value cannot be measured in game 
terms. With this book, a character could 
reestablish the College. 

AD&D(r) game: The Tome of Shaping 
Secrets contains spells that aid in cre 
ating magical items, including the fol 
lowing: contact other plane, stone 
shape, enchant an item, guards and 
wards, limited wish, truename, bind 
ing, permanency, and temporal stasis. 
The book also contains secrets that 
improve the saving throw vs. magic of 


an item being enchanted by 2 points 
(that is 2 points better than the magic- 
user performing the enchantment). 

Encounter Key-Map 4 

51. A Long Climb 

This is the top of the stair to the valley 
(see Approaching the Colleges). 

The Rune Stick set in the pavement 
near the north end of the landing here is 
the matched pair to the Runestick in area 
#R10 in the College of Rune Magics. 
Touching this Runestick transports the 
character to area #R10. 

52. Flying Box 


A 10-foot-square, 12-foot-tall brass 
and glass box stands with its two doors 
open. 

The box is a brass and glass flying ele 
vator. Unless fiddled with, it transports 
its occupants from area #Sl to the west 
edge of area #S3. 

The elevator has been enchanted into 
sentience, talks in a hollow, brassy voice 
and has a cranky personality. It will not 
tell how to use itself and is deathly afraid 
of heights. 

Inside is a control panel with two 
arrow-shaped buttons, a red one pointing 
up and a blue one pointing down. Next 
to the buttons is a small circular opening 
with screw threads inside. Pressing the 
red button causes the box to rise up to 
area #S3. Press the blue button and it de 
scends to area #1. If the control panel is 
searched, a secret compartment is found. 
Inside the compartment is a brass stick 
with screw threads at one end. If the stick 
is screwed into the hole, it becomes a 
"joystick" that allows the user to fly the 
box (using the buttons for altitude). The 
box can carry up to 3,000 pounds. The 
box's air speed is as follows: DQ rules: 
Flying 400; AD&D(r) game: MV 15", 
Manueverability class C. The box must 
be coerced to fly higher than 20 feet and 
cannot sustain flight for more than one 
hour before it automatically descends to 
earth for ld3 hours to "recharge its fraz 


zled nerves." 

The box affords protection equal to 
chain mail armor and can sustain 40 
points of damage before being destroyed. 

S3. Creepy Chasm 


The path across this small plateau 
leads through a deep chasm. 

The natural rock walls flanking the 
path are 50 feet tall. The path is unnatu 
rally dark and torches are needed once the 
party enters the misty area. The misty 
area is enchanted. Distance is magically 
distorted here with true distances being 
hidden by the mist. Instead of being an 
80-foot-long path, it's 2,000 feet long. 
Once the party enters the darkness, it 
must travel 2,000 feet in any direction to 
reach the other side. 

S4. Floating Shields 

The way across the chasm to the Col 
lege is perilous. The bridge is made of 
floating shields. A total of 15, 4-foot- 
diameter shields spans the gap, with 
about 2 feet of space between each shield. 
The shields "give" when weight is placed 
upon them. The first time the lead char 
acter steps on a shield, have him make a 
Dexterity check (DQ rules: 4xAgility; 
AD&D(r) game: Dexterity Ability 
Check). Failure means the character 
doesn't expect the give. Allow a second 
Dexterity check to give the character a 
chance to gain a hold-otherwise he or 
she falls (DQ rules: 4xManual Dexter- 
ity)- 

When one or more party members are 
across or on the bridge make a Random 
Encounter check. If it is successful, ld4 
gargoyles take the opportunity to harass 
and possibly kill members of the party 
(they do not fight to the death). Charac 
ters who fight on the shield bridge must 
make Dexterity Checks each round that 
they fight on the bridge (DQ rules: if 
the character's roll exceeds 4.5xAgility, 
the character falls; AD&D(r) game: If the 
character rolls a 20, the character 
falls). 


14 















55. Pillbox on a Pillar 

The outside of this tower is very similar 
to area #R7 in the College of Rune Mag 
ics, but is only 15 feet tall. The gap from 
area #S3 is 25 feet and it is 40 feet from 
the main College. The floor of the tower 
is an illusion that hides a 30-foot-deep 
pit. Falling into the pit does (DQ rules) 
9 points of damage to Endurance or 
(AD&D(r) game rules) 6d6 hit points of 
damage . At the bottom is the lower sec 
tion of the awtawmatawn's leg (minus 
the foot) which weighs 1,000 pounds. 

56. Gatehouse 

This is an intact, castle-like structure 
with a 20-foot-wide, 10-foot-tall oaken 
double door. The door is magically 
locked (DQ rules: Runelocked at Rank 
2; AD&D(r) game: wizard locked by an 
8th level magic- user). 

There is not room enough here to force 
the massive doors (although they can be 
opened easily from inside the gatehouse). 
PCs may wish to climb over it or around 
it. The crevices of the wall are lair to an 
endless supply of black widow spiders. 
Each time a character reaches for a hand 
hold, he has a 25% chance of putting a 
hand into a spider nest (AD&D(r) game: 
Black widow spider attacks a bare 
hand as a 5 HD monster. Saving throw 
is at +4. Failure means taking 3 
points of damage per round for 1D10 
rounds). 

The gatehouse's intact interior has 
been looted. Exploring the gatehouse 
means a 40% chance to encounter 
ld6 + 1 wights and Id 10 zombies. 

57. Ruins 

The ruined areas on the map indicate 
the locations of former buildings. Some 
walls still stand, but most are rubble. 
Volkumburgh villagers have looted most 
valuables. 

If the characters search a ruin, make a 
Random Encounter check (Check for sur 
prise). 

58. Intact Tower 

This tower is two stories tall. If the 
characters do any more than just pass 
through it, they arouse ld6 + 4 zombies 


and two wights. 

The door in the cliff wall southeast of 
the tower is a slab of stone mortared in 
place. A Runestick embedded in the slab 
creates the illusion of cliff wall. 

S9. Quarry of the Awtawmatawn 

The ruins of Valmous's shaping shop 
surround the cliff-face from which the 
awtawmatawn was carved. Stone chips 
form a pile around the base of the 40- 
foot-high carved-out area. If the area is 
searched, a magical bronze carving knife 
will be found stuck into the cliff face. 
This tool affects flesh or metal like a nor 
mal dagger, but cuts stone like it was 
warm butter (i.e., it attacks stone as if it 
were unarmored flesh and does damage 
like a two-handed sword). 

S10. An Illusion of Doom 

Read the following when the party 
opens the door at the base of the stairs. 


The door opens onto a circular room 
with seven other identical doors 
spaced evenly about it. 

The circular room is enchanted with a 
complicated illusion. None of the doors 
will open until any open door is closed. 
When a door closes, it magically locks 
(DQ rules: Runelock/7; AD&D(r) 
game: Wizard locked by M-U 12) and 
the room appears to spin for two minutes. 
The illusion causes PCs to think that they 
are being thrown against the walls along 
with any sand in the room (see below). 
PCs may move, but each attempt requires 
a Strength Check (DQ rules: 4xPhysical 
Strength). Each time a door is opened or 
tried, the room appears to fill with a foot 
of sand that pours in from the 10-foot- 
high ceiling. For each foot of sand the 
door opening becomes harder (DQ 
rules, increase difficulty factor by .5 (ini 
tial value of 3.5 becomes 3, then 2.5, and 
so on down to .5; AD&D(r) game: Re 
duce door opening chance by 1 each 
time). Careful study will show which of 
the eight doors has had the most use 
(DQ rules: 2xPerception; AD&D(r) 
game: Intelligence Check at -5). 


511. Shining Shard 

This chamber contains the highly pol 
ished missing fragment of the awtawma 
tawn's upper leg. Touching the fragment 
releases a basilisk that was enchanted into 
it as a guardian. The piece of stone leg 
weighs 1,500 pounds. A Runestick for a 
Rune Portal is set in the floor. It connects 
to a matching Runestick in the pass on 
Mount Drakkor Rouge (Chapter Three, 
encounter #2). If the PCs search the 
room, they will note extremely deep drag 
scars leading toward the Runestick. 

512. Repository of Failed Magics 

The Shapers stored their failures here, 
items that were complete, but somehow 
did not work as planned. A few magical 
items are suggested; you may wish to cre 
ate others. Have fun with them. 

Invisible magic sword (DQ rules: 
Rank 2 with broad sword; AD&D(r) game: 
broad sword + 1). Looks like an empty 
scabbard. 

Enchanted leather armor. Protects like 
chain mail but weighs as much as a suit of 
plate mail. 

Zcebirfs Disk: When the command 
word "Zing" is spoken, the disk becomes 
a 3-foot-diameter glowing concave disk 
that floats 3 feet off the ground (AD&D(r) 
game: Tenser's floating disk), capable 
of supporting 1,500 pounds. Speaking 
the command "Taykrupp" makes it to 
rise up. "Droppr" makes it descend until 
it is within 3 feet of the ground again. 
Flaws: It has no maximum height and 
rises until commanded to drop. It cannot 
hover at any height above 3 feet. Unless 
consciously controlled, the disc will wan 
der away (at walking speed).

Encounter Setting 

The encounters in this chapter take place 
on Mount Drakkor Rouge, a flooded, 
semi-extinct volcano in the southern 
Thunder Peaks range, the site of the Tem 
ple of the Dragon Oracle and home to 
Flashfire, a recently arrived red dragon 
(refer to maps 5 and 6). 

Unless the party vowed to slay the 
dragon, the PCs have probably obtained 
all but the awtawmatawn's head by the 
time they come here. Lychor the Evil 
Adept, Valmous, the awatawmatawn's 
creator, and mean little Erek will be here 
to aid or confound the party (see En 
counter Setting in Chapter Two). 

Although one Rune Portal found in 
the Shaper's College leads here, it is just 
as likely that the party will travel here 
overland through the mountains with 
their ox-drawn wagon. 

The Rune Portal found near one of the 
statue pieces (area #S11) in the Shapers' 
College leads to the rim of a crater in the 
side of Mount Drakkor Rouge (see Map 
5). A salt marsh fills the crater and sur 
rounds a rocky island. 

The plume of dark vapor rising from 
the island marks the location of the aban 
doned temple of the Dragon Oracle. 
Once the abode of sinister witches who 
fortold the future, it is now home to 
Flashfire, a red dragon who came south in 
the dragon invasion. It is here that the 
awtawmatawn's head can be found. 

Flashfire, mature red dragon: 

DQ rules 

Spells: Ail talents, spells, and rituals of 
the College of Sorceries of the Mind at 
Rank 17. Upon death, he may curse his 
treasure. 

Flashfire, Adult Red Dragon: 
AD&D(r)game 
Spell Book 

Level 1: Charm person, sleep 
Level 2: Detect invisible, invisibility 
Level 3: Lightning bolt 

Flashfire makes saving throws as a 
13th level monster (saving throws for 
dragons in the Forgotten Realms are 
determined by dividing their hit points 
by 4). 


Notes: Flashfire came south several years 
ago in the dragon invasion that destroyed 
the city of Phlan on the shores of the 
Moonsea. Drawn by a vague compulsion, 
he continued south until he reached 
Mount Drakkor Rouge and its Dragon 
Cult temple. He suspects that the temple 
exerts some kind of control over him, pre 
venting him from leaving. The statues in 
the dragon plaza prevent him from de 
parting the area of the Thunder Peaks or 
lairing elsewhere. 

Flashfire is vain, clever, curious, and 
subject to mood shifts (flattery can be 
used against him). The dragon is afraid of 
the fumarole pit and will not go down 
into it (he senses the dragonwight in area 
#17 of Map 6). 

If aware of intruders, he will be invisi 
ble. In his first attack he uses dragon fear 
and demands to know why he shouldn't 
destroy the intruders where they stand. 
Unless bribed with much treasure, he at 
tacks. Flashfire will not fight to the 
death. 

Roleplaying the Dragon 

Flashfire is fine example of mature, 
adult red dragonhood. He is self- cen 
tered, greedy and evil. He often makes 
arbitrary decisions. He is not stupid. He 
likes games, especially cat-and-mouse 
games (he always gets to play the cat). 

However, the dragon also has prob 
lems. Something in the smoke pit fright 
ens him nearly senseless, an emotion he is 
not used to (it's the dragonwight, a form 
of undead dragon). He would like to fly 
away forever and leave this undragonish 
emotion far behind, but something 
causes him to keep returning here (see the 
description for the Plaza of Dragons, area 
# 8 ). 

He will recognize that the PCs are not 
simple shepherds and may decide to use 
them for his own purposes. At the DM's 
discretion, this mighty dragon may bar 
gain with the party. Free him and the 
party can have what they came for and 
stay alive (so long as his mood holds). 

If the PCs offer him something in re 
turn for not killing them (like the red 
gems they may have been collecting), 
Flashfire might help them get the statue 


head out of the pit (area #17 of Map 6), 
once they deal with the pit's resident. It 
would not be out of character for Flashfire 
to help the party retrieve the stone head 
and then attack them later as they try to 
haul it away. 

Base Flashfire's actions on the history 
of the party so far. If everything has gone 
their way, Flashfire bargains and then be 
trays them. Make sure he attacks when 
they are in an awkward position. 

If the party has taken casualties and is 
barely alive, Flashfire might unaccount 
ably decide to live up to his bargain. 

Roleplaying Gargoyles 

The gargoyles have lived here much 
longer than the dragon. They serve him 
out of fear, not loyalty. To their minds, 
things were better before the dragon 
came, although they look to him for pro 
tection. 

The gargoyles do not fight to the 
death, they try to escape if in danger of 
dying. Gargoyles who escape encounters 
will warn the other gargoyles in the com 
plex. They will warn the dragon only if 
they are in danger of being wiped out as a 
group. A captured gargoyle will bargain 
for its life, even betraying the dragon. If 
questioned about a giant head, it remem 
bers seeing one "in da smoke pit, da one 
dat scares da dragon." 

Random Encounters 

Flying characters will avoid all but fly 
ing encounters (marked by an "F") and 
weather. "W" encounters can only occur 
in the water. "L" encounters occur only 
on land, the intact portions of the ancient 
bridge or in the temple. Do not reroll en 
counters that cannot occur due to terrain 
incompatibility. 

On the trail up, in the pass, and on the 
trail down, make Encounter Checks every 
20 minutes. In the marsh and on the is 
land, make checks every 10 minutes. 

Encounters with unintelligent crea 
tures occur because the monster is hungry 
or defending its territory. Only the 
swamp-shark will fight to the death. 
Every other creature flees to a lair if 


16 











wounded more than 50%. 

If Lychor is encountered, he is invisi 
ble, spying on the PCs. He will help them 
against the dragon or Valmous, but will 
use the confusion of battle to remain hid 
den and disguise his aid. 

If Valmous is encountered, he con 
fronts the party. He will not let them 
bring the head to Volkumburgh. Should 
Valmous overpower the PCs, bring Ly 
chor to their aid to drive off the Shaper. 

Encounter Key 

Encounter areas #1 through #7 use DM 
map 6-Mount Drakkor Rouge. 

1. The Trail Up 

If the party has promised to slay the 
dragon for the villagers, peasant guides 
will take them and their wagons to the 
base of Mount Drakkor Rouge. The jour 
ney takes about three days. 

At the mountain base a guide points 
up the trail to a dark plume of smoke. 

"There be the dragon," he will say. 

The villagers then express their thanks, 
wish the blessings of the gods on the party 
and hastily depart. 

The trail up the mountain is rugged 
terrain and overgrown, but no more diffi 
cult than the rest of the journey here. It is 
possible to get the wagon up the trail, but 
only if the party assists the oxen. If the 
trail is studied, evidence of passage by 
livestock (sheep) is visible. 

2. Impasse 


The trail has reached its highest 
point; below you is a roughly circular 
valley, possibly a crater whose bottom 
is obscured by mist. Barely rising from 
the center of the valley is a low but 
sharply triangular rocky prominence. 
A dark plume of smoke rises from that 
rock. 

The way down is through a steep- 
walled pass-which is blocked by 
boulders. While it is possible for you 
to climb over or walk around the de 


bris, wagons will not move through 
here without several hours of work to 
clear the rubble away. 

It will take ld3 hours to clear the rub 
ble away (see inset Map 5 a). Have each 
character make a check to avoid injury 
while rolling boulders (DQ rules; 
4xAgility toll; AD&D(r) game: Dexterity 
Ability Check). Failure means the char 
acter takes ld6 points of damage. 

Five gargoyles are hidden in the rub 
ble, just off the main path. They will be 
found only by characters looking for 
something unusual. 

If characters look for gargoyles and fail 
(DQ rules: 2xPerception; AD&D(r) 
game: a roll of 1 on a d6 - DM makes 
all rolls), let them find rocks that look like 
gargoyles, just to satisfy their suspicions. 

The gargoyles wait to attack until the 
party is occupied with moving the boul 
ders or moving through them. One gar 
goyle always flies off to warn the dragon 
while the other four attack. If discovered, 


they attack immediately. If undiscovered, 
they attack with surprise. 

A gargoyle only fights until 50% 
wounded, then flees to the temple. 

If Flashfire the dragon is warned, he ar 
rives to investigate in ld6 +4 turns. 

3. The Trail Down 

The trail down is similar to the trail up, 
but when the party passes "x" on the 
trail, vision is reduced to 15 feet by the 
warm mist rising from the salt marsh un 
til they reach the point marked "c" on 
the trail. When the PCs reach this point, 
read the following: 


The mist parts to reveal a rancid, 
scum-covered lake filling a crater-like 
depression in the mountainside and 
surrounding a large, rocky central is 
land that rises up like a small moun 
tain itself. The streamer of vapor seen 
earlier rises up from the island's small 
peak. 


17 


















From here, through the mist, you 
can just barely see the remnants of 
mankind's handiwork-a rotting 
bridge that spans the lake and a tem 
ple near the island's summit. 


Below the mist, the temperature is 
warmer (about 70 degrees Fahrenheit). 

The last 2,000 feet of trail (5 hexes) are 
along a high cliff overlooking the salt 
marsh. It is a challenging climb from the 
trail down to the water's edge. The trail 
stops at the end of a rickety, collapsed 
wooden bridge that once spanned the 
marsh. 

4. Broken Bridge 


A 20-foot-wide wooden causeway 
extends out into the stinking lake. 
About 600 feet out, it sinks beneath 
the surface of the scummy water, rising 
again 500 feet later. 


It is possible to drive the wagon all the 
way across the bridge, even the covered 
parts. The water never rises higher than 
two-and-a-half feet. However, the under 
water portion of the bridge is also the lair 
of giant leeches. If a No Encounter result 
occurs while crossing the bridge, roll 
ldlO. On a roll of 6-10, ld6 + 2 giant 
leeches attack the party. Note: There is 
only a 1 % chance of detecting a leech at 
tack while in the water. 

5. Dragon Marsh 

Water seeping down the mountain side 
fills the marsh, but the brackish salt 
marsh drains only by evaporation. Geo 
thermal activity keeps the water at about 
85 degrees Fahrenheit and the air above 
at 70 degrees. Most of the creatures in and 
around the marsh are not native (and 
some, like the gargoyles and swamp 
sharks, not natural). They were stocked 
here long ago to protect the temple. 

The water in the marsh is at most, 
about 50 feet deep. The shores of the is 
land are shallow-lined with reeds and 
cypress-like trees (large, above- water root 
clusters) while the outer shores are steep 


and cliff-like. 

Warning: Warm blood spilled in the 
marsh ALWAYS attracts ld6 swamp 
sharks (see below) and ld4 giant leeches 
in Id 10 rounds. 

Swamp sharks are magically modified 
sharks, adapted to fit this salt lake envi 
ronment. For both AD&D(r) game and 
DQ rules, use the largest size of normal 
shark. They are colored dirty gray with 
greenish-black markings that look like 
patches of scum. Unlike natural sharks, a 
swamp shark's fins are adapted for crawl 
ing and it can leave the water for short 
periods of time (breathing through prim 
itive lungs). A swamp shark will never be 
encountered on the land, but it will pur 
sue a victim onto land until blocked by an 
obstacle (the swamp shark cannot climb). 
Movement speed for a beached swamp 
shark is: DQ rules: Running: 150 
(TMR: 3); AD&D(r) game: 3". 

6. Temple Trail 

The path from bridge to temple is 
paved, yet dangerous. The island's vol 
canic rock slashes shoe leather to ribbons 
within one hex of travel and does ld3 
points of damage/ten minutes of travel 
to unprotected feet. 

7. The Temple of the Dragon Oracle 

Three centuries ago the Cult of 

Dragons openly had a temple here. Al 
though this temple is abandoned and its 
original inhabitants long gone, the evil 
cult that created it supposedly still exists. 
The Cult of Dragons is believed to be a 
mysterious group of Adepts who have de 
vised strange magical arts that give them 
mastery over evil dragonkind. This tem 
ple was once part of their master plan to 
rule the world. The witches who dwelt 
here long ago believed that the sulphu 
rous vapors from the pit in the caverns 
would inspire them to prophesy the fu 
ture. Even before the creation of the aw- 
tawmatawn, this place was deserted. 

For whatever the reason, the cult aban 
doned the temple, but left intact magics 
that have acted as a beacon to dragons. 
These are the magics that have drawn 
Flashfire to the temple. 

The temple is built upon a series of 


large, connected lava caves. Originally, 
the only access to the caves was the vent 
above the fumarole (area #13). The cult- 
ists carved out the other rooms as resi 
dences and created the plaza as part of 
their summoning device. 

Now, Flashfire lairs in the back of the 
cave (areas #15 and #16) and uses the 
vent as his chief means of entrance and 
exit. He can also walk down the stairs con 
necting the fumarole and the plaza (areas 
#8 and #12). 

The dragon cannot pass more than his 
head through passage entrances marked 
with an "x." 

The gargoyles encountered in the area 
dwell here in the temple. There are three 
distinct groups-found in areas #11, #9- 
10 and #13. Except for their own col 
lected possessions, they have thoroughly 
trashed these areas. 

Encounter areas #8 through #16 use 
Map 6-Temple of the Dragon Oracle. 

8. Plaza of Dragons 


The road ascends steeply to a plaza 
filled with marvelously crafted and 
brightly-colored dragon sculptures, 
standing on ornate stone pedestals. 
The four primary types of evil dragons 
are represented here-red, blue, 
green, and black. Each statue is about 
20 feet long and 10 feet high and 
seems untouched by time. Beyond the 
statues is a heavily carved wall. Stone 
pilasters (half pillars) frame intricate, 
but weathered carvings of dragons in 
service to mankind. In the center of 
the wall, a 30-foot-wide archway leads 
into the island. Even from here, you 
can smell a hint of brimstone. 


The stone of each statue is the color of 
the dragon it represents. Together, the 
four dragon statues are part of the 
Dragon Cult's "dragon beacon." The 
beacon drew Flashfire here. Flashfire un 
consciously avoids the plaza, but if he 
walks or lands between the four dragon 
sculptures, he must make a resistance 
check against the statues' magic (DQ 


18 

















rules: 3xMagical Aptitude; AD&D(r) 
game: saving throw vs. spells) or be 
come instantly subdued to the will of the 
nearest human. The effect lasts for 3d4 
hours unless renewed or extended by 
other magics. 

Each statue has an art value of 5,000 
SP/g.p. and weighs about three tons. 
Destroying any statue or removing it 
from its pedestal ends the control that the 
dragon plaza has over Flashfire. 

A hidden trail leads off from the east 
ern edge of the plaza. Characters who 
search (as if looking for secret doors) will 
find it. The trail connects with a crack 
like tunnel in the cliff face, which in turn 
connects with a secret stair (see area #10). 

9. Priests' Quarters 


Your light barely illuminates this 
great, high-ceilinged hall. Flaking, 
mold-covered wall paintings depict 
red, blue, yellow, green and white 
dragons soaring into the sky. Debris is 
everywhere, but several large piles fill 
the corners and line the walls. The 
stench of long occupancy is strong 
here. 


Once the living and working quarters 
of the temple's lesser priestesses, all that 
remains here is trash. The ceiling is 60 
feet high. If the party's lights reach that 
high, they will see the upper walls and 
ceiling are riddled with niches just big 
enough to hide or protect a gargoyle. The 
five debris piles marked on the map are 
gargoyle nests. The room is the lair of 
eight gargoyles. Regardless of the time of 
day it is entered, there will be ld6 gar 
goyles present (plus any gargoyles 
wounded by previous encounters). 

If combat with the gargoyles occurs in 
this room, the monsters make full use of 
the high ceiling for aerial attacks, bom 
bardment with rocks (2d6 damage) and 
swoops (similar to the dragon attack, but 
requires two gargoyles to pull off). 

Each gargoyle nest contains the follow 
ing: ld6x 1,000 copper farthings/ cp; 
ld20xl0SP/-; ldlOxlOOSP/g.p.; ldlO 
gems worth 100 SP/g.p. each and ld2 


finely crafted pieces of jewelry worth 
Idl0x20 SP/g.p. each. In addition, one 
of the piles contains a ring of fire resist 
ance (AD&D(r) game) which gives a DQ 
rules character the effects of both the 
Spell of Fireproofing (G-7 at Rank 6) and 
the Spell of Protection Against Magical 
Fire (G-8 at Rank 5) from the College of 
Fire Magics. 

A secret door in the east wall opens 
upon a stairway that descends to connect 
this area to area #16 (inner dragon's lair) 
and a path leading outside to the plaza 
(area #8). 

10-11. Oracle's Quarters 


The stink of gargoyles is strong here, 
even masking the scent of dragon. 
Filth is everywhere. 

These were the high priestess's quar 
ters. Like area #9, they are now gargoyle 
lairs. The inner (#11) and outer (#10) 
rooms each contain ld3 gargoyles. The 
inner room also contains a dead gargoyle 
and a sheep carcass. A secret door con 
nects to area #14. 

The two nests in this area each contain 
treasure similar to the nests in area #9. 
The nest in the inner chamber (#11) con 
tains a special treasure, left from the time 
of the Dragon Cult. It is a book bound in 
the skin of a blue dragon and inscribed in 
gold runes. If the PCs have the ability to 
read dead languages, they can glean the 
following: 

The temple was created by the Dragon 
Cult. The Dragon Cult seeks to control 
evil dragons. The Dragon Cult seeks to 
control the world with undead dragons. 
Finally, it tells of the functioning of the 
"dragon beacon" in the dragon plaza 
(area #8) and states that "dragons within 
its confines become subdued." 

The book contains two spells that force 
dragons to do the bidding of the spell 
caster. 

DQ rules: Ritual of Binding Will of 
Dragon and Ritual of Binding Will of 
Red Dragon. These rituals function like 
the Ritual of Binding Will (Q-l) of the 
College of Sorceries of the Mind, but af 


fect only dragons (or specific dragons). 
Unlike other magical spells, these spells 
may be used by an Adept of any College. 
The red dragon spell reduces the target's 
resistance by 20. 

AD&D(r) game: Charm red dragon, 
and charm dragon. Each of these 
spells is 3rd level and functions ex 
actly like the 4th level spell charm 
monster. The red dragon spell penal 
izes the saving throw of a red dragon 
by 3 points. The general spell is cast 
at normal chances. 

Although it appears beneficial to own 
this tome, opening it has magically at 
tracted the attention of the Dragon Cult. 
This "attention" is outside the scope of 
this module, but you as DM may wish to 
have mysterious forces begin to dog the 
party's trail. 

12. The Cavern of the Oracle 


Acrid smoke billows upwards from 
the floor, exiting this huge cavern 
through a trapezoidal opening in the 
ceiling. The area around the opening 
in the floor is tiled in such a way as to 
remind you of dragon hide. 


It is here that the Dragon Cult witches 
practiced their craft. The cavern is big 
enough to allow a dragon to do a wing- 
assisted hop. To reach the hidden terrace 
(#14), the dragon's cave (#15), and asso 
ciated tunnels, the PCs must climb a 15- 
foot cliff (although the cliff at "A" is a 
gentle slope with steps carved in like a 
stair). The volcanic smoke is very hot and 
smells bad, but is not poisonous. 

13. Fumarole 

The pit here is a volcanic vent. Some 
where, deep below, it connects with live 
lava (but that does not concern this ad 
venture). About 50 feet down is what the 
PCs are looking for. If a PC looks into the 
pit, read the following: 


The acrid smoke stings your eyes, 
but far below, you can see what looks 
like a huge face, lit by a red glow. 


19 


















Although the smoke makes climbing the 
40-foot-deep shaft difficult (DQ rules: 
2xManual Dexterity for non-thieves, - 
30% for thieves; AD&D(r) game: - 
20 %), a carefully-roped person could 
climb down into the lava pit (area #17) 
where the awtawmatawn's head is lo 
cated. Damage inflicted if a character 
falls: (DQ rules: 8 EN points; AD&D(r) 
game: 4d6 damage). 

14. Hidden Terrace 


Like a balcony in a cathedral, this el 
evated terrace is filled with stone 
benches that look out through stone 
arches upon a great hall. 


From this ledge, it is a 15-foot-drop to 
area #12, although the cliff at point "A" 
slopes gently and has steps carved into it, 
like a stair. The dragon cannot reach char 
acters who cling to the ledge's west wall 
with its head or claws. Boulders hide the 
secret door at the south end of the terrace. 

15. Outer Chamber 


This large side cavern is filled with 
debris, rubble, and animal bones. 
Much of the rubble is snapped-off 
stalagmites and stalactites, many as 
large as temple columns. 


To reach area #12, the PCs must climb 
down 15 feet. To reach the inner cave 
(area #16), they must climb up 10 feet. 
There is plenty of room here for the 
dragon to manuever and fight (but not 
fly or hop). 


16. Inner Sanctum 


Although the entire complex stinks 
of dragon, nowhere is it stronger than 
in here. The glint of gold draws your 
attention to small piles of coins along 
the walls, nestled in between what can 
only be heaps of gargantuan, rusty, 
iron chain. 


This is Flashfire's lair. If the party has 
been undetected before reaching this 
point, Flashfire will be asleep here, so 
add the following: 


Of course, the dragon in here may 
object to your meddling with its trea 
sure. 


The chains are connected to the cave 
walls and end in dragon-sized manacles. 
To move the chains, a character must roll 
less than his Strength score on percentile 
dice. They are strong enough to restrain a 
dragon. The manacles lock when closed. 
There is no key. 

If the party expects a huge treasure, 
they will be disappointed. Flashfire has 
had little opportunity to acquire loot: 
500 farthings/cp, 1,000 SP/-, 2,000 
SP/g.p., a gemmed golden tore worth 
1,000 SP/g.p.. 


17. Dragonwight! 


The heat here is oppressive; but at 
last, you stand before the head of the 
mighty awtawmatawn-though you 
must admit you didn't expect it to be 
quite so fierce looking. Of course, you 
are even more surprised to feel a chill 
and see the eerie, rotted, dragonish 
thing crawling up out of the crack be 
hind it. 


The walls here are hot; they do 1 point 
of damage each time unprotected flesh 
touches them. The awtawmatawn head is 
about 5 feet tall and 4 feet wide and 
grimaces evilly. The "eerie dragonish 
thing" is a dragonwight, a form of un 
dead dragon left over from Dragon Cult 
experiments (see New Monsters section). 
The dragonwight senses life energy and 
attacks, but cannot leave the pit. 

Near the edge of the pit is a large stone 
box (also hidden here by Valmous). The 
sealed stone box (magically sealed-see 
the door in #R7 in the College of Rune 
Magics) contains the Tome of Shaping Se 
crets (see introduction to this College). It 
has a rough value of 100,000 SP/g.p.. 
For an AD&D(r) game, it has an X.P. 
value of 8,000. 

Getting the Head Out 

The head weighs 4,000 lbs and is miss 
ing one of its glass eyes (see Chapter Two, 
Valmous's resting place. #R9). The PCs 
must figure out how to get the head up 
and out. Amelior's brass bottles would be 
the easiest way. Block and tackle or a 
"helpful" dragon will also do the trick.

The Weather 

In the Forgotten Realms, the month of 
Uktar (November) heralds the coming of 
winter. In the high reaches of the moun 
tains, it is already cold and snowy. Each day 
of the adventure, the DM should check the 
day's weather. The weather can affect the 
rate of progress, the discomfort level of the 
group and possibly cause physical damage. 
Combine the rolls of ld8 and Id 12 to ob 
tain the day's weather. Apply the results to 
the day's activity.

dawn, the second at noon and the op 
tional third after dark. 

** Roll again until two different weather 
patterns are obtained. These two pat 
tern will alternate every 2d6 turns. 

Temperature: Warm means 60+ degrees 
Fahrenheit (snow melts at a half inch an 
hour and turns to slush, streams swell with 
run-off); cool is 40-59 degrees Fahenheit; 
cold is 25-39 degrees; very cold is 0-24 de 
grees; extreme cold is -10-0 degrees and a 
cold snap drops to -11 and below. Wind 
chill is considered in all cases. 

Unprotected characters take one point 
of damage per hour for each 10 degrees be 
low 40. Warmly dressed characters take 1 
point of damage each two hours when the 
temperature is very cold\ ld2 pointsof 
damage each two hours during extreme 
cold and ld3 points each two hours during 
a cold snap. If characters are unsheltered 


and inactive, damage occurs at twice the 
above rate. 

Precipitation: rain is simple rainfall; freez 
ing rain ices up wagons, roads, trees and 
gear; sleet is frozen rain (reduces visibility 
to 1,000 feet); heavy snow accumulates at 
2d6" per day (reduces visibility to 100 
feet); a blizzard literally drops 3d4" per 
hour, and blinds the party (nothing visible 
beyond 5 feet). An ice storm drenches eve 
rything in freezing rain and sleet (visiblity 
as heavy'snow). 

Blizzards and ice storms are always ac 
companied by very cold temperature. 
Snow reduces movement speeds by 1" per 
4 inches of snow.

NEW MONSTER: 

The Awtawmatawn 

Except where noted, the giant size of the go 
lem does not increase the range or effect of its 
magical abilities. 

If the PCs did not obtain the awtawmatawn's 
glass eye (from Valmous's resting place, area #R9 
in the College of Rune Magics, Map 3), it will be 
blind on its left side and have reduced combat 
abilities. Attacks against the golem's blind side 
gain a bonus (DQ rules: + 10; AD&D(r) game: 
+ 2). The golem's return attacks are all at re 
duced skill (DQ rules; -5; AD&D(r) game: - 
1 ).

Because of its size, the awtawmatawn moves 
more slowly than the characters and may attack 
foes less than half its size twice every three pulses. 
It may attack larger foes and buildings once per 
pulse. Only magical weapons can harm stone go 
lems and any weapon that strikes a stone golem 
must be checked for breakage per normal break 
age chance. Only magic that affects stone can 
have any effect on the awtawmatawn. 

Weapons: the awtawmatawn can pick up and use 
anything big enough to be a weapon (a 10-foot- 
long log would become a club), but has no Rank 
with the weapon. It may attack with its hands in 
Melee Combat with a Base Chance of 40% of do 
ing 2D10 +10 damage. 

Comments: Because of the occupation by Rot- 
bite, it remains animated until the Special 
Knowledge Counterspell of Shaping Magics is 
cast over it, or until its Endurance is exhausted.

to hit; immune to physically-damaging spells 
other than rock to mud (which slows the mon 
ster 50% for 2d6 melee rounds, while mud to 
rock repairs all damage suffered by the go 
lem), and stone to flesh makes the golem vul 
nerable to normal attacks on the next round 
(Note: a single use of this spell will affect 
1d6 + 2 of the monster's Hit Dice.) 

Because of its size, the awtawmatawn 
moves more slowly than the characters and 
may attack foes less than half its size twice 
every three rounds. It may attack larger foes 
and buildings once per round. 

From Rotbite the horned devil, the awtawma 
tawn gains the ability to exude fear in a 30' ra 
dius (normal radius of 5' enhanced by its 
size-saving throw vs. wands applies); once 
per turn or melee round as applicable: charm 
person, suggestion, infravision, know align 
ment, animate dead, pyrotechnics, produce 
flame, ESP, detect magic, and illusion. Once 
per day, it can create a wall of fire of triple nor 
mal strength with regard to damage caused 
(3d8). 

Rotbite's natural Magic Resistance is ap 
plied to all magical spells that can physically 
affect the golem's stone body or mentally af

In his current form, the horned devil Rot 
bite cannot summon others of his kind. 

Giant Leech (DQ rules only) 

Natural Habitat: Swamps & Marshes 
Ftequency: Common 
Number: 1-10 (5) 

Description: A large, rubbery creature related to 
the snail and slug. It is a threat to any warm 
blooded creature within 30 feet. Like the com 
mon leech it sucks the blood of its victims. 
However, this monster can grow up to two feet 
long.

Weapons: Leeches attack by attaching themselves 
to submerged parts of the victim's body (a Base 
Chance of 50%). On all subsequent pulses, the 
Leech drains D10-7 (never less than 1) Damage, 
first from Fatigue and then from Endurance. 
Comments: A victim has only a 1 % chance to de 
tect an attack while submerged. After losing all 
Fatigue Points, the victim will become aware that 
something is amiss. Attacks or a quantity of salt 
will kill a giant leech. 


Swamp Shark (DQ & AD&D(r) rules) 

See Encounter #5 in Chapter Three for this crea 
ture's description. 

Dragonwight (DQ & AD&D(r) rules) 

The dragonwight is a discarded nightmare cre 
ated by the sorcerous experiments of the out 
lawed Dragon Cult. It looks like a spectral, 
not-quite-solid, decaying dragon corpse. It's 
color and other appearance features depend on 
the type of dragon that it was in life. Right now, 
the dragonwight in the Temple of the Dragon 
Oracle is a unique creature. 

A dragonwight is a form of undead dragon. It 
combines the physical attributes of the dragon 
that it was in life with the life-draining and non- 
magical weapon immunity abilities of the un 
dead wight. The dragonwight cannot fly (its 
decayed wings will not support it) and cannot use 
its breath weapon nor any spells known in life. 

It still can use dragon fear, but not the rapid- 
fire attacks of the Forgotten Realms (AD&D(r) 
game) dragon. 

To create a dragonwight, use normal dragon 
statistics. The resulting horror is immune to at 
tacks by non-magic or non-silver weapons. Its 
touch drains life from victims. 

Dragons slain by a dragonwight rise again as 
half-strength dragonwights. Characters slain by 
the dragonwight rise again as half-strength 
wights under the control of the dragonwight- 
humanoid, but with a distinctly draconic cast to 
their scaley features. 

DQ rules: The dragonwight in the Temple of 
the Dragon Oracle was a black dragon. A dra 
gonwight attacks as a dragon (same Base Chance) 
and does normal dragon damage when it attacks. 
Armor does not absorb the damage. 

Use the low end of the characteristic range 
from the selected dragon type for the dra- 
gonwight's characteristics (even if the actual 
dragon was more powerful in life). Dra 
gonwights wax and wane with the heavens as do 
wights (see wight monster description). They are 
minimum Rank 10 Adepts of the College of Ce 
lestial Magics. Dragonwights cannot be sub 
dued. A dragonwight is a creature of Darkness. 

AD&D(r) rules: The dragonwight in the Tem 
ple of the Dragon Oracle was a 7 HD black 
dragon. It does normal dragon damage when 
it attacks and drains an experience level for 
each attack that hits. See the wight descrip 
tion in Monster Manual I for a description of 
wight abilities, weapon and spell immunities, 
and weaknesses. Refer to the specific 
dragon description for Hit Dice, hit points, 
number of attacks and damage, and walking 
movement. A 6-9 HD dragonwight Turns as a 
Spectre. A 10-13 HD dragonwight Turns as a 
Vampire. A 14+ HD dragonwight turns as a 
ghost. Dragonwights cannot be subdued. All 
dragonwights are of Lawful Evil alignment. 

The X.R for a dragonwight is the same as for 
the living dragon from which it was formed.

Notes: Although Durguid is technically an Adept, he 
considers himself a priest of nature. He associates other 
Adepts with the Black Magic Adept who killed his father 
(a master bow maker and champion archer). Durguid 
wishes to find ways to let man live in harmony with the 
forests, not cut them down to make new Dale lands. 


Notes: Morgana's nickname, "steel-eyed witch" fits the 
outer persona that she chooses to display. More than one 
overamorous bravo has been put in his place by just a 
stare. Still, it is just an act, a defensive mechanism. 
Morgana needs to prove that she is the best, as good or 
better than the tales she fabricates about her exploits- 
and often takes risks that seem at best, unwise.

CHAPTER FOUR: The Statue Reunited 


Encounter Setting 

When the party returns to Volkumburgh, 
allow them to rest and recuperate for as 
long as a week. Regardless of how much 
they demand to see Amelior, he will not 
see them or pay them until he has com 
pleted the penultimate assembly of the 
awtawmatawn. 

During this time, Lychor is not to be 
found anywhere. Even his room is vacant. 
There are no subsequent encounters with 
Valmous during this time. Even the gar 
goyles, wights, and wolves are quiet. 

What if the PCs Don't Find the 
Pieces? 

It is possible that the PCs may decide the 
awtawmatawn and/or Lychor are evil and 
refuse to have anything to do with it. If 
so, Lychor summons his undead allies 
and helps his "friend" Amelior get all 
the pieces (this has always been possible, 
but Lychor avoids personal risk). If the 
party is still in town, they become caught 
up in Wizard War! (encounter #2). If 
they have left, Red Rudyard, the village 
headman, catches up with them and 
pleads for their aid (see "It's Up to You," 
encounter #6). 

"We Be Just Diggin\ Ok?" 

Finding the hand gives treasure hunters 
in town the idea that the lost treasure of 
the Volkumburghs is hidden somewhere 
in the village. They begin digging 
trenches and pits until the town green 
looks like a cratered battlefield. The vil 
lagers do not explain themselves. 

Encounter & Events Key 

Play the encounters and events in the or 
der given. 

1. With Baited Breath 

Erek appears at the PCs' rooms one morn 
ing about a week after they have returned 
with the final piece. In his snide way, he 
states that Amelior wishes the PCs to wit 
ness the final assembly of the statue ... 
and to pick up their pay. 



The clutter in the Alchemist's work 
shop has all been pushed aside and the 
scaffolding disassembled. The bulky 
30-foot-tall statue stands without sup 
port. High overhead, its grimacing 
head hangs above the shoulders in a 
complex web of block and tackle and 
plumbing. It may be just a trick of the 
lighting, but it doesn't seem all that 
wonderful and benevolent looking 
anymore. 

Amelior is frantically adjusting 
knobs on a huge, sealed copper kettle 
that seems to be connected to all those 
pipes overhead. As you enter, the ket 
tle lid rattles and belches foul 
smelling vapor into the room. 


The Alchemist is glad to see the PCs. 
He explains that he is just about to lower 
the head. If his calculations are correct, 
the statue will animate as his potions 
weld the stone together. He begins 
pumping the fluid in the kettle through 
the pipes to the statue's neck. 

The only way the PCs are going to find 
out about their payment right now is to 
ask. In a distinctly annoyed tone, the dis 
tracted Amelior will indicate to the PCs 
that their pay is in the office in a red sack. 
He then ignores the PCs to supervise Erek 
as the little man lowers the massive head. 

There is indeed a red sack in the office. 
In fact there are about fifty red sacks in 
plain view. All but ten contain mineral 
samples. Nine contain other gemstones 
(not rubies) valued at about ldl0xl,000 
SP/g.p. each. One contains the balance 
of payments owed the PCs-between 
20,000 and 100,000 SP/g.p. worth of red 
rubies. It take 20 minutes ( - 2 minutes 
per searcher) to find the right sack. Dur 
ing this time, Amelior completes the aw 
tawmatawn and Encounter #2-Wizard 
War begins (roll Id 10 and add 2. This is 
the number of minutes that elapse be 
tween the time the PCs begin searching 
the office and when Valmous attacks). 

Regardless of what the PCs do here, the 
statue's head will connect with the body. 
The eyes (or eye) begins to glow. At about 
the same time an explosion outside rocks 


the workshop as Encounter #2-Wizard 
War!, begins. 

Note: If the PCs leave for the office for 
even a moment and then return, the of 
fice is cleaned out-everything of value 
and the multitude of chairs is gone (see 
Epilogue for explanation). 

2. Wizard War! 


Near the edge of town, a mushroom 
cloud of smoke climbs into the sky and 
a great winged thing and its rider ap 
pear out of the black billows. The 
sharp crack of thunder drowns out the 
villagers' screams as a brilliant bolt of 
lightning strikes the flyer and its rider. 
Initially it seems that both plummet to 
the ground with a sickening thud; but 
then you notice a small figure floating 
down slowly like a feather. 

A loud pounding on the door and 
cries for help echo in the workshop. 


The villagers want the party to aid 
them against invaders. They are desper 
ate. 

Valmous is attacking Volkumburgh 
from the east. He leads any of the surviv 
ing Rune Adepts (there were a total of 
four) and a small host of 40 neanderthals. 
Valmous is intent on destroying the 
statue (and possibly the PCs whom he be 
lieves responsible for its reconstruction). 
The neanderthals just attack anything in 
their way. 

Simultaneously, a second invasion of 
100 skeletons, 20 zombies and 10 wights 
lumbers up from the south. 

For variety, when the forces of Valmous 
and the undead attack the village, the 
DM may wish to have other players (not 
from the party) take the part of the in 
vaders. 

Lychor casts aside all pretenses of being 
a humble cleric to counterattack against 
both invasions, appearing to defend the 
village. He is just making sure the awtaw 
matawn is completed. Once he sees it 
break out of Amelior's shop, his mission 
ends and he departs. 


29 













3. It Lives! It Laughs! It's Loose! 

Presuming that the party is trying to do 
the right thing, they have probably 
rushed to the front of the invasion along 
the east edge of the village. Let about 
three rounds of combat occur as the PCs 
fight alongside Lychor and 4d6 villagers 
against the invaders. Let the PCs and vil 
lagers get caught in the fringes of one of 
Lychor's more potent spells, possibly kill 
ing a few villagers. The party should get 
the feeling that Lychor could personally 
deal with an army and that he has little 
care for the lives of others. 

In the middle of the third round of 
combat (regardless of who has initiative), 
read the following: 


A deep booming voice, like thunder 
in a cathedral, echoes across the 
scarred battlefield, "I live! I live! Hear 
me world of mortals: I live again. This 
time none shall stop me!" 

Peals of thunderous laughter end 
this pronouncement, followed in turn 
by cracking wood and crumbling stone 
as Amelior's workshop comes crashing 
down around the laughing awtawma- 
tawn. 


The followers of Valmous stop fight 
ing. In fact, every NPC and monster on 
the field stops fighting as all eyes focus on 
the awtawmatawn. When the monster's 
prounouncement has had time to sink in, 
Lychor casts one more deadly spell at Val 
mous and the combatants around him (if 
Valmous is already out of the action, pick 
a target that will do the most damage to 
all concerned). Unprepared for such an 
attack, Valmous is taken out of action for 
the rest of the battle. 

4. Trashing Volkumburgh 

It takes about 10 minutes of rather 
clumsy experimenting for Rotbite, the 
devil (AD&D(r) game: horned devil) who 
controls the golem, to once again become 
comfortable with its control of the awtaw 
matawn. He may try to practice stomping 
the followers of Valmous (keeping both 


the monster and Valmous busy for a 
time). After tiring of pointless exercise 
and being a methodical creature, the 
devil then begins to destroy the town. It 
attacks by kicking or crushing buildings 
and stepping on any people or livestock it 
can find. It destroys buildings in no par 
ticular order, except to begin with the 
closest building. 

Sometime during the creature's ram 
page, it will attack the Crimson Wyrm 
and in so doing, reveal its hidden trea 
sure; and will crush Amelior's workshop 
into little teeny-tiny splinters (including 
any magical items, potions, devices, and 
red bags of gemstones). 

Building Bashing 

Each building in Volkumburgh has a 
structural rating. This is the number of 
points of structural damage a building 
must sustain before it comes crashing 
down (although most of the building 
may be destroyed without it falling down 
all the way). The structural rating and 
construction material for each building 
are listed adjacent to each building on the 
DM Map of Volkumburgh (Map 7). 

The awtawmatawn, seige machines, 
and, eventually, the PCs will be able to do 
structural damage to the buildings. Each 
time a building takes one or more points 
of damage, keep track of the damage by 
marking the map. 

The awtawmatawn's attacks do 8 
points of structural damage to wood con 
struction, 3 points to earthen construc 
tion, 5 points to soft stone or brick 
construction, and 2 points to hard rock 
construction. If the giant golem just steps 
on something, it does half the above 
damage. 

5. What about Amelior? 

Amelior survived the destruction of his 
workshop, but just barely (figure that 
he's taken about 80% damage-he's in 
no condition to fight or cast spells). If the 
party looks for him, Erek, or their gems, 
it will take ld6 minutes of searching to 
find the man. 


Aou find Amelior and Erek trapped 
together in the rubble. It takes several 
minutes to find them, but when you 
do, you realize that Erek is dead. He 
had apparently shielded the Alche 
mist with his own body and in doing 
so grew to over six feet in height. 


Amelior is a bundle of complex and 
confused emotions right now. He is grief- 
stricken over the loss of his assistant; both 
aghast and embarrassed about having 
created a menace; angry at being tricked 
by Lychor, whom he trusted; and con 
fused about what to do. He keeps mum 
bling "Whatever shall we do, Erek? 
Whatever shall we do?" 

If the PCs search Amelior or ask for 
magical assistance or search his clothing, 
they will come up with all he has to offer: 
seven potions and three sealed brass bot 
tles. Three of the bottles are labeled as 
potions of growth that will cause the 
drinker to grow to 30 feet tall if all is im 
bibed (five "mini-swigs" of 6-foot 
growth each), and three more are labeled 
as potions of giant strength that if im 
bibed will grant the powers of one of the 
types of giantkind (see table below). The 
last one states only "drink me if all else 
fails." For the descripton of this potion's 
effects, see encounter #7. 

One of the brass bottles is labeled "Ha 
san" and contains Amelior's guardian 
djinn. The other is labeled "The guys" 
and contains his devoted ogres (see Ame 
lior's NPC description). The third is la 
beled "ballista" and contains a ballista 
siege machine (like a giant crossbow), 20 
ballista bolts, and a crew of four zombie 
artillerists. 

Ballista: range 10 to 920 feet. Damage 
to awtawmatawn: DQ rules: 1D10 + 2; 
AD&D(r) game: 2d6 (the magical nature 
of the golem prevents these from doing 
full damage). DQ rules Base Chance: 
40%. AD&D(r) game "To Hit" chance: 
11. Rate of fire: one shot every four com 
bat rounds. Structural points: 2. 

After the party gets these items, Ame 
lior wanders off weeping with Erek's body 
cradled in his arms. He flees Volkum- 


30 















burgh, taking all his goods with him (see 
Epilogue). 

6. "It's Up To You" 

About the time that party should have 
Amelior's supplies (or if they are still hav 
ing a problem figuring out what to do), a 
harried looking Red Rudyard (the village 
headman and innkeeper) comes up and 
pleads, "We are lost, it's up to you. Save 
us and whatever we have is yours." 

What should happen is that several 
members of the party should drink one 
each of the growth and giant strength po 
tions (Note: characters who grow do only 
+ 1 additional damage/6 feet of growth 
if they do not also drink the giant 
strength potion). The rest of the party 
should cast spells and guide the zombie 
artillery crew. 

If PCs drink the giant strength potion, 
roll ld20 on the table below to determine 
the type of strength gained. 

d20 Type Damage Throw

This damage is added to bonuses for 
growth. 

* DQ rules: This is an AD&D(r) game 
rules convention indicating increments 
of 10 feet indoors or 10 yards outdoors. 

7. "Drink Me If All Else Fails" 

Drinking Amelior's potion with this label 
transforms the imbiber into a mature red 
dragon (use Flashfire's stats). The charac 
ter who drinks the potion is now one of 
the fiercest fighting machines in the 
world and can probably make short work 
of the awtawmatawn. However, the trans 
formation is permanent and cannot be re 
moved by spell magic (neither a DQ 
rules counterspell nor AD&D(r) game c//s- 
pel magic will work). A quest or undis 


covered ritual of the DM's devising is 
needed to return the character to normal. 

Although the player may think that 
being a red dragon is a wonderful idea, 
the character should eventually become 
an NPC because he eventually becomes 
dragonish and evil. The dragon-character 
will also be the focus of attention by the 
Dragon Cult, wizards, alchemists (who 
want pieces of dragon), and other adven 
turers. Furthermore, if the dragon plaza 
at the Temple of the Dragon Oracle was 
left intact, the character must make 
weekly saving throws (DQ rules: 
3xWillpower; AD&D(r) game: saving 
throw vs. wands at character's original 
class and level) or succumb to its siren 
call. 

8. The Secret Cave (Map 
7-Inset #2) 

When the awtawmatawn crushes the 
Crimson Wyrm, it falls, like a man step 
ping unawares into a hidden post hole. 
The golem has collapsed the ceiling of a 
hidden cave beneath the inn. Should 
anyone take the time to look in the hole, 
they see a huge pile of treasure. 

The lost Volkumburgh Treasure has 
lain here for centuries, only 50 feet be 
neath the village. A narrow passageway 
connects with a trap door buried beneath 
where the awtawmatawn's hand was 
hidden-under the fountain in the 
green. 

9. The Lost Treasure of the 
Volkumburghs 


Although it's not quite a dragon's 
hoard, there's enough treasure here to 
make up for anything lost in Amelior's 
shop and Red Rudyard did say that all 
they had was yours. 

Of course, Red Rudyard didn't know 
about the treasure then. Although the 
villagers are more than glad to be saved, 
they are not very pleased with the idea of 
giving THEIR treasure to a bunch of for 
eign thugs who, after all, were responsi 
ble for bringing the awtawmatawn back 


to life. 

If the PCs just take the treasure, they 
make enemies of the entire village. 
Something like this could unify them and 
start a blood feud against the PCs. The 
villagers were already talking about using 
THEIR treasure to buy assassins to elimi 
nate both Amelior Amanitas (where is 
he?) and Lychor. 

If, on the other hand, the PCs let the 
villagers have the whole thing, they are 
being taken advantage of. Let the party 
argue with the stubborn villagers until a 
workable solution is achieved. The vil 
lagers will not willingly settle for less than 
50% of the treasure. 

If unscrupulous PCs decide that the 
world won't miss one tiny unknown vil 
lage more or less, you may wish to prevent 
wholesale slaughter by having Valmous 
and his surviving followers show up in 
time to save the day (possibly with an 
other 50 neanderthals). He decides to re 
create the College of Shaping magics 
right here in Volkumburgh and will back 
up the villagers' claims. 

The treasure is worth 175,000 SP/g.p. 
and consists mainly of bulky gilded and 
gemmed art objects, a squad of elegant 
marble statues of athletes, a few boxes of 
gold coins, a large collection of ancient 
religious articles made of precious metals, 
at least ten well-preserved books of his 
tory, a bag or two of gemstones, and one 
minor magical item of the DM's choos 
ing. Be creative in making up an "Oh 
Wow, lookit all dat stuff!" treasure. 

If the PCs agree to divide the Treasure 
of Volkumburgh with the surviving vil 
lagers, they are treated (at least out 
wardly) as friends and even heroes. If the 
PCs try to resurrect the dead villagers, 
they are treated with true respect. If the 
PCs act like miserly bullies, then they are 
treated coldly (OK, they're treated like 
rancid pond scum). 

Epilogue 

As previously mentioned, the villagers 
have decided to punish Amelior and Ly 
chor for destroying their village and kill 
ing their families (treasure won't easily 
resurrect lost loved ones). 

If the party looks for Amelior Amani- 

31 














tas, they will not find him or Erek's body. ables and then return with them to the Things will eventually

ARCANE WISDOM is a supplement to the 
DRAGONQUEST(r) fantasy role-playing 
game. As such, the material in this appendix 
is not usable alone. You must have 
the DRAGONQUEST game in order to use 
the information contained here. 

Only a portion of the original ARCANE 
WISDOM material is included in this 
supplement-specifically, two new Colleges 
of Magic: The College of Rune Magics and the 
College of Shaping Magics. The chapter and 
section numbering of the original DQ rules 
has been retained for ease of reference. 


88. Incorporating New Colleges into 
the Game 

The new Colleges of Magic in this booklet op 
erate in all ways identically to the original 12 
Colleges in the DRAGONQUEST(r) rules 
proper. Each College possesses a General 
Knowledge and Special Knowledge Counter 
spell, and these are known to Adepts of the 
College of Naming Incantations, just as other 
counterspells are. The Colleges of Rune Mag 
ics and Shaping Magics are part of the Entit 
ies. Ail of the provisions of Sections 25 
through 35 of the DRAGONQUEST rules ap 
ply to these Colleges. 


The GM who is concerned with maintain 
ing continuity may have to invent a rationale, 
explaining why players have been unaware of 
these new Colleges (The Shattered Statue at 
tempts to do just that). Also, the Namers of 
his or her world should be given certain allow 
ances pertinent to the knowledge of the coun 
terspells for these Colleges, especially for a 
character who has risen in power and knowl 
edge of all other counterspells. Possibly a tem 
porary reduction of the required study time or 
Experience Point cost may be implemented to 
allow a Namer an opportunity to catch up. 


90. The College of Rune Magics 

The College of Rune Magics is concerned with 
the use of special symbols of power to shape 
mana into desired forms. A Rune is a graphic 
symbol representing some actual, elemental, 
or mystical force. In rare cases, additional 
Runes may be developed or discovered which 
employ parts of existing Runes. However, 
much of the power of the runes derives from 
their constant usage over many centuries, and 
most useful Runes will be known to all Adepts 
of this College (or at least be readily available 
to them with a very little bit of research). 

In addition to the power of the Runes 
themselves, part of the power of this College 
derives from the use of special materials to 
construct the Runewands and Runesticks into 
which the Runes are usually inscribed. The 
Runewand Table and the Runestick Chart de 
scribe the special properties of various types of 
Runewands and Runesticks. 

Adepts of the College of Rune Magics may 
use their talent magic without restriction and 
may use some spells by merely inscribing the 
appropriate Rune on an item to be enchanted. 
In most cases, spells and rituals of this College 
require the Adept to employ Runesticks or his 
personal Runewand in casting the spell or per 
forming the ritual. 

As part of his initiation into the mysteries of 
this College, the Adept is required to prepare 
a Runewand for himself. Usually, one or more 
of his teachers will participate in the endeavor 
as well. If the Runewand being manufactured 
is of exceptionally costly materials, the Adept 
will be required to go into debt to pay for 
those materials, but in most cases the material 
will be of some cheap, common wood, and 
the Adept's labor during his apprenticeship 
will be sufficient to cover the cost. 

Runewands are of three types: Rods, Staffs, 
and Sceptres. All three operate in basically the 


same manner. However, in addition to its 
magical properties, a Staff may be used as a 
normal weapon, having exactly the same char 
acteristics as a quarterstaff (although it is usu 
ally lighter in construction). A Sceptre may 
also be used as a weapon, having the charac 
teristics of a ceremonial mace. A Rod may 
never be used as a weapon, since it is often 
nothing more than a switch or hollow tube, 
looking much like the traditional magic 
wand. 

When a character is initiated into the Col 
lege of Rune Magics, the character's player 
rolls dlOO and consults the Runewand Table to 
determine the type of Runewand the Adept 
receives from his teachers. An Adept may later 
equip himself with a different type of Rune 
wand or create (or purchase) another Rune 
wand of the same type to replace a previously 
possessed Runewand that has been damaged, 
destroyed, or stolen. An Adept may own any 
number of Runewands, but may use only one 
at a time. 

Runewands are created by performing the 
Ritual of Fashioning Runewand (Q-2). Rune 
wands are considered magical weapons for all 
purposes and definitions. 

In order to use a Runewand manufactured 
by someone else, the Adept must successfully 
read the Runes inscribed on the Runewand, 
using Talent T-3. If he fails to do so, he may 
not use the Runewand. Even if he successfully 
reads the Runes inscribed on a Runewand 
which he did not manufacture, the Adept still 
suffers a penalty when using the Runewand. 
The Base Chance for any spell or ritual per 
formed with the aid of that Runewand is re 
duced by 20. 

Runesticks are small sticks carved of various 
woods or soft materials (which do not interfere 
with the flow of mana) and incised with Runes 
appropriate to the purpose of the Runesticks. 
Unlike Runewands, Runesticks are not multi 


purpose tools which can be used for a variety 
of spells or rituals. They are specifically cre 
ated to work with a single spell or ritual. Ex 
ception: The Warding Rune is used in a 
variety of spells and rituals, and Runesticks 
containing this Rune may be used in any of 
them. Runesticks are fashioned and prepared 
using the Ritual of Fashioning Runesticks (Q- 
1) and may be manufactured of any material 
listed on the Runestick Chart. 

An Adept may use Runesticks fashioned by 
someone else, but he must first successfully 
read the Runes incised on them. The Base 
Chance is reduced by 10 when an Adept at 
tempts to perform a ritual or cast a spell with 
Runesticks not of his manufacture. 

In some cases, the Adept may have to draw 
or carve a Rune into some object to be en 
chanted instead of using Runesticks or a 
Runewand to perform the magic. In order to 
write the rune, the Adept may use any sub 
stance that will mark the surface of the object 
to be enchanted. However, some substances 
will work better than others at creating the de 
sired enchantment (see 90.2). Any tool may 
be used to carve a Rune into a substance, so 
long as the tool is hard enough to do the job 
and it is not composed of Cold Iron. Excep 
tion: The Adept may use a tool containing 
Cold Iron if the Cold Iron is neutralized as per 
29.1. 


33 














The Base Chance of performing a talent, 
spell, or ritual of the College of Rune Magics is 
modified by the addition of the following 
numbers: 

The talent, spell or ritual requires the use of 
Runesticks, and the Runesticks used by the 


Adept are... 

Made of Gilded Metal 20 

Made of Silvered Metal 15 

Made of Mistletoe 10 

Made of Ashwood 8 

Made of Oak 8 

Made of Cedarwood 5 

Made of Aspenwood 3 

Made of Chestnut 3 

Made of Pinewood - 5 

Made of Yarrow - 5 

Manufactured by someone 

other than the Adept -10 


The talent, spell or ritual requires the use of 
a Runewand, and the Runewand used by the 


Adept is... 

A Truesilver Sceptre 25 

A Gilded Sceptre 22 

A Copper Rod 18 

An Ebony Rod 14 

An Ivory Rod 12 

An Ash Staff 10 

A Cedar Rod 10 

A Blackthorne Staff 8 

A Bronze Sceptre 8 

An Oak Staff 5 

A Willow Rod 2 

Manufactured by someone 

other than the Adept - 20 


The talent, spell or ritual requires drawing 
of a Rune on an object to be enchanted and 
the substance used to draw the Rune is... 


Fresh blood from a dragon 50 

Fresh blood from a member of a 
character race 20 

Ink impregnated with particles of 
platinum* 15 

Ink impregnated with particles of 
gold** 10 

Ink impregnated with particles of sil 
ver*** 5 

Fresh blood from a mammalian be 
ing 5 


?Average cost of 90 Silver Pennies for enough 
ink to draw one Rune (i.e. to cast one spell). 
** Average cost of 60 Silver Pennies for 
enough ink to draw one Rune. 

*** Average cost of 5 Silver Pennies for 
enough ink to draw one Rune. 

In all cases, the weight of one vial with suf 
ficient ink to draw one Rune is 5 ounces. It 
normally takes one minute to draw a Rune. 

In most cases, these modifiers are not cu- 

34 



mulative. As an exception, modifiers for the 
type of Runewand or Runestick used are 
added to the modifiers pertaining to materials 
of a particular type. 

In addition, the Cast Chance is affected 
by all modifiers listed in 27.7 of the 
DRAGONQUEST(r) rules, except that the 
number of hours spent preparing a spell has 
no effect on the Cast Chance of the spell, as is 
the case in other Colleges. Rune Magicians 
may not engage in Ritual Spell Preparation as 
outlined in 32.1. 

The Rank of an Adept in the Ritual of Fash 
ioning Runewand and the Ritual of Fashion 
ing Runestick do not affect the efficacy of a 
spell cast using the Runesticks or Runewand 
created via those rituals. It affects only the ac 
tual performance of the rituals of fashioning. 

T. Talents-College of Rune 
Magics 

T-l. Read Ancient Languages 
All Adepts of the College of Rune Magics have 
a 10 % chance (+ 3 / Rank) of knowing any an 
cient (including "dead") language or dialect 
encountered at a Rank equal to their Rank 
with this talent. There is a 40% chance (+ 3/ 
Rank) that the Adept will be able to puzzle 


out the type of language if he does not know 
it. If the Adept puzzles out the language 
(from clues such as root words in known lan 
guages), he will have Rank with the language 
equal to half his Rank with this talent (round 
up) after spending 20 hours (- 30 minutes/ 
Rank with this talent) attempting to master 
the nuances of the language. An ancient lan 
guage may be studied in this manner either 
via written word (tomes, inscriptions, etc.), in 
which case, the language is known only in 
written form, or via communication with a 
speaker of the language (in which case, the 
language may be known only in oral form, un 
less the speaker can be persuaded to explain a 
written alphabet.) 

An Adept may increase Rank with an an 
cient language that he has puzzled out by 
spending one week per Rank practicing the 
language until he knows it at the same Rank as 
his Rank with this talent. If he wishes to gain 
Rank with an ancient language which is 
greater than his Rank with this talent, he must 
follow the normal procedure to gain Rank 
with a language as described in 49 and 87 (in 
the DRAGONQUEST(r) rules). Rank with this 
talent is exactly analogous to Rank with spo 
ken or written languages as described in 49. 
Thus, a character of Rank 5 with this talent 
would be able to read and/or write an ancient 
language he knew with the proficiency of 
someone who knew that language at Rank 5 
(3,000 to 5,000-word vocabulary, concepts pe 
culiar to the language or alien to the character 
understood). This talent's Experience Multi 
ple is 250. 

T-2. Decipher Codes and Ciphers 
Any Adept of this College has a 25% chance 
(+ 3 / Rank) of being able to break any code or 
cipher if he studies it for 12 hours (-1 / Rank, 
+ 1 / Rank of the Adept who created the code 
or cipher with T-4). The Adept's chances of 
breaking a cipher or code are decreased by 3 
for every Rank the Adept who created the 
code or cipher had with T-4 (Create Codes and 
Ciphers) of this College. The Adept must con 
centrate on breaking the code or cipher for an 
unbroken period of time equal to that neces 
sary to break the code or cipher before a dlOO 
roll can be made (by the GM) to determine his 
success. This talent's Experience Multiple is 
250. 

T-3. Read Runesticks 

Any Adept of this College has a 30% chance 
(+ 3/Rank, - 3 /Rank of the crater with Q-l) 
to successfully read the Runesticks of another 
Adept of the College of Rune Magics without 
assistance. If assisted by whoever created the 
Runesticks, there is a 70% chance (+ 3/Rank, 













-3 /Rank of the creator with Q-l) of detect 
ing misinformation given in the guise of as 
sistance. Only Runesticks which have been 
successfully read may be employed to cast a 
spell or perform a ritual of this College. 
Runesticks which have been "successfully" 
read, but incorrectly assessed due to false as 
sistance, may be used, but they will automati 
cally backfire. The GM always rolls to 
determine the success or failure at the mo 
ment this talent is applied. An Adept auto 
matically reads the runes (though not 
necessarily correctly) when assisted by the cre 
ator of the Runes. This talent's Experience 
Multiple is 100. 

T-4. Create Codes and Ciphers 
An Adept of the College of Rune Magics can 
create a code or cipher which a normal charac 
ter or NPC would have only a 1 % chance of 
breaking, but which another Adept of this 
College would have a greater chance of break 
ing. The Rank of the code or cipher's creator 
modifies all attempts to break the code or ci 
pher by ~3/Rank. The Experience Multiple 
for this talent is 150. It takes one hour to cre 
ate a code or cipher. 

T-5. Summon Wand 

An Adept can summon to him any Runewand 
he has created that is within 10 feet ( + 10/ 
Rank) of him. The Adept simply wills the 
wand to come to him (requires a Pass Action 
in combat) and the Runewand leaps into his 
hand. The Base Chance to successfully use this 
talent is 40% ( +3/Rank). The Experience 
Multiple for this talent is 250. Note: This tal 
ent can operate only if the path between the 
Adept and his Runewand is not blocked by 
anything through which the Runewand could 
not normally pass (such as a wall or person). 
Only the Runewand is summoned; nothing 
surrounding or attached to it travels with it.

G-l. Detect Aura Spell 
Base Chance: 45 %. 

Range: Unlimited within sight. 

Duration: Immediate. 

Resist: May only be actively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 100. The Adept must 
point his Runewand at the object of the spell 
and pronounce the name of the Detect Aura 
Rune. The spell then operates in the same 
manner as the Detect Aura talent (T-l) of the 
College of Naming Incantations (see 
DRAGONQUEST(r) game rules, 39.3). 


G-2. Spell of Darkness 
Base Chance: 45 %. 

Range: 15 feet (+ 15/Rank). 

Duration: 15 minutes/Rank. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 75. 

The Adept creates a volume of darkness (1000 
cubic feet) of any shape he desires. At Ranks 1 
through 5, the spell creates darkness equal to a 
cloudy night. At 6 through 10, it creates dark 
ness equal to a sealed room. At Rank 11 or 
higher, it creates absolute blackness that no 
non-magical light source (including torches) 
can penetrate. The volume of darkness created 
may be increased by 500 cubic feet/Rank. In 
all cases, the darkness will emanate from the 
tip of the Adept's Runewand, but will last for 
only so long as the Runewand remains unbro 
ken in the Adept's possession. 

G-3. Spell of Light 

Base Chance: 50%. 

Range: 15 feet (+15/Rank). 

Duration: 15 minutes/Rank (xl, if un 
ranked). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 75. 

One 10-foot cube (1000 cubic feet) area may 
be brightly lit. The lighted area may be any 
shape (even pencil thin), but must emanate 
from the tip of the Adept's Runewand and 
will last for only so long as the Runewand re 
mains unbroken in the Adept's possession. 

G-4. Spell of Pyrogenesis 
Base Chance: 40 %. 

Range: Touch of Runewand. 

Duration: Immediate (during pulse). 

Resist: May only be passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 75. 

One small flammable object or entity may be 
caused to burst into flame by the touch of the 
Adept's Runewand. Thereafter, the flames are 
fueled by the object or entity. They may be ex 
tinguished normally. Note this spell is meant 
to be used to light matches and cause insects 
and small furry animals to burst into flames. It 
is not meant for use against human-sized fig 
ures. 

G-5. Curse Spell 

Base Chance: 35%. 

Range: Touch with Runewand. 

Duration: Until dispelled by the appropriate 
counterspell. 

Resist: May be actively and passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 400. 

The Adept may curse one target (which he 
must touch with his Runewand) with any of 
the possible minor curses listed (following) 
that he has the necessary Rank to employ 


(Rank: Possible curse). The touch is auto 
matic, but the spell must be prepared nor 
mally. 

1-8: The adept may afflict the target with hal 
lucinations that will reduce the target's Per 
ception by 5 in addition to any specific effects. 
The GM and the Adept must work out the ex 
act nature of the hallucination at the time that 
the curse is made. Hallucinations should, 
however, be of a minor, generalized nature: 
seeing colored lights in the distance, hearing 
sounds like the clanking of weaponry, smell 
ing meat cooking from time to time, and so 
forth. The severity of the hallucinations (and 
the decrease in Perception) will be more pro 
nounced if the spell takes double or triple ef 
fect. 

6-10: The Adept may afflict the target with 
increasing physical debilitation that will de 
crease Physical Strength by 1 immediately, 
and will subtract 1 from Endurance at the end 
of each day until the curse is dispelled. 

11-15: The Adept may afflict the target 
with total loss of any one sense (sight, smell, 
touch, hearing, taste) for a number of weeks 
equal to the Adept's Rank with this spell. The 
loss of senses takes place immediately. 

16-20: The Adept may afflict the target with 
extreme paranoia and nightmares. The target 
will recover only 1 Fatigue Point per hour 
from taking a nap, and only 2 per from sleep 
ing. In addition, the target will feel hag 
ridden and imagine himself pursued by 
phantasms. He will, unless the curse is first 
dispelled, eventually become more and more 
estranged from reality, distrustful of friends 
and companions, and obsessed with the idea 
of destroying his enemies (who he thinks are 
"all around"). If the curse is not dispelled 
within DlOx a number of days equal to the 
Willpower of the target (minus 2x the Adept's 
Rank with this spell), the target will com 
pletely lose touch with reality. He will then 
plot to destroy his friends in the belief that 
they are "out to get him" and will exhibit 
other bizarre behavior. He will be cured of the 
advanced stage of this affliction only by hav 
ing the curse dispelled and then spending a 
number of days equal to the Adept's 
RankxDIO in rest and recuperation. 

G-6. Spell of Illusion 

Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: Unlimited within sight. 

Duration: Until dispelled by the appropriate 
counterspell. 

Resist: Must be disbelieved instead of resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 200. 

The Adept places a single Runestick carved 
with the Rune for this spell and a Rune repre- 

35 













senting an object or entity of his choice on the 
ground, afloat in the water, etc. The stick will 
then appear to all except the Adept to be the 
same object or entity as the Rune incised on 
the Runestick. The image will be inanimate 
and will remain even when touched. How 
ever, the illusion can be disbelieved and as 
signed a difficulty factor, as outlined in 38 
(DRAGONQUEST(r) rules), based on the 
Adept's Rank with this spell. 

The illusion will appear to be full-sized, 
even though the small stick represents the ob 
ject or entity, and will have tactile, auditory, 
olfactory, and visual elements (although it will 
lack the mobility of the object it represents). 

G-7. Control Entity Spell 

Base Chance: 10%. 

Range: Target must be bound to Runesticks. 
Duration: So long as Runesticks are worn. 
Resist: May be actively and passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 550. 

The Adept must successfully bind three 
Runesticks containing the binding Rune onto 
the entity being controlled. This may mean 
that the Adept or one or more of his compan 
ions will have to enter Close Combat with the 
entity in order to bind the sticks to it (50% 
Base Chance). In other cases, the Adept 
maybe able to induce the entity to put the 
sticks on itself voluntarily (via trickery, for ex 
ample). Once the sticks are in place, a Cast 
Check is immediately made to determine 
whether or not the sticks function. The spell 
need not be prepared, and no Fatigue is ex 
pended to cause it to take effect. 

This is an exception to the normal casting of 
a spell which is mandated by the unusual nat 
ure of the Runesticks. Once cast, this spell re 
mains in effect until the Runesticks are no 
longer bound to the target (who may not re 
move them himself unless so commanded by 
the binder). Until that time, the target will 
freely do the bidding of the Adept, acting in 
all ways as his loyal servant (even to the extent 
of fighting anyone trying to remove the 
Runesticks from him). 

G-8. Spell of Purification 

Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: Substance must be touched with 
Runestick. 

Duration: Immediate. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 100. 

The Adept may turn any aqueous substance 
into potable water by touching the substance 
with a Runestick that has had a Purification 
Rune incised into it. The Adept may purify 1 
quart (+ 1/Rank) by volume with this spell. 
Note: This spell may be used to neutralize 

36 


poison in solution. 

G-9. Runelock Spell 

Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: Target must be painted with Rune. 
Duration: Until dispelled or broken. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 200. 

This spell may be cast over any portal (door or 
window) that can normally be opened or 
closed. It effectively locks the portal with an 
unpickable lock. The portal may still be 
forced open by brute strength. In this case, 
the Physical Strength of all the figures at 
tempting to force the portal are totalled and 
multiplied by the Difficulty Factor of the task. 
The Difficulty Factor is always a function of 
the Rank of the spell: if the Rank of the spell is 
1-5, the Difficulty Factor is 2.0; if Rank 6-10, 
the Difficulty Factor is 1.5; if Rank 11-20, the 
Difficulty Factor is 1.0. In order to place a 
Runelock on a portal, the Adept must draw or 
paint the Runelock Rune on the portal. He 
may only then cast the spell. 

Q. General Knowledge Rituals 
College of Rune Magics 

Q-l. Ritual of Fashioning Runesticks 
The Adept must use this ritual to actually 
carve the appropriate Rune(s) on a stick fash 
ioned of any material listed in 90.4 (The 
Runestick Chart). At the time the Adept fash 
ions the Runestick, the Adept/s player must 
announce what Runes are being cut into the 
stick (i.e., what spell or ritual the Runestick 
can be used to perform). Careful records must 
be kept of the number and type of Runesticks 
carried by a character. Whenever an Adept 
wishes to cast a spell or perform a ritual using 
the Runesticks in his possession, he prepares 
the spell or performs the ritual normally using 
the Runestick(s) only to cast a spell once it is 
prepared. Until a spell is cast, the Runestick is 
unaffected by the preparation. However, once 
a Cast Check is made, whether successful or 
not, the Runesticks used in that spell or ritual 
are used up. They retain the power necessary 
to keep the spell or ritual in effect for its nor 
mal duration, but are otherwise of no magical 
value. They can never be "recharged" or re 
used, although the materials they comprise 
may be refashioned (see note). Once they 
have been fashioned as a part of this ritual, 
Runesticks are permanently imbued with the 
power of the spell or ritual represented by the 
Rune(s) cut into them. Only one spell or ritual 
may be imbued in each stick. It takes a length 
of time equal to that listed on the "Time" 
column of the Runestick Chart (- 1/Rank, 


but with a minimum of 1 minute) to perform 
this ritual. Only one stick may be produced 
per ritual. It costs 10 Fatigue points ("1/ 
three Ranks or fraction) to perform the ritual, 
and the Base Chance of successfully perform 
ing it is 55% ( + 3/Rank), and there is no 
backfire. This ritual's Experience Multiple is 
100. 

The actual materials in a Runestick, once 
used in a spell, may be used to fashion new 
Runesticks for future spell-casting. This re 
quires a new Ritual of Fashioning Runesticks, 
during which the Runesticks are refashioned 
(carved or cast). Runesticks used in a spell or 
ritual that backfires are destroyed (burned 
up), and the materials may not be refashioned 
into new Runesticks or used for any purpose, 
magical or otherwise. 

Q-2. Ritual of Fashioning Runewand 
The Adept may employ this ritual to create a 
Runewand out of any of the materials listed 
on the Runewand Table. The implement is 
fashioned by inscribing Runes into the materi 
al's surface, which describe its use, name, and 
history. Once the Runewand has been fash 
ioned and consecrated in this ritual, it remains 
fully effective unless and until it is broken or 
otherwise destroyed. It takes from one to four 
weeks to perform this ritual, depending on 
the type of material used to fashion the Rune 
wand. The total time necessary to fashion a 
Runewand is decreased by 1 day for each Rank 
the Adept has with this ritual (minimum of 1 
day to perform the ritual), and the ritual costs 
10 Endurance (-1/two Ranks with this rit 
ual). The Endurance loss will heal normally. 
The Adept may interrupt the ritual to eat and 
attend to housekeeping (maximum two hours 
per day) and to sleep (maximum eight hours 
per day), but any break of longer than 10 
hours results in the ritual failing and the ma 
terials used being ruined. Any Endurance ex 
pended on this ritual is expended upon 
completion of the ritual, not during its 
course. Once the ritual is completed, the 
Adept determines whether or not it was suc 
cessful. The Base Chance for this ritual is 30% 
( + 3/Rank). All materials used in an unsuc 
cessful ritual (or a ritual that backfires) are de 
stroyed or ruined. If the ritual is successful, 
the Adept may use the Runewand thereafter 
to cast spells and perform rituals that require 
the use of a Runewand. 

In addition, he may store a maximum of 1 
Fatigue Point in the Runewand at Rank 0, and 
an additional 1 Fatigue Point for ever 2 or frac 
tion Ranks he has with the Ritual of Fashion 
ing Runewand at the time the Runewand is 
fashioned. Fatigue is stored in a Runewand 
simply by touching the Runewand and willing 














one or more Fatigue Points to enter the Rune- 
wand. Fatigue Points stored in the Runewand 
are subtracted from the Fatigue of the Adept. 
Once stored in the Runewand, Fatigue Points 
remain there indefinitely and can be used by 
the Adept to cast spells at any time that he is 
holding the Runewand while making a Cast 
Check. A character may add Fatigue to a 
Runewand any number of times, so long as 
the Runewand has the capacity remaining to 
store the Fatigue each time the wand is "re 
charged." The Experience Multiple for this rit 
ual is 300. 

Q-3. Ritual of Warding with Runesticks 
The Adept sets up a pattern of Runesticks in 
scribed with the Ward Rune (as fashioned by 
Q-l). This pattern may consist of three, five or 
seven sticks composed of any material listed in 
90.9. If three Runesticks are used, the Base 
Chance for this ritual is 20%. If five sticks are 
used, the Base Chance is 30%. If seven sticks 
are used, the Base Chance is 40%. All Base 
Chances are increased by 4 per Rank. This rit 
ual takes two hours (-15 minutes/Rank) to 
complete. During the ritual, the Adept must 
place the Runesticks containing the Runeward 
symbol in a roughly circular configuration 
around the area to be warded (presumably re 
maining inside that area). At the end of the 
ritual, if it is successful, a Runeward exists that 
will help to protect those inside it from magic. 
No magical item (amulet, talisman, weapon, 
etc.) can be brought into the warded area, 
though items already inside the warded area 
can be taken out. The area to be warded is a 
circle with a diameter, in feet, of (lOx) the 
number of sticks used. 

Any magical creature or Adept attempting 
to enter the warded area must make a Resist 
ance Check, or it will be unable to enter the 
area. The entity's Magic Resistance is de 
creased by a number equal to the Rank of the 
Adept with this ritual for a three-Runestick 
ward, twice the Rank for a five-Runestick 
ward, and three times the Adept's Rank for a 
seven-Runestick ward. In addition, if the 
Runesticks used are all of Rowan, no entity 
which is wholly or partially of another plane 
(such as demons, devils, imps, hellhounds) 
will ever be able to cross the Runeward to en 
ter the warded area. The Runeward is auto 
matically and permanently broken if any 
magical entity or magic-user succeeds in pass 
ing it. However, so long as it is in effect, all 
spells cast into (not out of) the warded area 
will have their Base Chance reduced by 20 if it 
is a three-Runestick ward, by 30 if it is a five- 
Runestick ward, and by 40 if it is a seven- 
Runestick ward. Backfire from this ritual 
results not only in the destruction of the 


Runesticks, but in dlO damage to the Adept's 
Endurance as well. 

The same Runesticks which are used for this 
ritual may be used in the Ritual of Healing 
(Q-4) and may also be used in conjunction 
with the Runestick(s) necessary to the casting 
of some other spell of this College to create a 
Ward as described in 32.4. The Experience 
Multiple for this ritual is 200. 

Q-4. Ritual of Healing 
The Adept creates a warded area by setting up 
a Runeward as described in Q-3. However, 
only the seven-Runestick Runeward may be 
used. The Runeward is set up around the en 
tity to be healed. The Runeward used for heal 
ing in this manner also confers on those within 
the warded area the same protection as does 
Q-3, but the Runeward is broken if anyone in 
side exits it during the ritual, and the ritual 
must be abandoned or started from scratch. 
The Runesticks used are consumed as though 
the ritual had been performed to its conclu 
sion. The Base Chance for this ritual is 50% 

(+4/Rank). It lasts seven hours at the end of 
which any one living entity within the Rune 
ward (Adept's choice as to who) is cured of all 
Fatigue and Endurance losses, plus any non- 
magical diseases, fevers, or infections from 
which the entity may suffer. It is possible for 
the ritual to backfire. If it does so, the entity 
being healed instead dies immediately. The 
Adept must expend 10 Fatigue to employ this 
ritual. It has an Experience Multiple of 150. 

Any types of material listed in 90.4 may be 
used to make Runesticks used in this ritual ex 
cept for Elder and Yew. In addition, if the 
Runesticks used in this ritual are made of Wal 
nut or Elm, the number of hours the ritual re 
quires is reduced to five. 

Q-5. Runes of Sight 

The Adept may gain insight in the future by 
casting the Runes of Sight (Runesticks which 
have Runes cut into them representing the 
cosmic balance). It takes one hour to cast these 
Runes and the Adept may perform no other 
action during that time. The performance of 
this ritual allows the Adept to exercise any of 
the following functions during its course: 

A. Limited Precognition: This action is exe 
cuted as a talent, but with the same results as 
for the Spell of Limited Precognition (G-2) of 
the College of Sorceries of the Mind. It has a 
Base Chance of 30% ( +2/Rank). 

B. Divining Enchantment: This action is exe 
cuted as a ritual in the same manner as the Rit 
ual of Divination (R-l) of the College of 
Naming Incantations. It has a Base Chance of 
55% (+4/Rank). 


Only one of these two options may be per 
formed at each casting of the Runes of Sight. 
The Experience Multiple for this ritual is 150. 
It requires three Runesticks incised with the 
appropriate Runes to perform this ritual. 

Q-6. Ritual of Sending 
The Adept must paint his forehead with a 
Sending Rune before retiring to sleep at 
night. He then will spend an entire eight- 
hour period (or until awakened) in communi 
cation with an entity of his choice who is also 
sleeping during that time. The entity may re 
sist the communication through successful 
Passive Resistance. Otherwise, the entity will 
answer all questions in a yes/no fashion. The 
Base Chance for this ritual is 30% (+4/Rank) 
and it has a range of 40 miles + 20 additional 
miles per Rank. The Experience Multiple for 
this ritual is 250. Note: This ritual does not al 
low communication with entities at other 
planes of existence. 

S. Special Knowledge Spells 
College of Rune Magics 

S-l. Runewall Spell 

Base Chance: 50%. 

Range: 15 feet ( + 15/Rank). Duration: Per 
manent until dispelled. Resist: May only be 
actively resisted. Experience Multiple: 250. 
The Adept places a single Runestick incised 
with the warding Rune on the ground and 
performs the spell. If the spell is successful, 
the stick metamorphoses into a translucent 
wall of force 1 inch thick, 10 feet high, and 20 
feet long that may be manually shaped by the 
Adept (and no one else) into any shape of his 
devising (e.g., pillar, circle, dome, etc.). The 
Adept may alter the height or length of the all 
by 1 foot per Rank. Anyone coming into con 
tact with the wall rebounds from it unless they 
successfully resist. Even if they do resist, they 
will be unable to penetrate the wall. In addi 
tion, if the Runestick used to manufacture the 
wall was made of Elder, anyone who fails to re 
sit is thrown to the ground and suffer D10-2 
(+ 1 / Rank with this spell) damage. 

S-2. Spell of Summoning Totem Spirits 
Base Chance: See following text. 

Range: Adept must touch Runestick. 
Duration: Immediate. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 300. There are three 
great Totem Spirits: Athotarho, Tseghi, and 
Argotac. Each is represented by a Rune that 
corresponds to his name. In order to summon 
one of these three evil spirits, the Adept must 
hold in his hand a Runestick incised with the 


37 












Arcane Wisdom 



Rune of the spirit he desires to summon. Only 
one such evil spirit can be summoned per 
spell. As part of the spell, the Adept must cast 
the Runestick to the ground at his feet. The 
Runestick then explodes harmlessly and, in its 
place, the desired spirit appears. The Totem 
Spirits have the following characteristics: 

ATHOTARHO is a small masked hunter with 
a spear. He has no talents or magic to speak of, 
but he is a Rank 10 Ranger specializing in 
woods, a Rank 8 Beast Master specializing in 
Common Land Mammals, a Rank 4 Thief, a 
Rank 5 Assassin, and a Rank 3 Military Scien 
tist. He habitually dresses in animal skins and 
his buttons, fastenings, weapons, etc., are of 
finely carved bone. He refrains from using 
metal weapons if possible, though he suffers 
no special damage from Cold Iron per se. 
Athotarho has a running speed of 250 yards 
per minute. 

PS: 18 MD: 20 AG: 19 MA: 10 EN: 18 
FT: 20 WP: 21 PC: 23 PB: 7 TMR: 6 
NA: Skin absorbs 6 DP 
Weapons: Athotarho has no special weapons, 
but carries a bone short sword, spear, dagger, 
and short bow (with 20 arrows in a quiver) 
upon appearing. He is maximum Rank with 
all these weapons. 

Comments: Athotarho gladly accompanies 
anyone who promises good hunting and fight 
ing, but demands many petty honors and first 
pick of all food (especially freshly-killed ani 
mals) and prisoners (if any). He enslaves any 
prisoners and shabbily uses them until he 
parts company with the Adept. Then, he kills 
his slaves rather than allow them to be freed or 
used by others. If denied first pick of either 
food or captives, Athotarho becomes restive 
and unhappy and seeks to betray whoever he 
considers primarily to blame for denying him 
his due. At the end of each day, there is a 20% 
chance that Athotarho will depart to answer 
the call of some other Adept. This Base 
Chance is decreased by 1 per Rank the Adept 
currently accompanied by Athotarho has with 
this spell. Athotarho immediately disappears 
upon answering another summons and will 
not reappear unless summoned again. 

ARGOTAC appears as an aged priest in rough 
brown robes. He always carries an obsidian 
ceremonial dagger with which he kills any 
prisoners given into his care. His eyes are dark 
and frightening and his skin is pale and clay 
like. Argotac possesses no magic per se. How 
ever, he has the talent of forcing any character 
who looks into his eyes (except for the Adept) 
to roll on the Fright Table (see 44.8 of 
DRAGONQUEST(r) game). Argotac is a Rank 
3 Ranger specializing in Waste; a Rank 8 Beast 

38 


Master, specializing in humans; a Rank 5 As 
sassin; and a Rank 7 Spy. He has a running 
speed of 300 yards per minute.

Weapons: Argotac is not a warrior in the nor 
mal sense, but he uses his dagger in combat 
(Rank 3) and he has Rank 7 in Unarmed Com 
bat. He uses non-metal weapons if required 
and will pick up and use metal weapons in a 
dire emergency, but he normally avoids Cold 
Iron which makes him uncomfortable 
(though it does no special damage). 
Comments: Argotac accompanies and assists 
the Adept in exchange for a promise of a life 
each day. At the end of any day that Argotac 
has not been provided with a prisoner to kill, 
there is a 70% chance that he will depart and 
not return unless summoned by a new spell. 
This Base Chance is decreased by 1 per Rank 
the Adept currently accompanied by Atho 
tarho has with this spell, but is increased by 10 
for each day that Argotac has accompanied 
the Adept since he was last given a life by that 
Adept. There is a 10% chance that Argotac 
will try to kill the Adept or his companions 
prior to departing. 

TSEGHI is a great gray hawk with a 7-foot 
wingspan. He possesses no special skills, tal 
ents, or magic. Tseghi has a flying speed of 
1200 yards per minute.

Weapons: Tseghi can attack in Melee or Close 
Combat with either beak (Base Chance of 
55 % of doing D10 + 1 Damage) or two talons 
(Base Chance of 70% of doing D10 +4 Dam 
age) without penalty in the same pulse. His 
beak is Rank 5 and his talons are Rank 6. 
Comments: Tseghi gladly accompanies the 
Adept and assists him under the same terms as 
Athotarho (except that he sees any captives as 
merely another form of food). There is a Base 
Chance of 20% that Tseghi will depan at the 


end of each day. Once departed, he will not 
return unless again successfully summoned by 
the Adept. The Base Chance that Tseghi will 
depart is decreased by 1 per Rank with this 
spell of the Adept whom Tseghi is accompa 
nying. Tseghi never voluntarily goes under 
ground or indoors. 

Ail three Totem Spirits are manifestations of 
the greater spirit they represent. Thus, for exam 
ple, the Argotac Totem Spirit is only a manifesta 
tion of the greater spirit that is Argotac, an 
ancient evil that has always existed on this plane. 
Accordingly, whenever "Argotac" is sum 
moned, a small part of the consciousness that is 
the greater Argotac becomes manifest in the 
Runestick used to summon him. The implica 
tion here is that there may be a large number of 
Totem Spirits which are but small parts of the to 
tal Argotac consciousness. It is conceivable, 
therefore, that two Adepts could each face off 
against each other, each aided by a part of the 
Argotac super-consciousness in Totem Spirit 
form. In such cases, the individual Totem Spirits 
will not attempt to do injury to each other di- 
recdy. The Base Chance of performing this spell 
successfully depends on the entity being sum 
moned: 

The Adept attempts to summon Tseghi 35 

The Adept attempts to summon Atho 
tarho 30 

The Adept attempts to summon Argotac 25 

Should the spell backfire, the Backfire Ta 
ble is not consulted. Instead, the summoned 
Totem Spirit attacks and attempts to destroy 
the summoner. In addition, the Base Chance 
for this spell is reduced by 5 when attempting 
to summon a Totem Spirit which, upon its 
previous summoning, attacked as a result of a 
backfire. 

S-3. Spell of Creating Rune Portal 
Base Chance: 50%. 

Range: Adept must touch Runestick. 
Duration: Immediate. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 300. 














The Adept must place a Runestick with the 
Portal Rune on it in the ground and touch it 
while casting the spell. Once the spell is suc 
cessfully cast, the Runestick is immovable. It 
becomes the terminus for a future attempt at 
teleportation. Once the terminus has been es 
tablished, the Adept may, at any future time, 
use another Runestick which was carved at the 
same time and is a mate of the Runestick used 
as the terminus to travel back to the original 
terminus. There can only be one "mate" for 
the terminus, and it too must contain the Por 
tal Rune and must be of the same material as 
the terminus Runestick. In order to teleport to 
the terminus, the Adept simply places the 
mate in or on the ground and casts the spell. If 
unsuccessful, both Runesticks are destroyed. 
If successful, the mate of the terminus is acti 
vated and becomes a terminus too. Thereaf 
ter, anyone who touches one terminus is 
teleported to the other terminus and appears 
standing within five feet of that terminus (tra 
vel time is one pulse). A terminus may be used 
any number of times until destroyed, but may 
never be moved. A terminus is destroyed by 
casting a Special Knowledge Counterspell of 
the College of Rune Magics over it. Once a ter 
minus is destroyed, the mate of the Runestick 
used to form the terminus no longer functions 
(though this will not necessarily be known un 
til someone tries to use the mate). If a termi 
nus is destroyed during the pulse while an 
entity is in transit between the two, the entity 
is destroyed and its molecules dispersed over 
known space. 

The Base Chance for this spell is decreased 
by 1 for every 5 miles separating the two 
Runesticks and increased by 15 if the Runes 
ticks are shaped from Willow wood. 

S-4. Spell of Visitation 
Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: 2 miles ( +2/Rank). 

Duration: 5 minutes (+ 5/Rank). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 250. 

The Adept must cast the Runes of Far-seeing 
(three matched Runesticks) on the ground be 
fore him while performing the spell. If suc 
cessful, the Adept is able to send a ghost-like 
image of himself instantly to any location 
within range that the Adept has physically oc 
cupied at least once in the past. He is present 
at that location in all ways except bodily (i.e., 
he may communicate and use all his senses 
while his image is there, but may not be 
harmed by any attack). The image "mimics" 
the actual actions of the Adept, and may 
move no more than 10 feet (+ 10/Rank) from 
the spot where it materialized, which may be 
anywhere at the location the Adept wishes. 


Thus, if the Adept desired his image to 
talk, he must actually speak the words wher 
ever he is physically located. Also, if the 
Adept is in a location which would prevent 
him from moving, the image may not move 
either. When the visitation time has expired 
(or anytime prior that the Adept wishes), the 
image quickly fades and travels back to the 
Adept. This image leaves an "aura" trail 
which, if detected by a Detect Aura talent or 
spell, gives the compass direction at which the 
Adept would be located, but not the distance. 

S-5. Spell of Truth 
Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: 15 feet (+ 15/Rank). 

Duration: 1 hour (+ 1/Rank). 

Resist: May only be passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 300. Prior to casting this 
spell, the Adept must first draw a Truth Rune 
on the forehead (or over the brainpan) of the 
spell's target. The spell may only be cast over 
one target entity of the Adept's choosing and 
the Adept must touch the target to cast it. If 
unsuccessful, a new Truth Rune must be 
drawn on the target before the spell can be at 
tempted again. A successful spell that is not 
successfully resisted causes the target to be un 
able to speak falsehood for the duration of the 
spell and to answer any question put to him. 
In addition, the target can see through any il 
lusion, magical trap or other object, entity or 
apparition which is magical in nature and 
which is within range. The target automati 
cally disbelieves all illusions within range and 
sees the true nature of all things. 

S-6. Spell of Banishment 

Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: Adept must touch target with Rune- 
wand. 

Duration: Immediate. 

Resist: May be actively and passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 300. 

The Adept may banish any one entity from 
another dimension to its own plane of exist 
ence. In order to do so, the Adept must touch 
the target entity with his Runewand at the 
moment he completes the spell. If successful, 
the spell results in the entity immediately re 
turning to its own dimension unless the entity 
successfully resists. Otherwise, the entity re 
mains on this plane. If the entity's next action 
is to attack the Adept, the Base Chance of the 
entity's attack being successful is increased by 
20, and 2 is added to any damage check result 
ing from that attack (in addition to any other 
modifiers to that check). The touch is auto 
matic, but the spell must be prepared nor 
mally. 


S-7. Smite Spell 
Base Chance: 15%. 

Range: Adept must touch target with Rune 
wand. 

Duration: Immediate. 

Resist: May only be passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 300. 

The Adept must touch the target he intends 
to smite with the Runewand at the moment 
the spell is cast. The target may passively resist 
if the spell is successful. If the target fails to re 
sist, he suffers ldl0-3 ( +1/Rank) damage. 
The touch is automatic, but the spell must be 
prepared normally. 

S-8. Spell of Creating Runeweapon 

Base Chance: 20 %. 

Range: Adept must touch Runestick used and 
it must remain in sight. 

Duration: 1 hour (+ 1/Rank). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 400. 

The Adept must use a Runestick incised with a 
Deathrune and with a Rune representing the 
type of Runeweapon he wishes to create. The 
Adept holds the Runestick while casting the 
spell. Upon successfully completing the cast, 
the Runestick transforms into a magical 
weapon of whatever type the Rune incised on 
the Runestick indicated (short sword, dagger, 
glaive, etc.). Since the substance of the 
weapon is magical, the Adept can wield the 
weapon without suffering the penalties associ 
ated with Cold Iron. Further, the weapon is 
useable against those entities normally af 
fected only by magical weapons, but other 
wise has the same properties as a normal 
weapon of the same type. An entity using a 
Runeweapon never drops the weapon and 
there is never any chance of the weapon break 
ing. Additionally, the entity cannot be dis 
armed. The Base Chance of casting this spell is 
increased by 10 if the Runestick used is of El 
der or Yew and is decreased by 20 if the Runes 
tick used is of Walnut or Elm. In addition, if 
Runesticks of Yew are used, and at least one 
point of effective damage is inflicted on a tar 
get, the wound is poisoned, causing ldl0-6 
(+ 1/Rank) damage per pulse for Id 10 pulses 
due to poison. DRAGONQUEST(r) game 
rules: any entity may use a Runeweapon once 
it is created; AD&D(r) game rules: Any 
fighter, thief or Rune Adept may use a 
Runeweapon once it is created. 

S-9. Binding Spell 

Base Chance: 20%. Range: Adept must touch 
element with Runestick. 

Duration: 30 minutes (+ 5/Rank). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 500. 


39 















The Adept may gain control of any element by 
using this spell. He must possess a Runestick 
containing the Binding Rune and the Rune rep 
resenting the element to be bound and he must 
touch the element with that Runestick at the 
moment he casts the spell. The Adept may bind 
500 pounds of earth (+ 500/Rank), 500 gallons 
of water (+ 500/Rank), 1000 cubic feet of air 
(+ 500/Rank), or all fire within a 10-foot radius 
(+15 feet/Rank). He may do anything with the 
element except form an elemental. This spell 
may not be cast over an area occupied by an ele 
mental and cannot be used in any way to control 
an elemental. 

R. Special Knowledge Rituals 
College of Rune Magics 

R-l. Ritual of Casting the Runes 
The Adept must prepare a piece of paper or 
vellum on which are written the Runes of 
Doom. The entire ritual of preparation takes 
an hour. At the end of the hour, the Adept 
chooses which of the demons from the College 
of Greater Summonings will be the executor 
of the doom and writes this name on the paper 
as well. The Adept's player must actually write 
this information down, since it will only come 
into play in the future. Once the ritual is pre 
pared, the Adept then passes the sheet of pa 
per on to the victim whose name is written on 
the paper. The victim must voluntarily accept 
the paper (though he need not know what is 
on it). Once he accepts it, the demon named 
on the paper hunts him down and kills him. 
Even if the demon is destroyed it returns as 
soon as it is able and continue the hunt (see 


College of Greater Summonings for how de 
mons recover from injury and "death" in 
their own dimension). Only by passing the 
paper on to another entity who voluntarily ac 
cepts it can the doom be transferred. If the pa 
per is destroyed, the doom can never be lifted 
or transferred. The Experience Multiple for 
this ritual is 350. Its Base Chance of success is 
5% ( + 5/Rank). If the ritual backfires, the 
Adept loses D10 + 2 Endurance. 

R-2. Ritual of Creeping Doom 
The Adept creates 13 Runesticks by carving the 
appropriate maledictions into human bones. He 
then performs a ritual over them (duration 1 
hour) and buries the sticks beneath the dwelling 
of someone he wishes to curse. It is best if the vic 
tim's name is carved into the bones as well, oth 
erwise others in the house may become ill 
instead. For each month that the bones remain 
in or under the victim's dwelling, he must make 
a Resistance Check, the Base Chance for which is 
composed of the victim's Endurance multiplied 
by the Difficulty Rating of the resistance. At 
Ranks 0-5, the Difficulty Rating is 4; Ranks 6- 
10, the Difficulty Rating is 3; Ranks 11-15, the 
Difficulty Rating is 2.5; Ranks 16-18, the Diffi 
culty Rating is 2; Ranks 19-20, thf Difficulty 
Rating is 1.5. 

If the victim fails to resist, he suffers a wast 
ing disease and loses ldlO - 3 Endurance 
points for the purposes of future resistance 
(only). If he fails to resist for three straight 
months, he dies. The Experience Multiple for 
this ritual is 300. The Base Chance of the rit 
ual working 20% (+ 4/Rank). 

Generally, the victim of these maledictions 
does not know exacdy what is wrong with him. 


Should he discover the bones, he may remove 
the curse by removing the bones from the house. 
Other means of ending a curse do not normally 
suffice, although the sufferer would show imme 
diate improvement upon leaving the house and 
sleeping elsewhere for a few weeks. There is no 
chance of this ritual backfiring. 

R-3. Ritual of Dimension Portal 
The Adept must have the True Name of another 
dimension from a Namer in order to perform 
this ritual. He prepares a Runestick containing 
the Portal Rune and the Rune representing the 
True Name of that other dimension. He then 
takes one hour to prepare the portal, laying the 
Runestick on the ground where he wants the 
portal to appear. At the end of an hour, a check 
is made to determine if the ritual has been suc 
cessful. The Base Chance of success is 20 % (+ 3 / 
Rank). If the ritual succeeds, a portal 
immediately appears leading into the dimension 
represented on the Runestick. Anyone entering 
that portal will be in the other dimension (after a 
travel time of one minute). The portal is a two- 
way terminus, and those in the other dimension 
will be able to cross into this dimension through 
the portal. The portal remains for a number of 
hours equal to 3 plus the rank of the Adept with 
this ritual plus the results of a Id 10 die roll 
(made by the GM). It is destroyed permanendy 
at the end of that time or whenever a Special 
Knowledge Counterspell of the College of Rune 
Magics is cast over the area it occupies. The Expe 
rience Multiple for this ritual is 600. If the ritual 
backfires, an entity native to that dimension 
(GM's choice) enters the Adept's dimension and 
immediately attacks the Adept and his compan 
ions. 


91. The College of Shaping Magics 

The College of Shaping Magics is concerned 
with the fashioning and animation of nonliv 
ing matter, with the construction of enchant 
ments of an enduring nature and, most 
importantly, with the creation of potent magi 
cal items. 

The arts of the College of Shaping Magics 
may require special knowledge, special equip 
ment, the expenditure of money, time and 
Endurance, and the presence of companions. 

Most of the ritual magic of this College may 
only be practiced within a Shaper's workshop, 
a composite of the shops of artisans of many 
different types. Tools used in metallurgy, al 
chemy, blacksmithing, weaving, carpentry, 
the fashioning of gems, and dozens of other 


trades are all found in the shop of a powerful 
Shaper. A Shaper has some knowledge of each 
of these trades, but often hires others to per 
form menial tasks, or those beyond his exper 
tise. The cost of hiring artisans is accounted 
for in the cost of materials for each ritual. 

The cost to establish a Shaper's shop is 
equal to 5,000 Silver Pennies+ (800 x the 
Shapers highest Rank with any ritual requir 
ing a workshop). A Shaper may pay up to 
20% less than the standard cost, in which case 
his shop is "poorly stocked." 

Conversely, a shop is "well-stocked" if a 
Shaper pays at least 1.5 times the standard 
amount. An additional 10% of a shop's cost 
must be expended yearly to pay for mainte 
nance. If this amount is not paid, the value of 
the shop drops by 20% (possibly altering its 
effectiveness). 

A Shaper's shop is ranked and the Rank 


must equal or exceed the highest Rank of any 
of his rituals requiring a shop. A Shaper may 
upgrade his shop at any time that it is not 
"poorly stocked" by spending 10,000 Silver 
Pennies per Rank he wishes to raise the shop. 

Example: A Shaper's highest Rank with any 
ritual is 7. He expends [5,000 +(8,000 x 
7)]xl.5 =91,500 Silver Pennies to buy a well- 
stocked shop. Each year he must pay 9,150 Sil 
ver Pennies or the shop's value degrades to 
73,200 Silver Pennies (and the Shaper loses 
the benefit of a well-stocked shop). A de 
graded poorly-stocked shop may not be used 
for Shaping magics. 

Many materials required for rituals are of 
ten quite expensive or rare. Nevertheless, any 
materials needed for a ritual must be present 
or the ritual may not be performed. 

Most of this College's rituals require a far 
greater investment of time than the rituals of 


40 















other Colleges. Some rituals require only a 
few hours, but most require weeks and even 
years. 

Note that rituals extending for periods of 
24 hours or more do not require the inten 
sive concentration of the rituals of other 
Colleges. The Adept is working and super 
vising the work of others, but is not in 
volved in constant concentration. He may 
eat, sleep (eight hours a day), and perform 
other activities requiring less than two hours 
a day while he is involved in a lengthy rit 
ual. A Shaper may not utilize any magic 
while involved in a ritual (other than that 
inherent in the ritual itself), however. These 
restrictions often mean that a Shaper loses 
practice in his skills or weapons while per 
forming an extended ritual. 

In order to perform certain powerful rit 
uals, a Shaper must permanently reduce his 
Endurance. Whenever Endurance is re 
duced in this way, Fatigue is reduced as well 
(according to the scale given in 5.3 of the 
DRAGONQUEST(r) rules). In rare situa 
tions, a Shaper must permanently sacrifice 
his bodily form and become a Spectre in or 
der to perform a difficult ritual. The Shaper 
may not "heal" this Endurance loss. 

Several rituals require the presence of 
other Adepts or of persons with knowledge 
of particular skills or languages. Such per 
sons must be coerced, bribed, or otherwise 
convinced to help by the Shaper. The usual 
rate of payment for participation in a Shap 
er's project is 400 Silver Pennies multiplied 
by the number of weeks the ritual takes. 
Naturally, the longer the ritual, the more 
difficult it is for a Shaper to find a willing 
assistant. Assisting people must be present 
for at least half of each week of the ritual. 

The following numbers are added to the 
Base Chance of performing any ritual of the 
College of Shaping Magics: 


Ritual is performed in a high-mana 
area +25 

Adept spends at least 50% extra on 
materials + 5 

Adept performs ritual in well-stocked 
workshop + 5 

Adept performs ritual in poorly- 
stocked workshop -15 

Ritual is attempted outside workshop 
(possible only for Q-l, Q-2, Q-3,Q- 
4, and R-l) -20 

Ritual is performed in low-mana area - 40 


T. Talents-College of Shaping Magics 
T-l. Detect Enchantment 
Adepts of this College have the ability to de 
termine whether an item, person, or area 
within 50 feet (+ 10/Rank) is currently under 
an enchantment. This enchantment may be 
an operating spell, a ward, an invested spell, 
or any other magical charm. Magical beings 
(conjured or summoned) may also be detected 
by this Talent. It does not tell the type of en 
chantment, only whether one exists. The Tal 
ent operates automatically with a Base Chance 
of 3xMagic Aptitude ( +3/Rank), but the 
Base Chance rises to 4xMagic Aptitude (+ 3 / 
Rank) if an Adept physically examines 
(touches) the item or place in question. The 
Experience Multiple for this talent is 100. 

G. General Knowledge Spells 
College of Shaping Magics 

G-l. Spell of Mending 

Base Chance: 50%. 

Range: Caster must touch object to be 
mended. 

Duration: Permanent. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 200. 

Any single broken item weighing up to 10 
pounds (+ 10/Rank) may be mended. A frac 
tured item can only be made whole if all 
pieces are present when the spell is cast (if any 
are missing, the repaired object has a hole 
where the missing piece would be). A mended 
object becomes exactly as it was before it was 
broken, so if it was deformed in some way (i.e 
a sword was bent), it remains deformed. 

G-2. Spell of Enchanting Weapons 
Base Chance: 35%. 

Range: 10 feet (+ 5 / Rank). 

Duration: 30 seconds x (ldl0-2) x Rank; xl 
if unranked. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 200. 

Increases the Base Chance to hit with the 
weapon over which it is cast by 1 (+1 / Rank), 
and increases the damage done by the weapon 
by 1 for every 3, or fraction of 3, Ranks. 

G-3. Spell of Enchanting Armor 
Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: 10 feet (+10/Rank). 

Duration: 30 minutes ( +30/Rank). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 200. 

The Strike Chance of any character attempt 
ing to hit a target wearing armor enchanted by 
this spell is reduced 2 / Rank. Enchanted armor 
also absorbs 1 additional point of damage for 


every 4, or fraction of 4, Ranks attained with 
this spell. Note that the spell must be cast on 
armor (never on an unarmored individual). 

G-4. Congeal Air Spell 
Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: 20 feet (+ 10/Rank). 

Duration: 10 seconds (+ 10/Rank). 

Resist: May be actively resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 300. 

This spell thickens the air around one entity, 
slowing its movement and inhibiting its com 
bat abilities. An affected entity loses one- 
third of its TMR, and its Base Chance in form 
of attack is reduced by 10. The spell also di 
verts any blows directed at the affected entity, 
however, so 2 is subtracted from any damage 
inflicted against it. Congealed air may be 
breathed without harm. 

G-5. Congeal Water Spell 

Base Chance: 25%. 

Range: 25 feet (+ 15 /Rank). 

Duration: 1 minute ( + 30 seconds/Rank). 
Resist: May be actively resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 400. 

This spell gives a volume of 50 (+ 10/Rank) 
cubic feet of water a gelatin-like consistency, 
keeping any entities within that volume from 
sinking and making swimming and combat 
impossible. This spell cannot be cast at living 
beings. Water-breathing creatures may 
breathe congealed water. 

Q. General Knowledge Rituals 
College of Shaping Magics 
Q- 1. Ritual of Shaping Rag and String Golem 
This ritual allows a Shaper to form a small go 
lem out of available bits of rag and string. Rag 
and string Golems have the following charac 
teristics: 

Description: Rag and string golems are 1 to 2 
feet tall and humanoid in form. Their skin has 
the color and texture of their component rags. 

Talents, Skills, and Magic: When created, the 
rag and string golem may be imbued with a 
number of abilities by the Shaper and other 
persons present at the shaping. Up to 5x the 
Shaper's Rank with this ritual of Ranks of any 
spells, talents, skills, weapon ability, or lin 
guistic knowledge may be imbued into the 
golem. However, for each individual ability 
bestowed, two is subtracted from the maxi 
mum total. For example, a golem formed by a 
Shaper who is Rank 6 with Q-1 could have 30 
Ranks (5x6) of ability, but minus 2x[the num 
ber of abilities bestowed]. Thus, this golem 
could be a Rank 6 Healer, Rank 0 Spy, Rank 4 
with a dagger, Rank 2 in a language, Rank 3 in 


41 












Arcane Wisdom 



the Spell of Mending, and have Rank 3 with 
the sling, the maximum possible since the 
golem has 6 different abilities [30- 
6x2 = 18]. No ability may be imbued in a 
golem unless the Shaper or some other char 
acter participating in the ritual has Rank in 
the ability at least equal to the Rank im 
bued. A rag and string golem may never 
learn rituals, nor may it ever know spells or 
talents from more than one College. A rag 
and string golem automatically knows its 
Shaper's language at whatever Rank the 
Shaper, himself, knows it, and this ability 
does not count against the total that may be 
imbued in the golem.

* Depends on rags used. 


Weapons: Rag and String golems may use 
any weapons allowed by their strength. 
They may never use armor or shields, how 
ever, and their spell-casting ability is af 
fected by the presence of Cold Iron exactly 
as the ability of a normal Adept. 

Comments: Rag and string golems are by 
far the most intelligent of the golems. They 
can receive and carry out very complicated 
instructions without flaw. They can also 
converse with their masters and any other 
beings with whom they share a language. 
These golems can act freely and modify the 
letter of their orders to follow the intent be 
hind them. Commands can thus be given in 
general terms, and the golems improvise as 
they go along. 

Rag and string golems serve their creator 
(and only their creator) faithfully. At their 
creator's request, they will serve others (but 
for only less than a day). 

This ritual may be performed (with pen 
alty) outside of a Shaper's workshop, but 
takes two hours to perform regardless of lo 
cation. The spell of Animating Golems (S- 
5) must be cast over the golem immediately 
following its creation, or it falls apart. Once 
created, this golem lasts until it is killed 


(zero Endurance), or until the Special 
Knowledge Counterspell of Shaping Magics 
is cast over it. 

The Base Chance for this ritual is 40% 
(+2/Rank), and the Experience Multiple is 
250. There is no backfire. 

Q-2. Ritual of Shaping Clay Golem 
A Shaper may use this ritual to shape clay 
into the form of a golem. Clay must be 
available for the ritual to be performed. 
Clay golems have the following characteris 
tics: 

Description: Clay golems are humanoid 
and between 4 and 8 feet tall. The golem is 
the color of the clay from which it is formed. 

Talents, Skills, and Magic: Clay golems 
have no talents, skills, or magical abilities. 

Movement (Running): 100 
PS: 5-15 plus (2xRank) 

MD: 6-10 
AG: 4-8 
MA: 0 

EN: 14-20 plus Rank 
FT: 15-30 plus Rank 














WP: 19 
PC: 10 
PB: 8 
TMR: 2 
NA: None 

The larger the golem, the greater the Physical 
Strength, Endurance, and Fatigue, but the 
lower the Manual Dexterity and Agility 
(within the ranges provided). 

Weapons: Clay golems may use any weapon 
they are physically capable of using (see PS 
and MD requirements on Weapons Chart), al 
though they may never have Rank with a 
weapon. They may attack with their hands in 
Close or Melee combat with a Base Chance of 
40% of doing ldl0 + 7 damage. 

Comments: Clay golems are mindless. They 
can follow simple commands (e.g., "Attack 
him," "Carry these boulders to the top of the 
hill"), but can do nothing complex. They fol 
low only the commands of their Shaper. 

A minimum of one hour must be spent 
shaping a clay golem. This ritual can be per 
formed anywhere, although its Base Chance 
suffers an unfavorable modification if it is per 
formed outside a Shaper's workshop. Once 
shaped, a clay golem must be animated before 
its clay dries out, or it is useless. Once ani 
mated, a clay golem remains active for 
5 + Rank (with Q-2) hours. Clay golems may 
never be reanimated. The clay of which they 
are composed may be reshaped, however. 

The Base Chance for this ritual is 25% 

( +3/Rank), and the Experience Multiple is 
300. There is no backfire. 

Q-3. Ritual of Magic Divination 

This ritual is identical to the ritual of the same 

name of the College of Naming Incantations. 

Q-4. Ritual of Investment 

This ritual is identical to the Investment Rit 
ual described in the DRAGONQUEST(r) rules 
(32.3), except that its Base Chance is 2xMA 
(instead of lxMA), and its Experience Multi 
ple is 250, not 300. 

The Preparation Rituals 

Rituals Q-5 through Q-ll are all preparation 
rituals. These rituals can be used to prepare 
specific types of objects with enchantments of 
various sorts. Once a preparation ritual has 
been successfully completed, the Shaper must 
then perform the appropriate Bind Rituals (R- 
9 to R-22) to complete the item's enchant 
ment. 

When an item is prepared by one of the fol 
lowing rituals, it is imbued with specific 


spells, talents, skills, weapon abilities or lan 
guage knowledge. Any number of them may 
be imbued by one ritual. For example, a ring 
might be imbued with the spells "Armor of 
Earth," "Navigation," and "Shadow-Form," 
plus the talent "Detect Aura," Rank 4 in the 
Mechanician Skill, Rank 3 with the broad 
sword, and Rank 7 in written Elvish. Ritual 
knowledge may never be bestowed on an 
item, however. Once a shaper has decided 
what abilities will be contained within a given 
item, that item's Shaping Index can be found, 
and the Shaper can determine from that Index 
several important parameters relating to the 
item's construction: how long it will take to 
prepare the item; how much its production 
will cost; and whether the Shaper must lose 
any Endurance to produce the item. 

An item's Shaping Index is determined by 
adding one value for each ability to be be 
stowed upon an item. The value for each type 
of ability is determined differently, as de 
scribed in the following: 

Spells and Talents with Experience Multi 
ples: Add the ability's Experience Multiple to 
the Shaping Index. 

Talents without Experience Multiples: Add 
50 to the Shaping Index. 

Skills: Divide the amount of experience 
needed to rise to the Rank (from the next 
lower Rank only) of the bestowed skill by 10. 
Add 100. 

Languages: Divide the amount of experience 
needed to rise to the Rank (from the next lower 
rank only) of the bestowed language by 10. 

Weapon Ability: Total the amount of all ex 
perience needed to attain the Rank with the 
weapon and divide by 5. Note that this is dif 
ferent from the previous two categories. 

Characteristics: Total the amount of experi 
ence needed to attain the amount of point 
gain, assuming every first point costs as indi 
cated and every second follows appropriately. 
Divde the total by 10. 

The time required to prepare an item is 
found as follows: The row on the Magic Item 
Creation Table (91.2) corresponding to the 
items Shaping Index is found. This row is 
cross-referenced with the "Time" column of 
the Table to find the time needed for the 
preparation ritual. 

The cost (in Silver Pennies) to prepare an 
item is found by multiplying the item's nor 
mal cost (its price if it were not enchanted) by 
the number in the "Cost" column of the 
Magic Item Creation Table corresponding to 
the row representing the item's Shaping In 
dex. This number is then multiplied by the 
"Cost Factor" listed in the preparation ritual 
used to find the total cost of that ritual. 

The row of the Magic Item Creation Table 


corresponding to the item's Shaping Index is 
also used to determine if the Shaper must lose 
any Endurance in the course of the prepara 
tion ritual. Any Endurance loss indicated on 
the Table must be permanently expended to 
perform the preparation ritual. The Endur 
ance loss is divided evenly through the length 
of time spent on the ritual. Thus if an item 
takes one year to produce and 7 points of En 
durance must be lost in its production, one 
point would be lost on the 52d, 104th, 156th, 
208th, 260th, 312th and 364th days. Any En 
durance expended is permanently lost, re 
gardless of whether the ritual is eventually 
successful. Note that, in rituals extending to 
five years or more, a Shaper must expend a 
minimum of 20 Endurance Points, and be 
comes a spectre regardless of the success of the 
binding rituals completing the item's en 
chantment. Only the Shaper who prepares an 
item may perform a binding over that item. 

An item may be imbued with a number of 
attributes equal to or less than the Rank with 
the applicable ritual of the Shaper creating 
the item. An Adept capable of casting each of 
the spells and possessing each of the talents to 
go into an item must be present for at least 
half the time spent on that item's preparation 
ritual. Thus, at least three Adepts would have 
to participate in the preparation ritual of an 
item endowed with spells from the College of 
Fire Magics and Naming Magics: a Fire mage, 
a Namer, and the Shaper himself. In the same 
way, any skill, weapon knowledge, or lan 
guage ability must be known by some charac 
ter participating in the item's preparation 
ritual for that ability to be bestowed upon the 
item. An ability can never be bestowed on an 
item with a higher Rank than that of the con 
tributing character (e.g., if an item were to be 
bestowed with Rank 4 ability in the Healer 
skill, some character participating in the ritual 
would have to have at least Rank 4 in that 
skill). A character need not be an Adept to 
contribute nonmagical abilities to an item. 
Each character contributing to an item must 
be present for at least 50% of the item's prep 
aration ritual, regardless of the number of 
abilities he contributes to the item. 

The effect of having an item bestowed with 
a particular ability is to allow the item's 
wielder to use any ability as a talent, without 
the necessity of any extraordinary effort or ex 
penditure of Fatigue. An item enchanted with 
any spell or talent allows the wielder of the 
item to use that item as if it was permanently 
invested (see 32.2) with the spell(s) or tal 
ents). Enchanted weapon Rank gives an 
item's wielder the ability to use a weapon at a 
Rank equivalent to that which the item was 


43 











Arcane Wisdom 



enchanted, plus any Rank he might have him 
self. Thus a character who himself has Rank 5 
with the Rapier would be considered to have 
Rank 13 if he was wearing a ring bestowed 
with Rank 8 with the rapier. 

The ability in a skill or language bestowed 
on an item is not added to the wielder's own 
ability. Rather, the higher of the two Ranks in 
an ability is available to the wielder. For exam 
ple, if a character has Rank 7 in Spy skill, and 
he wears a ring with Rank 9 in that skill, the 
character would be treated as if he had Rank 9, 
not Rank 16. 

Only those spells designed to affect the 
wielder of some facet of his own person may 
be imbued into an object by preparation and 
binding rituals. All other spells must use the 
investment rituals. Investment rituals may be 
performed on already enchanted items. This is 
designed to prevent "kill" spells, such as the 
Bolt of Fire from the College of Fire Magics, 
from freely being placed into items. 

New enchantments may be added to al 
ready enchanted items. A new preparation rit 
ual is undergone (with already bound abilities 
not being factored into the Shaping Index). 
However, one roll on the Shaping Accidents 
Table must be made for each new enchant 
ment added to an already enchanted item, in 
addition to the normal checks for shaping ac 
cidents (see following). Note, however, that 
invested spells are considered a different form 
of enchantment altogether, and do not re 
quire a roll for shaping accidents, even when 
added to an already enchanted item. 

All spells and talents imbued in an item 
function at the Rank of the Adept who pro 
vided the spell during the preparation ritual; 
e.g., if an Adept with Rank 6 in Witchsight 
provided that spell during an item's enchant 
ment, the Witchsight provided by that item 
to the wielder would have a range of 103 
feet-15 + (15x6)-per that spell at Rank 6. 

Preparation rituals all have a Base Chance 
of 90 (+ 1/Rank). This Base Chance may be 
modified per 91-2, but modified Base 
Chances in excess of 99 are treated as 99. Cast 
Checks for preparation rituals are not made at 
the end of the ritual, however, but at the end 
of each week during the course of an item's 
preparation. If the Cast Chance is missed at 
any point, the ritual does not necessarily fail 
entirely. Instead, the GM rolls on the Shaping 
Accidents Table (91.4) to find the results of 
the failed Cast Check. 

Q-5. Ritual of Amulet Preparation 
This ritual allows the Shaper to use amulets as 
receptacles for various abilities. The wearer of 
the amulet is considered the wielder of the 
item. Amulets are primarily used for defen 

44 


sively oriented spells, and may not be imbued 
with abilities that are offensive. The Experi 
ence Multiple for this ritual is 100, and its 
Cost Factor is 25. 

Q-6. Ritual of Preparing Arms and Armor 
This ritual allows the Shaper to prepare arms 
and armor as magical receptacles. The person 
carrying or wearing the item receives the bene 
fits of its enchantment. Weapons enchanted 
in this method break only when the wielder 
rolls above 5xMD, and drop only when the 
wielder rolls above 4xMD. The Experience 
Multiple for this ritual is 200, and the Cost 
Factor is 30. 

Q-7. Ritual of Preparing Enchanted Clothing 
The Shaper may use this ritual to prepare 
clothing with enchantments. The wearer of 
the clothing is considered its wielder. The Ex 
perience Multiple for this ritual is 175, and its 
Cost Factor is 20. 

Q-8. Ritual of Preparing Enchanted Furniture 
Any type of furniture may be magically en 
dowed by this ritual. The GM will have to decide 
who is considered the wielder of the enchanted 
furniture. A magical chair, for example, would 
endow the benefits to the one who sits in it, but 
a magical bookcase or desk is more difficult to 
determine. The Experience Multiple for this rit 
ual is 100 and the Cost Factor is 20. 

Q-9. Ritual of Preparing Talismans and Other 
Minor Artifacts 

This ritual works on small items, such as statu 
ettes, lockets, pens, and paperweights. The 
GM will have to decide exactly how these 
items are used. The Experience Multiple for 
this ritual is 200, and the Cost Factor is 30. 

Q-10. Ritual of Preparing Staves and Wands 

Wizards's staves and magical wands (other 
than Runewands) may be enchanted by this 
ritual. A person must actually hold a staff or 
wand to receive the benefits of its enchant 
ment. The Experience Multiple for this ritual 
is 150, and the Cost Factor is 50. 

Q-ll. Ritual of Preparing Greater Artifacts 

Large objects (such as towers, rooms, or 
arches) may be enchanted by this ritual. En 
chantments bestowed upon such artifacts usu 
ally affect large areas (for example, the 
interior of a room), bestowing their effects 
upon all in the area. Thus, only abilities that 
could affect an area and more than one entity 
can be enchanted into a greater artifact. The 
Experience Multiple for this ritual is 100, and 
the Cost Factor is 5. This is not a Ward. 


S. Special Knowledge Spells 
College of Shaping Magics 

S-l. Spell of Creating Mudslick 
Base Chance: 30%. 

Range: 30 feet (+ 15/Rank). 

Duration: 30 seconds (+ 10/Rank). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 350. 

An area 20 ( +10/Rank) feet square becomes 
slick with a 1 / 4-inch film of mud. Every entity 
within the affected area must roll less than or 
equal to twice its Agility on D100, or it falls. If 
an entity does fall, a roll of less than its Agility 
must be made before it can rise again. 

S-2. Spell of Shaping Elements 
Base Chance: 10%. 

Range: 30 feet (+10/Rank). 

Duration: 5 minutes (+ 1/Rank). 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 400. 

A volume equal to two cubic feet x Rank con 
taining one of the four elements may be 
shaped by the Adept into any form desired, 
and it retains that form for the duration of the 
spell. Thus, a sail of air could be created that 
could propel a boat, or a spear of fire which 
could actually be thrown (although it would 
burn the hand of the thrower). Note that the 
spell cannot be cast over any living entity or 
over an Elemental. 

S-3. Spell of Neutralizing Golems 

Base Chance: 20 %. 

Range: 10 feet (+ 5/Rank). 

Duration: Immediate (during pulse). 

Resist: May be actively and passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 350. 

If this spell is successful, any one magically an 
imated golem is deactivated (i.e., becomes a 
lifeless statue). Deactivated golems, can, in 
most cases, be reanimated via the Spell of Ac 
tivating Golems (S-5). 

S-4. Spell of Binding Golems 

Base Chance: 15 %. 

Range: 15 feet (+ 5 /Rank). 

Duration: 10 minutes ( +5/Rank). 

Resist: May be actively and passively resisted. 
Experience Multiple: 400. 

Any uncontrolled golem may be controlled by 
the casting Adept if the spell is successful. See 
the descriptions of golems to determine the 
nature of commands that may be given spe 
cific golems. 















S-5. Spell of Activating Golems 
Base Chance: 15 %. 

Range: 10 feet. 

Duration: Depends on type of golem. 

Resist: May not be resisted. 

Experience Multiple: 450. 

This spell animates golems that have been 
prepared via Q-l, Q-2, R-2, R-3, or R-4, but 
are not already animated. Once a golem has 
been activated, the caster must immediately 
roll less than 2x(Willpower+ Rank) to gain 
control of the golem. If the roll is not made, 
the golem is uncontrolled, and its actions 
must be determined by the GM (it probably 
attacks everything around it). If this spell 
backfires, there is a 40% chance that the go 
lem being acivated is destroyed, in addition to 
any other backfire results. 

R. Special Knowledge Rituals 
College of Shaping Magics 

R-l. Ritual of Turning Stone to Flesh 
This ritual allows the Adept to turn one entity 
that has been turned to stone by enchanted 
creatures or magical means back into flesh. 
Only entities that are naturally living but have 
been turned to stone are affected by this rit 
ual. Any clothing or other items that were 
turned to stone with a figure are restored to 
their normal state with that figure. The Base 
Chance of this ritual is 55% (+ 3 /Rank), and 
the Experience Multiple is 200. 

R-2. Ritual of Shaping Stone Golems 
A Shaper may use this ritual to craft a golem 
of stone. The crafting requires a minimum of 
three months, and the use of a shop worth at 
least 40,000 Silver Pennies. The materials 
needed for this ritual cost 15,000 Silver Pen 
nies. The golem is carved from a solid block of 
stone. Stone golems have the following char 
acteristics: 

Description: Stone golems are humanoid fig 
ures, 8 to 12 feet tall. Their bodies are the 
color and texture of the stone from which they 
are carved. 

Talents, Skills, and Magic: A stone golem has 

no talents, skills, or magical abilities.

WP: 30 

PC: 7-12 


PB: 6-10 
TMR: 2 

NA: 5-7, depending on hardness of stone used. 

The larger the golem, the lower the Manual 
Dexterity and Agility within the spans given. 
Only magical weapons can harm stone golems 
and any weapon that strikes a stone golem 
must be checked for breakage per normal 
breakage chance. Only magic that affects 
stone can have any effect on stone golems. 

Weapons: Stone golems may use any weap 
ons, but they never have any Rank. They may 
attack with their hands in Melee Combat with 
a Base Chance equal to their (Shaper's 
Rankx4%), or in Close Combat with a Base 
Chance of (50 + Rank)%, doing (ldl0~ 
3) + Rank damage either way. 

Comments: Stone golems are basically mind 
less automatons, and can perform only simple 
tasks. Stone golems remain unanimated after 
their formation until the Spell of Animating 
Golems (S-5) is cast over them. They remain 
unanimated following their creation for any 
length of time without harmful effect. Once 
animated, a stone golem remains active for 3 
hours (+ 30 minutes /Rank in R-2). At the end 
of this time, the golem becomes a stone 


statue. It may be reanimated by S-5 any num 
ber of times, until it is destroyed (i.e. until the 
Special Knowledge Counterspell of Shaping 
Magics is cast over it, or until its Endurance is 
exhausted). 

This ritual is automatic, but each week dur 
ing the golem's construction there is a 1% 
chance of a shaping accident. If such an acci 
dent does occur, the GM should roll on the 
Shaping Accidents Table (91-4) to determine 
the effect. 

R-3. Ritual of Shaping Iron Golems 
A Shaper may use this ritual to cast a golem 
from iron. The casting requires a minimum of 
four months, and the use of a shop worth at 
least 50,000 Silver Pennies. The materials and 
laborers needed in the construction of a golem 
of this type cost 20,000 Silver Pennies. Iron 
golems have the following characteristics: 

Description: Iron golems are humanoid fig 
ures of iron, standing between 6 and 10 feet 
tall. Gemstones are often used for their eyes. 
Weapons are often built into the arms of these 
golems as living parts of their bodies. 

Talents, Skills, and Magic: Iron golems have a 
Rank 5 with any weapon built into them. 
Only magical weapons and spells affecting 


45 












metal can harm iron golems, and any weapons 
that strike them must be checked for break 
age.

WP: 40

PB: 8 

TMR: 3 

NA: 8 

The larger the golem, the lower the Manual 
Dexterity and Agility within the ranges given. 

Weapons: An iron golem may carry any 
weapon, but it only gains the bonus of Rank 5 
with weapons with which it is cast. Such weap 
ons can break, but they can never be dropped. 
Iron golems may use shields but can never 
wear armor. They may attack with their hands 
in Melee Combat with a base Chance equal to 
their (40 +Shaper's Rank)%, or in Close 
Combat with a Base Chance of (55+Sha- 
per'sRank)%, doing (ldlO + Shaper's Rank) 
damage either way. 

Comments: Iron golems are mindless, killing 
automatons. They can perform only very sim 
ple commands, but become deadly fighters 
once in combat. Iron golems can never be 
stunned. 

Once shaped, an iron golem is animated 
until the Spell of Animating Golems (S-5) is 
cast over it. They remain unanimated follow 
ing their creation for any length of time with 
out harmful effect. Once animated, an iron 
golem remains active for 1 hour ( + 15 
minutes/Rank in R-3). After this time, the 
golem reverts to an iron statue. It may be rean 
imated by S-5 any number of times, until it is 
destroyed (i.e. until the Special Knowledge 
Counterspell of Shaping Magics is cast over it, 
or until its Endurance is exhausted). 

This ritual is automatic, but each week dur 
ing the iron golem's casting there is a 1% 
chance of a shaping accident. If such an acci 
dent does occur, the GM should roll on the 
Shaping Accidents Table (91.4) to determine 
the effect. 

R-4. Ritual of Shaping Flesh Golems 
This ritual may be used to form a golem from 
the parts of different corpses. The crafting re 
quires at least six months, and all the pieces 
that are to go into the golem must be found 

46 


before the ritual can begin. A workshop cost 
ing at least 80,000 Silver Pennies must be 
available in order to fashion this creature. In 
addition to pieces of corpses, materials costing 
20,000 Silver Pennies are needed for this rit 
ual. An alchemist of at least Rank 8 must also 
be present throughout the ritual, the cost of 
whose hiring has not been included in the cost 
of materials. Flesh golems have the following 
characteristics: 

Description: A flesh golem may be put to 
gether from different creatures within a spe 
cies, or from any number of different species. 
For example, a troll could be fashioned with 
the brain of a human and the wings of a gar 
goyle; or an ogre could be made with the 
Physical Strength of one ogre (presumably a 
powerful one), the Endurance of another 
hardy one, and the brain of a bright ogre. 
Seams show wherever parts are sewn together 
and all flesh golems exude a horrible rotting 
odor. 

Talents, Skills, and Magic: Flesh golems never 
retain any of the skills or spell-casting ability 
of the creatures from which they are made, 
but do retain any talent appropriate to the 
parts of the creature used. Thus a golem made 
with the eyes of a basilisk would be able to 
turn creatures to stone in the same manner as a 
normal basilisk. 

Movement Rates: Variable, according to the 
golem's size and method(s) of locomotion. 
PS: Average the Physical Strength of the crea 
tures from which the golem's muscle tissues 
were taken. 

MD: Average the Manual Dexterity of the 
creatures from which the golem's muscles and 
brain were taken. 

AG: Average the Agility of the creatures from 
which the golem's muscles and brain were 
taken. 

MA: None. 

EN: Average the Endurance of the creatures 
from which the golem's muscles and internal 
organs were taken. 

FT: As for Endurance, but the creature from 
which the golem's lungs were taken counts 
twice within the average. 

WP: Add 10 to the Willpower of the creature 
from which the golem's brain was taken. 

PC: Variable, depending on the quality of the 
eyes, ears, and mental abilities of the creatures 
that were used. 

PB: Variable, but never more than 6. 

TMR: Variable (depends on Agility, per 5.6 of 
the DRAGONQUEST(r) rules, and on the 
GM's discretion). 

NA: Depends on the creatures from which the 


golem's skin was taken. 

Weapons: A flesh golem may use any natural 
weapons (such as claws or fangs) built into it, 
as well as any weapons that it can carry. Flesh 
golems have Rank in weapons equal to the 
Rank in weapons of the creature whose pri 
mary arm was used to construct the golem's 
primary arm. If a flesh golem has no primary 
arm, it may not have Rank in weapons. 

Comments: The GM has to use discretion in 
allowing combinations of creatures. It would 
be absurd to allow a golem to be built with a 
dragon's head on the body of a wolf, or even 
on the body of a human-due to discrepan 
cies in size, for instance. Flesh golems can be 
harmed by any sort of weapon or magic. Flesh 
golems need not be animated immediately 
following their creation, but each day that 
goes by before they are animated lowers the 
Base Chance of the Spell of Animating Go 
lems (S-5) by 3. Once animated, a flesh golem 
will remain active until it is killed or dispelled 
(by the Special Knowledge Counterspell of 
Shaping Magics cast as a ritual). A flesh golem 
almost always (99%) obeys its creator, but the 
GM must determine the complexity of com 
mands it is capable of executing based on the 
intelligence of the brain used to fashion the 
golem. The Experience Multiple for this ritual 
is 500. The ritual is automatic, but there is a 
1% chance that an accident will occur each 
week during a flesh golem's creation. Roll on 
the Shaping Accidents Table (91.9) to deter 
mine the effects of an accident. 

R-5. Ritual of Warding Demons 
A Shaper may use this ritual to produce the 
shields described in Section 47 (the 
College of Greater Summonings) of the 
DRAGONQUEST rules. The Shaper's cost in 
Silver Pennies for materials, the amount of

A Shaper must be assisted for one week out 
of each month by an Adept of the College of 
Greater Summonings who knows the ritual of 
summoning demons of the type the shield be 
ing manufactured wards against. 












Any Adept may construct as many as Rank / 
3 (round up) shields of any one type simulta 
neously, so long as the materials for each are 
paid for at the rates described above. 

The Experience Multiple for this ritual is 
400. The ritual is automatic, but there is a 1 % 
chance an accident will occur each week dur 
ing the shield's creation. An accident results 
in a random demon (GM's discretion) being 
summoned to the Shaper's shop, the results of 
which are to be determined by the GM. 

R-6. Ritual of Binding Investments 
This ritual allows a Shaper to greatly increase 
the potency of the investment ritual, allowing 
an invested spell to be used an unlimited 
number of times. Thus if the Spell of Malig 
nant Flames was invested in an object by the 
normal investment ritual, and R-6 was suc 
cessfully cast over the object, the Spell of Ma 
lignant Flames could be cast from the item an 
unlimited number of times. Anyone using the 
item would still have to check to see if the 
spell goes off successfully each time it is used. 
The Base Chance for this ritual is 5 % (+ 3 / 
Rank), and the Experience Multiple is 500. A 
backfire while casting this spell results in the 
invested spell affecting the Shaper and any 
other Adepts who may be present. 

R-7. Ritual of Containing Monsters 
This ritual allows an Adept to contain within a 
receptacle any being except those listed in the 
College of Greater Summoning. The recepta 
cle must first be prepared via Q-5, Q-6, Q-7, 
Q-8, Q-9, Q-10, or Q-ll. The Shaping Index 
for a containment is 1200. Containment may 
be performed in conjunction with the be 
stowal of other abilities in an item without 
penalty. After an item has been prepared, the 
ritual is performed over it. The being to be 
contained must be present throughout the rit 
ual, which it may both actively and passively 
resist. If the ritual is successful, the entity is 
contained within the item. If the ritual is un 
successful, there is a 20% chance that the pre 
pared receptacle has been ruined and may not 
be used for the containment. Otherwise, the 
ritual may be repeated. Essentially, the con 
tained entity disappears from this plane. It 
may be released upon command of the 
wielder without question or regard for its own 
safety. The item's wielder may return a crea 
ture to the item by touching the item to the 
creature. An Adept of the College of Lesser 
Summonings must be present for 50% of the 
time of the preparation of the containing ob 
ject (this college will be explained in detail in 
a future DQ product). The Shaping Index for 
this form of containment is 1800. The Base 
Chance for this ritual is 35 % (+ 3/Rank), and 


the Experience Multiple is 350. 

R-8. Ritual of Containing Greater Summon 
ing 

This is a much more subtle version of R-7. It is 
performed in the same way, and has exactly the 
same effects, save that it operates on the crea 
tures listed in the College of Greater Summon 
ings (section 47) of the DRAGONQUEST(r) 
rules. A member of the College of Greater Sum 
monings must be present throughout half of the 
ritual of preparing the containing item. The 
Shaping Index for this form of containment is 
1800. 

A demon must be bound before it can be 
contained within an item, and even then it 
may both actively and passively resist. Other 
creatures (such as devils and incubi) need not 
be bound, but they also have a chance to re 
sist. Even once contained in an item, Greater 
Creatures often influence the item's wielder, 
making the item seem to have a will of its 
own. The item sometimes resists movement or 
becomes heavy, or makes the wielder attack 
some of his friends, or causes him to cast a 
wrong spell as if it has some enchantment in 
addition to the containment. In cases where 
the being contained in an item continues to 
resist in this manner, resistance is only effec 
tive if the Willpower of the individual wield 
ing the item is less than or equal to the 
Willpower of the entity contained in the item. 
The Base Chance that an entity resists in a 
given situation is equal to 3xWillpower. The 
Base Chance for this ritual is 35% ( + 2/ 
Rank), and the Experience Multiple is 500. 

The Enchantment Binding 
Rituals 

Following the completion of one of the Prepa 
ration Rituals (Q-5 through Q-ll), an item 
has been prepared with certain abilities. Each 
ability with which an item was imbued must 
be bound into the item before that ability can 
be used. Only the Adept who performed the 
Preparation Ritual for an item may perform a 
Binding Ritual upon that item. An ability 
need not be bound into an item immediately 
following a Preparation Ritual, but the item 
cannot be used until the abilities contained 
within are bound. 

Spells and magical talents may only be 
bound by the Binding Ritual pertaining to 
their College, while any other abilities may be 
bound by R-22. Each ability of any sort must 
be bound individually, however, even if more 
than one ability bestowed on an item is from 
the same College. If a particular Binding Rit 
ual does not succeed, but the ability to be 


bound is not lost, the Shaper may repeat the 
ritual and attempt to bind it again immedi 
ately after or at a later date. A Shaper may 
thus repeat the various Binding Rituals until 
all abilities capable of being bound within a 
prepared item have either been bound into it 
or lost. Each of the following Binding Rituals 
has a Base Chance of 50% (+ 2 / Rank) and an 
Experience Multiple of 250. 

R-9: Ritual of Binding Shaping Magics; 

R-10: Ritual of Binding Ensorcelments and 
Enchantments;

R-12: Ritual of Binding Naming Magic;

ings; 

R-20: Ritual of Binding Spells of Lesser Sum 
monings; 

R-21: Ritual of Binding Rune Magics; 

R-22: Ritual of Binding Non-Magical Abili 
ties. 

R-23. Ritual of Naming Artifacts 
This allows a Shaper, working with a Namer 
(who must be present during the entire rit 
ual), to imbue an enchanted item with an In 
dividual True Name. This works as a Ward, 
preventing usage of the item unless the 
wielder utters the True Name before each and 
every activation. Activation is defined as the 
use of the item in such a manner that its magi 
cal properties are called into play. Unlike a 
Ward, this magic cannot be dispelled by a 
Namer. The only way in which the Name may 
be taken away or changed is for the individual 
Shaper and Namer to perform the ritual suc 
cessfully again over the item (and at the same 
phase of the moon as the original ritual); then 
they may rename or unname the item as they 
wish. This individual True Name becomes 
known to the Naming Demons, as do all Indi 
vidual True Names. The Shaper or Namer can 
not be forced to reveal the Name by any 
means. The ritual takes one hour to perform, 
and a diamond worth 5,000 Silver Pennies 
must be crushed during the ritual. The Base 
Chance is 50% ( + 5/Rank), and the Experi 
ence Multiple for the ritual is 100. 


47 













R-24. Ritual of Warding Artifacts by Magical 
Aptitude 

This works as Ward R-23, except that Magical 
Aptitude is imbued into the item to prevent 
unwanted use. An Adept must be present 
with a Magical Aptitude at least equal to or 
greater than the Magical Aptitude desired. 
This may be the Shaper himself. As the ritual 
is performed, a Ward is imbued such that any 
entity whose Magical Aptitude is less than 
that imbued attempting to activate the item 
cannot use it, and in fact takes [(ldlO - 
4) + Shaper's Rank] points of damage directly 
to Endurance if the entity tries. The ritual 
takes three hours to perform, and a rubellite 
tourmaline worth 500 Silver Pennies must be 
crushed during the ritual. The Base Chance is 
2xShaper's MA ( + 3/Rank), and the Experi 
ence Multiple is 150. 

R-25. Ritual of Ancient Divination 
Through this ritual, an Adept may discover 
what magic has been placed in an object 
which, because of the amount of time since 
enchantment, is beyond the capabilities of 


Q-3. The ritual requires a stocked workshop 
worth at least 30,000 Silver Pennies and a 
Crystal of Vision from the College of Ensorcel- 
ments and Enchantments worth 4,000 Silver 
Pennies (this crystal is reusable). The Base 
Chance to determine the exact nature of each 
separate enchantment is the Adept's Magic 
Aptitudex2 ( + 5/Rank). Five is subtracted for 
each decade since the item was enchanted. 
Each enchantment is revealed individually, 
and therefore an item which had six different 
enchantments placed on it would need at least 
six distinct rituals, which may have different 
Cast Chances (due to the possibly differing 
ages of each enchantment). The ritual takes 
six hours, and if the ritual backfires, the Crys 
tal of Vision is destroyed, and the Adept suf 
fers Endurance damage equal to the 
Endurance cost (if any) to shape the item. The 
Experience Multiple is 450.
