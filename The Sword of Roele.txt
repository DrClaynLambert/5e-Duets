introduction 

T he Sword of Roele is a Birthright"' 
adventure designed for 3-6 player 
characters (PCs) of levels 5-8 
(about 30 total levels). One of the PCs 
should be a regent in Anuire or Khinasi, 
and-because of the large numbers of 
undead encountered-a priest character is 
required to successfully complete the 
adventure. Because of the adventure's 
many traps, a thief character is indispens 
able. The action takes place in the lands 
between Anuire and the Khinasi, near 
Coeranys. Elinie, Osoerde, Baruk-Azhik, 
the Rohrmarch, the Harrowmarsh (the 
Hydra's swamp), Sendoure, and Binsada.

background 

T he Sword of Roele involves three 
major sets of characters in addition 
to the PCs; the Chimera, the Three 
Brother Mages, and the Monkey King. 

The Chimera is too powerful for 5th to 
8th level parties to defeat. Her role is as a 
patron, bribing and cajoling the PCs into 
solving her problem in the adventure. 

The Three Brother Mages are the 
Chimera's opponents, but not necessarily 
the PCs' allies. If the PCs approach them 
diplomatically, the Brothers might become 
allies, but they might just as easily become 
enemies-it's up to the PCs, The Three 
Brother Mages seek to defeat the Chimera 
and use her sources, but only as a means 
to a larger end. 

The Monkey King is an animal ford 
with a flair for mischief. He drags the PCs 
into a political mess, but those who prove 
themselves worthy will be richly rewarded. 


the madness of 
the chimera 

M any years ago, the Chimera 
found immortality. Ever since, 
she has been slowly consumed 
bv madness. Her madness affects the 
action. She believes she is destined to 
assume the Iron Throne, and she tries to 
use the PCs to get there. 

The Chimera likes to flaunt her power 
over death by asking her few visitors to 
answer one question truthfully: "Do you 
want to live forever?" Of course, no matter 
the answer, she simply laughs, since she 
has no intention of sharing her secret. She 
expects to hear "Yes'*-those who say 
"No" must explain themselves. 

The Chimera believes that the Three 
Brothers are after earthly power. She 
thinks (incorrectly) they are searching for 
the resting place of the Sword of Roele, the 
blade that Michael Roele used when he 
fought the Gorgon. In fact, the sword is 
one of the Gorgon's favorite trophies and 
is kept deep within his realm s most secure 
treasuries-so deep, that most of the out 
side world has forgotten its true location. 
Though the Monkey King stole it, the 
Three Brothers don't think it is nearby. 
Even the Gorgon doesn't immediately 
notice its loss. 

the three 
brother ma<rcs ~ 

f|"^ he Chimera has allowed the 
Three Brother Mages to tap 
-M_ her sources and yet live 
because she is curious about 
them. Of all the people she has 
ever met. the Three Brothers 
are the only ones who * 
have ever scorned her 
boasts of immortality. 





The Brothers seek an earthly entrance 
to the realm of the gods, a gate into the 
Paradise of Souls. They believe they can 
ascend bodily into the heavens through a 
gate buried deep underground in an 
ancient tomb, thus avoiding immortality, 
to leave behind the trouble of Cerilia and 
live forever in a better world. 

The Three Brother Mages know a gate 
to paradise once existed in the central 
chamber of the Tomb of the Order of the 
Sun. They know the order was an ancient 
Khinasi company of knights, and they 
think the tomb is along the Qatil River, in 
the swamps, at the site of some ancient 
Masetian ruins (see The Lizard King). In 
fact, the tomb is not far from the cypress 
swamps at the mouth of the Qatil River, 
near a ruined temple of the order. 

Other great treasures are also 
buried in the tomb, though good 
PCs (especially paladins) might 
feel some alignment restric 
tions that prevent them 
from plundering the 
graves of good- 
aligned creatures. 


DM Note: Make clear your interpreta 
tion of the alignment restrictions atten 
dant on grave-robbing before the PCs 
take any action that might cause a change 
in alignment. 

the monkey kin<£ 

T he Monkey King is a force for 
chaos-always a trickster, never a 
ruler, but willing to take any chal 
lenge as long as it holds a hint of novelty 
or amusement. 

The Monkey King plans to use all the 
regents in this adventure for his amuse 
ment, although he sees most creatures as 
his pawns, not his equals. His goal isn't 
power or wealth, just a good laugh at 
everyone else's expense. 

It all began when the Monkey King was 
watching the Three Brother Mages through 
the eyes of Fitnat, the monkey familiar of 
the youngest brother, Rassan. Rassan was 
bragging to his brothers that the Sword of 
Roeie was the perfect device to trick the 
Chimera. They mentioned that they knew 
where it was, and told a few friends they 
were mounting an expedition to recover it 
so the Chimera would stop bothering them 
about their real plans. They gave the 


4 













Chimera some clues as to where it was "hid 
den," since she might send some of her 
henchmen there to recover it for her. They 
thought the relic of Roele was all they 
needed to drive the Chimera over the brink 
into complete, howling madness, making 
their lives and their control over her sources 
in the Chimaeron easier. 

The Monkey King knows the Three 
Brothers are searching for a gate to the 
outer planes and he wants to return to the 
Beastlands. He suspects that gates to these 
places exist in the Great Tomb of the Order 
of the Sun, but he would rather construct 
an elaborate scheme to find them without 
doing any actual work, and that's what he 
has done by stealing the Sword of Roele. He 
hopes the PCs do all the drudgery, prefer 
ably in some entertaining way. 

The Monkey King has placed the sword in 
the Chamber of the Ark-Royal (Area 53). 

the order of 
the sun 

I n the years -429 to -2 11 MR, the 
Basarji, the people who later became 
the Khinasi, were still largely free of 
Anuirean rule. Their gods, especially 
Avani, goddess of the sun and of reason, 
were widely worshipped, and their traders 
ranged far and wide. In the centuries after 
the disastrous battle at Deismaar, the 
Basarji had recovered and even prospered. 
But slowly, the awnsheghfien asserted 
their power in the lands between the iso 
lated city-states of the Sun Coast. 

To confront the awnsheghlien and pro 
tect the people of the Sun Coast, the priests 
of Avani in the lands of Binsada, on the 
Gulf of Coeranvs, founded an order of 
knighthood unique in Khinasi history. The 
Clerics of the Gulf were a frontier offshoot 
of the Great Scholars of Avani's Library. 
The knights they trained were holy war 
riors, male and female paladins who learned 
the art of taming both griffons and hip- 
pogriffs. The order soon achieved 


military, political, and spiritual might. It 
was variously known as the Order of the 
Sun, Avani's Order, or the Knights of the 
Eternal Sun. The order was always on the 
side of justice, tolerance, and reason, which 
won it fanatical admirers among the com 
mon people and grudging respect among 
the most jaded rulers. 

The citadel called the Spires of the Sun 
was the order's greatest stronghold. It 
was located in the city of Djafra, but most 
of its outposts were in the Iron Peaks, 
along the Tarvanian Hills, near the Rain 
Serpent Mountains, and elsewhere among 
the mountains. 

But the order was doomed to collapse. 
The elite force of adventurer-knights 
could not withstand the organized forces 
of the Anuirean Empire. The order's strug 
gle against the awnsheghlien suddenly 
became a war on two fronts, against both 
awnshegh and Anuirean. The ranks 
thinned, then vanished entirely when the 
last company of knights in the order 
fought in the great Battle of Asarwe 
against the Emperor Alandalae. The battle 
was won and Alandalae was killed by el- 
Arrasi after the order's final charge, but 
the ranks of knighthood were almost 
entirely destroyed, for Alandalae's honor 
guard exacted a heavy price as vengeance 
for their master's death. Later attempts to 
reestablish the order failed. 

Now all that remains of the Order of 
the Sun are the fortresses, temples, and 
tombs that it built. Most of these have 
been reclaimed by the priests of Avani and 
expanded into libraries, universities, and 
centers of learning, but a 
few have been entirely 

abandoned. \\ // - j

I f one of the PCs has a domain near 
the Chimaeron, getting them 
involved is easy. The conflict 
between the Brothers and the Chimera 
is a threat to the region and threatens 
the regent PCs. and if the PCs do not 

starting - the 
adventure 


meet with the Chimera, she declares war 
on them. It should make the PCs open 
to an offer from the Three Brother 
Mages (see The Astrologer). 

If the PCs are regents or scions in a dis 
tant region of Anuire or the Cities of the 
Sun. the Monkey King chooses the party 
to help. 

the astrologer 

f or a Khinasi ruler, having a court 
astrologer is a mark of status and eru 
dition. For an Anutrean, a visit from a 
learned scholar may be rare. If the regent 
chooses to speak to the astrologer in his 
audience chamber, read the following: 

A small, elderly man in ragged robes 
and a brightly-colored vest shuffles 
slowly into your audience chamber. He 
has long arms, short legs, and ears 
that stick out from his balding 
head. "Your Majesty, I 
have important tidings 
for you. but in 
exchange / ask a 
gift you do 
not have. 



6 


I 


I 


















Grant me two stars running with blood 
and I will tell you bow to confound an 
awmhegk and three wizards at the same 
time, and perhaps even gain a fragment 
of the Iron Throne. " 

If the PC regent doesn't agree, the 
astrologer says nothing more and leaves 
the court the next day. If the PC agrees to 
the astrologer's mysterious terms (he does 
not explain what he means by "stars run 
ning with blood"), read: 

" A comet of blue and purple has 
recently appeared among the stars, sig 
nalling great changes in the days to 
come. The horoscope I have cast for you 
shows that art awnshegh threatens the 
stability of Cerilia. Perhaps there will 
be more war between the Khinasi and 
the Anuirean Empire." 

The astrologer is the Monkey King in 
disguise, for he has taken an interest in 
the Chimera s madness, and comes to pay 
the PCs a call to lure them into his little 
schemes. To entice the PCs to make this 
trip, he offers them the key to the Trea 
sure Chamber (Area 21), which he gives 
to the PCs if they agree to visit the 
Chimera. He does not tell the PCs the 
purpose of the key. 

If the PCs refuse, he goes to the 
Chimera herself and cajoles her into ask 
ing for an audience with the PCs. 

the bard 

I f the PCs dismiss or ignore the astrol 
oger, a minstrel named Stella the 
Golden comes to visit them. She 
serves the Three Brothers, who say the 
Chimera will soon attempt to claim the 
Sword of Roele , and they need help to get 
it first. They don't want it themselves, but 
are willing to let the PC regent take it. 
They say they have chosen him for his 
sterling reputation, courage, and heroism. 

In fact, the Brothers planted the rumors 
about the Sword of Roele in the Chimera's 


court (the Council of Leaders) them 
selves. They want the PCs to open the 
tomb for their own reasons (explained in 
The Three Brother Mages). 

audience with 
the chimera 

I I the astronomer and the bard both 
fail to convince the PC regent to 
leave his realm and seek out adven 
ture, the Chimera requests an audience 
with the regent. 

If the regent refuses to see the Chimera, 
he has made a powerful enemy, and might 
suffer several hostile Agitate and even 
Contest Holding actions. If he seeks to 
kill the Chimera, it becomes clear that the 
Chimera sent a projected image in her 
stead. However, any fight can kill many of 
the regent's retainers, courtiers, and men- 
at-arms. If the regent agrees to see her 
and treats her nobly, read: 

The Chimera is a half-elf woman with a 
frighteningly calm demeanor-the calm of 
barely contained madness. She approaches 
the throne, nods her head as one ruler to 
another, and speaks in a smooth, slow voice. 
"The sun sets, the moons wander, and the stars 
fade, l alone endure ." The Chitnera cuts her 
self with a small knife. The blood drips onto 
the flagstones, then the cut heals itself, 

"Yet immortality alone is not always 
enough. My lands, the Chimaeron, have 
long been plagued by outlaws, bandits, and 
renegades fleeing justice. Three of the great 
est thieves of all Cerilia now seek to hide 
themselves. They have towers in two of 
my cities, without my permission or the 
consent of my vassals, the Council 
of Leaders. I want you to destroy 
these three. In exchange, 1 
offer you the location of 
the treasure they brag 
about: the sword of 
Michael Roele, 


7 


fast emperor of Anuire. 

"My own militia has proven itself incompe 
tent in capturing these thieves. I rarely ask aid 
of others, but when I do, I reward faithful 
assistance very well, and I mercilessly punish 
those who oppose me. Do not refuse me." 


The Chimera speaks through her magi 
cal projected image. 

In exchange for destroying the Broth 
ers, she offers something that she doesn't 
have-the location of the Sword of Roele. If 
that isn't enough, she reminds the regent 
that if the PCs find out what the Three 
Brothers are searching for, she might form 
an alliance with the PCs' kingdom. Hating 
an awnshegh to call on should make any 
regent sleep more soundly. 



travel to the 
chimaeron 


etting to the Chimaeron is no prob- 
fl lent if the PCs are not taking an 
army with them. The astrologer 
tells the regent that the "two bloody 
stars" (the Sword of Roele and its two 
gems) are "hidden in the remains of the 
Sun." Bv this cryptic clue, he attempts to 
point the adventurers toward the Order of 
the Sun. 





transporting 

troops 

T aking troops through intervening 
kingdoms can be done with the 
permission of the ruler in question. 
Otherwise, a declaration of war is required 
first. Getting permission requires a suc 
cessful Diplomacy domain 
action with each regent 
on the path between 
the PC's kingdom 




' < (tm) 


and the Chimaeron. A seafaring kingdom 
can. of course, debark troops to the Chi 
maeron by sea, arriving in the ports of 
Hamein, Mhowe. or Luandar. One of the 
towers of the Three Brothers stands in 
Hamein. In Mhowe, the barflies and gos 
sips tell tales of threats from the Harrow- 
marsh and the better-in formed members 
of the Chimera's militia know about the 
Bird Maiden of the Iron Peaks, who has 
been unusually active to the west of late 
(see The Apes and the Bird Maiden). In 
the port of Luandar, tales circulate that 
the Chimera is planning something in the 
delta swamps, that travelers are missing 
between Luandar and Lyssan, and that 
there are bandits operating along the 
Qatil River. 

If the PCs do not want to transport 
troops the traditional way, the Monkey 
King (in his astrologer disguise) can use 
his teleport ability to bring 1 unit. How 
ever, he refuses to teleport more than 1 
unit and he charges a hefty price for his 
services, demanding a favor "to be named 
later," If the PCs agree, the Monkey King 
might call in this favor later to claim the 
SwortPof Roele (see Concluding the Adven 
ture) or to claim another rich treasure 
(such as being invested in one of the PC's 
guild holdings as a vassal). 

The Chimera can magically transport 
as many as 13 units a distance of 1 
province, 6 units as far as 2 provinces. 3 
units as far as 4 provinces. 2 units as far 
as 6 provinces, and 1 unit as far as 13 
provinces away. Any unit so transported 
arrives in the city of Lyssan. avoiding 
intervening kingdoms entirely. But to 
cast the spell the Chimera must have a 
source (0) and a ley line to the province 
in which the units start. 


8 


T s 

a 


ie lands ruled by the 
Chimera are called the 
C himaeron, They extend 
from the Gulf of Coeranys to 
the dwarven realm of Baruk-Azhik, cover 
ing most of the hills and mountains between 
Rohrmarch and the kingdom of Coeranys. 
The region is a safe haven for scoundrels 
and outlaws from both the Khinasi and 
Anuirean homelands. 

The Chimaeron is nominally ruled by 
the Chimera, but in practice she has ceded 
control to a group of terrified, but loyal 
vassals called the Council of Leaders. The 
leaders know nothing of her plans, but 
they are aware of her rivalry and interest in 
the Three Brothers. The PCs may meet 
members of the council in Lvssan, Careine 
City, Ruorkhe, Luandar, Broken Hill, 
Barniere, or Mhowe. However, an audi 
ence with the Chimera's vassals might not 
help as much as the PCs hope. 

the council of 
leaders 

T he council knows almost nothing 
about the Chimera's plans. They 
hear from her only when she has 
orders for them to carry out. If the PCs 
claim to be her agents, they are treated 
with fawning politeness by the council 
members. If not, they must bribe their 
way past unscrupulous outlaws, petty 
bureaucrats, and stern honor guards 
before they can speak with any council 
member. See the Blood Enemies 
Birthright Accessory' for more details of 
the council's operation, and for a war card 
representing a typical unit of the 
Chimera's constabulary. 


the 
chimaeron 


Though the council knows little about the 
Chimera, it does know that the Three 
Brothers seek to expand the realms of the 
Anuirean Empire-particularly Coeranys- 
into the old Khinasi colonies of Anuire, 
claiming rich trading ports 
and trade routes. They 
view the Brothers as 
a threat to 
their already- 
tenuous rule. 
However, 

they are understandably reluctant to men 
tion this to Anuirean rulers, since the 
council members themselves stand to ben 
efit from Khinasi control of the western 
lands. They also are reluctant to mention 
this to any Khinasi rulers who come call 
ing. After all, it might be a test of loyalty 
by a PC ally of either the Chimera or the 
Brothers. Charm spells, thought reading 
magic, or lavish bribes might convince 
them to share information. Otherwise, the 
leaders babble courteously and keep their 
thoughts to themselves. 

luandar, lyssan, 
fiamein, and 


mhowe 


T hese four towns are those the PCs 
are most likely to visit in the Chi 
maeron. Other towns in the region 
are described in Blood Enemies. 

Luandar is no more than a 
village, ruled by a 
paranoid Rjurik 
rogue named 
Otslof.

Tt is a port town, but not a rich one. Its 
citizens are pirates and assassins. The 
streets are dirty, urchins roam the fields 
and docks, and little of value passes 
through the port. 

Lyssan, the capital of the Chimaeron, is 
the seat of government for the Council of 
Leaders. The town's stone and wood 
houses are built on a mountain plateau. 
Its terraced fields are spread out on the 
plateau and below. Most of the town's 
money comes from metalwork, mining, 
and the arms trade. 

The council meets in a large tower near 
the eastern cliff. The mayor is Yuri 
Khavlor, a Vos druid who lost his faith in 
Erik when his only daughter was slain by a 
wild boar in the forests. He has since 
gained a love for gold and is rather blunt 
in his requests for bribes. 

Hamein is the port for the Chimaeron 
and lies across the river from Kiedel. The 
town's mayor is Lord Myonos. Hamein is 
a bargaining chip for the Chimaeron 
because its side of the river controls the 
better harbor, Kiedel constantly silts up 
and the city, the capital of the Rohrmarch, 
is built on bug-infested swampland. Lord 
Myonos controls the ferrymen between 
the two cities, siphoning profits from 
their honest work and making the trip 
unaffordable for the masses and smaller 
merchants. A "popular uprising" bv 
Rohrmarch is alw'ays a danger, but so far 
Lord Myonos has given his neighbors no 
excuse for war. 

Mhow r e is the richest port and the best- 
kept city because of its distance from its 
overlord. Ruled by the self-proclaimed 
"Prince" Denerik, the city thrives on trade 
and smuggling that he controls. He is an 
expert in poisons and plots against the 
other members of the council, and will 
gladly help the PCs against the Chimera. 


the vnoll 
raiders 

T he Chimera's lands are beset by a 
band of gnolls that is raiding com 
merce. sacking small villages, and 
plundering the countryside. If the PCs 
have transported their own troops here, 
the Chimera or the Brothers may ask 
them to defeat the gnolls to prove their 
worthiness, as a test of loyalty, or as a wild 
goose chase. ("You know, I've heard 
rumors that the gnoll leader has a power 
ful shining blade . . .") 

The gnolls leave an obvious trail. When 
the PC troops catch up with the raiders, 
use a number of Gnoll Marauder and 
Gnoll Infantry war cards (#73, #74, #75) 
from the Birthright boxed set equal to 
the number of PC troops to represent 
the gnolls, and fight the battle normally. 
Use the Sphinx's Gnoll Marauders cards 
from the Blood Enemies Accessory if 
more cards are needed (#BE20 and 
#BE2i). If the PCs win, they are 
acclaimed as heroes and can gather 2 GB 
of plunder from the gnolls' baggage train. 
If they lose, their army is scattered and 
routed in a foreign land. 

When the PCs return to their patron, 
they will have passed the test. They are 
immediately given another rumor (legiti 
mate) to investigate: "Oh, you didn't find 
the blade? My spies assured me it was 
there. Well, there is another tale making 
the rounds that the true resting 
place is an ancient tomb 
somewhere in the 
Cypress Valley." 




T o avoid any risks, the Brothers want 
the PCs to travel the length of the 
Qatil River to find and open the 
tomb of the order. As far as they are con 
cerned, the story about the Sword of Roele is 
false. They can't go themselves because they 
can't reveal their true goal to the Chimera. 

The Chimera wants the PCs to go to 
the Cypress River valley to find out what 

the Three Brothers 
are up to, and she 
correctly suspects 
§ that the troop move 
ments in Kiergard 
indicate that some 
thing is amiss in the 
Gorgon's realm (per 
haps he has discov 
ered that the sword 
is missing). She 
knows of the ancient 
tomb, and she lies to 
the PCs, offering them the Sword of Roele 
in exchange for information about what 
lies at the heart of the tomb. Until now. 
she and her agents have been kept aw r ay 
from the tomb. Of course, that only sharp 
ens her curiosity. 

The valley is home to a surprising 
number of schemers who thrive in the 
lawless territory in sparsely-populated 
Coeranvs, near both the Anuirean and 
Khinasi kingdoms.

\ the lizard kin<y 

The most powerful of the area's petty lords 
is Sorminor. the Lizard King who unified 
the reptilian swampdwellers. He 
seeks to build a great city at the 
mouth of the river. He has 
commanded his followers 
to build the city using 
stones from the 
mins of a prior 
settlement, an 
ancient 
Masetian 






14 















colony that failed long ago. The Lizard King 
and his followers live at the spot marked "L" 
on the Cypress Valley map. 

The colony was just a small trading out 
post, What remains are not wooden huts 
or palisades, but heaped mounds of earth 
and the great stone serpent built by the 
Masetians. The 550-foot long stone ser 
pent has been somewhat eroded, undercut 
by its proximity to the river. All the terrain 
between the mounds and the serpent is 
swampy and waterlogged with occasional 
pools of standing water as deep as 12 feet.

Though Sorminor does most of the 
thinking for the tribe, he delegates some 
duties to the war leader. Katinnos. Katin- 
nos leads the hunts and patrols and 
watches the muckdwellers. Katinnos, 
Sorminor, and the honor guard warriors 
all live on the large western mound.

The Lizard King and his w r ar leader 
sometimes consult with the tribe's shaman 
and his two assistants, usually for divina- 
tory or healing spells. The tribe's spiritual 
leaders live on the smallest of the site's 
three mounds, in a lean-to built up against 
a dead oak tree.

The tribe's warriors are suspicious of 
Katinnos, for he sometimes questions the 
orders of Sorminor, whom they regard 
with awe. The warriors live on the second 
large mound and share the space with the 
tribe's lizard mounts. 

Sorminor is responsible for the expedi 
tion into the Iron Peaks that brought the 
tribe four giant minotaur lizard eggs, a 
type of lizard that normally doesn't live in 
swamps. The eggs were hatched and the 
lizards were trained to serve the tribe as 
mounts. The warriors consider tending 
them an honor. When riding minotaur 
lizards into battle the lizardmen gain all 
the usual benefits of mounted cavalry (+1 
bonus to hit, +1 bonus to AC).

The lizard men both protect and enslave 
many tiny muckdwellers that live along the 
river. Though they are not brave, the muck- 
dwellers make small guerilla attacks against 
hostile parties within the tribe's camp, then 
quickly withdraw. If the lizard men are los

first to flee. The muckdwellers live along 
the length of the stone serpent, in small 
holes and burrows near the waterline.

Living among the hills east of the valley is 
a bird maiden named Jamila al-Hamam. 
She is the patron and mentor of a small 
tribe of carnivorous apes who are her fol

cliff dwelling is at the spot marked "B" on

the forest west of there, occasionally 
going south to the area of the tomb.

T he Three Brothers have towers in 
Hamein and Mhowe in the Chi- 
maeron, and one in the province of 
Misti I in the kingdom of Coeranvs (where 
they have most of their holdings). They 
hope to seize another source in the Hvdra s 
swamp or the mountains of Baruk-Azhik, 
hut the Chimera has kept them too busy 
defending what they have to contemplate 
any further expansion. The provinces 
where they control sources are listed here.

shipment point for smugglers from 
both east and west. The tower is 
20 feet in diameter, 60 feet

Meganno keeps the Brother's treasury', 
a total of 10 GB. hidden in a portable hole 
which he keeps folded up and neatly 
tucked into a scroll tube that hangs from 
his belt at all times. The tube is protected 
by an alarm spell. 

Meganno s two apprentices couldn't be 


more different. One is a red-haired, half- 
Vos wild woman from the north, the other 
a serious, cultured Khinasi follower of 
Ayani who trained at the university of 
Ajami. They both have similar levels of 
skill, both young mages just beginning to 
master the art of magic.

The Ebony Tower 

The Ebony Tower is the home of the middle 
brother, Avicerra the Wise. It stands in the 
province of Hamein, just across the Khurin- 
bym River from the city of Kiedel, capital of 
Rohrmarch. Avicerra's tower is constantly 
patrolled by a pack of baboons. These ani 
mals have been traditionally used 
as guard or policing animals, 
much as dogs are used among 
the Anuireans. 

The black stone tower 
has three stories, and 
the baboons con 
trol the lower 
two. The front

doors are permanently wizard-locked, hut 
the doors onto the docks are not. Avicerra 
rarely comes down from the top floor by the 
stairs. He prefers to feather fall down.

The baboons roam the tower's 
grounds at will, often sitting in 
the trees or on window' sills 
to view their surroundings 
(so they are less likely 
to be surprised).

the cypress tower 

The Cypress Tower is the home of the 
youngest brother, Rassan the Hasty, and it is 
the newest tower of the Three Brother 
Mages. It is four floors high and divided into 
three sections at the top. Built in the depths 
of the forest near the Tomb of the Order, it 
is well protected by magical wardings and 
connected by a ley line to the source in 
Deepshadow. The Brothers hope to seize 
the source here (in the province of Careine) 
when the Chimera is otherwise occupied. 

The tower is guarded by a powerful gob 
lin bodyguard and a seductive svlph, as well 
as Rassan. The goblin serves for money and 
in gratitude for the mage who raised him 
after he was abandoned by his parents on a 
caravan route in the wake of a disastrous 
raid. The sylph serves him out of love, and 
would lay down her life to save his.

Rassan is almost always home and is

who pays him even the most basic courte

accused Rassan of breaching any law of 
hospitality; date wine, figs, and swe£t deli 
cacies are always offered, even to those 
who have done him wrong in the past. Of 
course, Rassan is no fool. His bodyguards 
are never far away, and his spells are 
always at his fingertips.

Rainblossom is a special sylph,

have been inseparable ever since. 

rassan's tale 

If the PCs approach the Cypress Tower 
peacefully, they are admitted by Rainblos 
som and ushered into Rassan's study, 
where they are treated to lavish hospitality 
(Garfang acts as waiter and butler) and 
kind courtesy. If the PCs ask for details 
of what the bard meant about the 
Sword of Roele, Rassan replies: 







In the course of my studies I have found 
that the sword of Michael Roele was not 
lost in the Gorgon's Crown, as many 
believe. It wets taken by some of Prince 
Raesene's dwarf servants, those who 
forged it long ago, and given to an 
ancient order of Khinasi knights. The 
knights are long gone, but the sword is 
probably still in their treasury-and 
only I know where it lies hidden. 

My brothers and I can be quite gen 
erous. We will let you keep the sword if 
you find something else for us-a magi 
cal gate that is said to exist at the heart 
of their treasury, beyond four great 
arches, in the east. 

You can ask any of my brothers. They 
will tell you the same. 

If the PCs have questions, Rassan is 
happy to answer them as best he can. 
Assuming they accept the deal, Rassan 
tells them that the treasury (he doesn't 
call it a tomb) lies "somewhere along the 
River Qatil in Western Chimaeron." 

He asks the PCs if they require shelter. 
They are put up for the night if necessary, 
then treated to a rich Khinasi breakfast 
and shown on their way. He speaks to his 
brother Meganno regarding the bargain 
he has struck. Meganno follows the PCs' 
progress through his crystal ball. 

the oak tourer 

Clearly of elven workmanship, this ancient 
tower in the province of Deepshadow in 
Coeranvs is the last refuge of the Three 
Brother Mages from the Chimera. 

The Monkey King currently makes his 
home in this tower, largely because 
he enjoys using the crystal ball at 
the top of the tower to watch 
what the Chimera, the PCs, 
and the Three Brother 
Mages are doing.

I n the days before the Anuireans came 
to Khinasi, when the land was still 
ruled by the Basarji traders, an order 
of flying knights defended the city-states. 
This was the Order of the Sun, a brother 
hood of paladins, chosen from the ranks 
of the soldiers of Avani, goddess of the 
sun. Their dead were buried in an elabo 
rate tomb complex on the Qatil River, but 
that complex was eventually abandoned 
when the 
order 
retreated 
from the 
advancing 
Anuirean 
armies. 

The order 
defended the 
Khinasi against the 
Anuireans during the 
expansion of the Anuirean 
empire, but fell apart when 
their ranks were decimated in battle with 
Emperor Alandaiae. The last of their 
strongholds, in Djafra, fell in the year 
1207 Masetian Reckoning (-281 MR) to a 
local warlord. 

the architect 

W hile the knights fought for the 
protection of the innocent and 
the priests sought to use reason 
to bring enlightenment to the Basarji, they 
hired a mage named Djuhah el-Mimar, 
the Architect, to build a tomb worthy of 
their heroes. El-Mimar asked only 
that he be well-paid and that he 
and his helpers be buried in 
the tomb as well. 


Unknown to the Order of the Sun, they 
had invited a viper into their midst. El- 
Mimar was a necromancer as well as an 

architect, 
and he 
planned to 
return from 
his own 
death as a 
lich. with 
enough 
power to 

seize and control the distant 
site he had chosen for the 
Great Tomb of the Order, far 
from the Cities of the Sun 
(but, as he told the priests, conveniently 
close to the Anuireans, who required close 
watching). 

Using a transmute rock to mud spell, el- 
Mimar completed the excavation in record 
time. The tomb's elaboration, finishing, and 
detail work took much longer. The priests 
were alarmed when they first heard of their 
architect's proposed traps, some of which 
were quite deadly and not in keeping with 
their teachings. Though the architect 
assuaged their fears, saying these stern 
measures were required to "ensure the 
safety and sanctity of the honorable dead," 
one of the last acts of the priests was to cre 
ate a set of golems guarding the main pas 
sage of the tomb, to prevent any foul play 
on et-Mimar's part, for they regarded him 
with increasing suspicion.

T he tomb of the order lies beneath a 
small cliff by the river. The entrance 
to the tomb once looked out over 
the sea itself, but centuries of silt carried 
down the river have spread the marshy 
delta miles downriver. 

The entrance to the tomb is overgrown

can be found. They include the giant Ken- 
gri {see The Sleeper's Gate), the priest 
haunt {see The Temple Rttirts). and the bird 
maiden Jamila al-Hamam (see The Apes 
and the Bird Maiden). 

the temple 
mins 

utside the tomb, atop the cliff, lie 
the ruins of a temple to Basaia, 
Avani's forerunner, who w T as 
destroyed at Deismaar. The temple is 
haunted by the spirit of Basarej. the last 
high priest of the temple, cut down by 
Anuirean knights. The haunt has useful 
information but will not speak at first. He 
will try to possess a party member if he 
can. If he succeeds, he tries to walk into 
the tomb with the possessed body, fight 


ing past the troglodytes (Areas 1 and 2) 
and using the passwords to get past the 
golems (Area 18). Unless he has pos 
sessed the body of a very powerful lighter, 
he probably won't make it. 

If possession fails or the haunt is 
turned, he explains that he remains here 
rather than going into the Shadow World 
or the afterlife because the burial services 
for Yezeed el-Sams, the last knight to be 
buried in the tomb, were never carried out 
(see Area 22). The haunt cannot reach 
the tomb, but he will ask to be allowed 
to possess one of the PCs and carry' 
out the rites himself, to lay his 
spirit to rest. Any PC who 
grants permission should 
gain an immediate story 
aw'ard of 500 XP. If not 
granted permission, 
the haunt 


' : V 

* I L d 















asks the PCs to carry out the rites for him. 
For Basarej to carry out the rites him 
self, however, requires that he use the pos 
sessed body to gather his consecrated 
priestly items and vestments from beneath 
the temple's altar. Touching the altar with 
the body of an unbeliever releases a fire 
elemental, a servant of the goddess.

SZ H (16' tall); ML fanatic (17); Int 
low (5-7): AL N; XP 10,000. 

The elemental cannot cross the river, 
but it remains for three days before it 
burns out all flammable materials within 
500 yards of the temple and is forced to 
return to the Elemental Plane of Fire, 

If the PCs approach the haunt peace 
fully or give him an offering, the haunt is 
appeased and does not attempt to possess 
a PC. If the PCs sw'ear an oath on their 
royal blood to give the knight's spirit a 
proper burial, the haunt tells the PCs the 
password to disarm the force-spear trap in 
the Hall of Force-''Hudanat" (Area 37), 
the magic words Qantarat and Zill that gov 
ern the Bridge of Sighs and Shadows (Area 
9), and the danger of the golden lions in 
the Chamber of Marshalls (Area 38). 
Breaking the oath will reduce the PCs' 
bloodline by ld6 to ldlO bloodline points, 
depending on how they treat the oath 
(unable to fulfill it, ignoring it, or stealing 
from the body they swore to bury).

the tower

O pposite the temple, on the west 
ern side of the river, lies the intact 
tower of the order, a fortress and 
lookout point topped by a warning beacon 
in times past. The tower was breached by 
magic (the disintegration of the western 
wall is still clearly visible) and sacked 
twice, once when the Anuireans first 
crossed the Khinasi border, and once 
when they were driven out. 

A great four-walled keep with its four 
comer towers stands on the western side 
of the river The northwestern tower is 
crowned with an enormous nest of 
branches, like a large stork's nest. Vow 
hear a powerful eagle's cry and see a 
tiny black figure circling far above. 

The tower is now home to two griffons, 
the wild descendants of the order's mounts 
from long ago. Their nest covers the top of 
the northwest tower, 60 feet up. The lad 
ders that once led up from the ground floor 
to the tops of the towers are gone, rotted 
away or converted to nesting material.

The griffons have amassed consider 
able treasure over the centuries, as they 


and their ancestors took various baubles 
from passing travelers and caravans. 
Most of their nest is made of horse bones, 
skulls, and the bones of smaller animals, 
but many valuables are among the 
remains. The treasure includes four bolts 
of silk cloth (100 gp each), 8,000 sp, a 
gold necklace set with a black opal (500 
gp), a bracelet of silver with a repeating 
design of feathers (100 gp), a silver ring 
of excellent workmanship carved to 
resemble a running pack of wolves (200 
gp), and a flask of oil of fiery burning , A 
rod of splendor (5 charges) is woven into 
the nest, though the PCs can find it only 
by employing a detect magic or similar div 
ination. It is too deeply buried to find 
without taking the nest apart (an eight- 
hour job for one worker),

f ¦ ^he bridge over the river is guarded at 
either end by a ruined gate left over 
from a time when this was a 
defended border crossing. The bridge is 
creaky but solid. The eastern gate has an 
unusual statue just outside it, called the 
Sleeping Kengri. The statue is more than 20 
feet long and resembles a giant in repose. In 
fact, it is a petrified sleeping giant, 
enchanted to wake whenever robbers seek 
to despoil the tomb. Of course, the giant 
can also be woken with a transmute stone to 
flesh spell or a successful dispel magic.

In battle. Kengri levitates himself and 
one opponent high above the battle (mis 
siles shot into the air have a 1 in 4 chance 
of hitting a human size opponent instead 
of Kengri), He calls on the griffons of the 
tower for aid (he's been asleep for cen 
turies and doesn't know that they've gone 
wild). Surprisingly, responding to some 
dim racial memory, the wild griffons 
answer his summons and help him in the 
airborne combat. Assuming he wins the 
fight, he then summons a storm and pur 
sues the rest of the party with call light 
ning and lightning bolt spells. 

If he is not attacked by the party, Ken 
gri will gladly speak to the warriors in an 
ancient dialect of the Khinasi tongue. Anv 
Khinasi native can understand him with a 
successful Intelligence check at a -5 
penalty. Otherwise magic is required. He 
assumes that the PCs have come to seek 
membership in the order, or that they are 
members from another stronghold of the 
order come to restore the tower fortress 
on the other side of the river.

the outside world (the giant still hasn't 



heard that el-Arrasi freed the Basaiji from 
the Anuireans). the giant may well be won 
over and reveal the entrance to the tomb, 
just to the north. 

Kengri has never been inside the tomb, 
and so cannot tell the party what lies 
within. All he knows is that the tomb con 
tains the remains of the "brave knights 
who defended the creatures of the valley 
against the slaughter of the Anuirean 
armies." Any PC who proclaims allegiance 
to Anuire is instantly challenged by Ken 
gri to single combat. Those who decline 
are cowards in his eyes, and Kengri orders 
them to leave the area immediately. 

Kengri is one of only a few creatures 
who know where the entrance to the tomb 
is hidden. If he is convinced that the PCs 
have a good reason for entering the tomb 
(such as laying the ghost of the priest in the 
temple to rest), he tells them where to look, 
Otherwise, they will have to ask the muck- 
dwellers (see the Cypress Valley Encounters 
Table) or other swamp inhabitants.

the lesser 
chambers 

T he lower set of chambers was con 
structed first and was for those 
warriors whose valor was great 
enough to guarantee them a place in the 
order's pantheon of heroes. The architect 
used transmute rock to mud spell to carve 
out 20- by 20-foot areas. The ceilings are 
all 12 feet high (tall enough for hunched 
giants and upright golems to pass 
through). The halls are unlit except where 
noted otherwise. 

1. The Entrance: The entryway is well 
hidden by vines and leaves and resembles 
a small hole or cave entrance-just large 
enough for a halfling or dwarf tunnel 
fighter to wriggle into. The entrance was 
once a series of broad steps carved into 
the rocks, but they were completely 
buried when the entrance was deliber 
ately collapsed. 

Anyone searching the ground around 
the hole can see a small path leading from 
it to the river. A successful tracking profi 
ciency check reveals troglodyte tracks that 
might otherwise be mistaken for lizard- 
man. gnoll. or even giant bird tracks. 

Clearing the way for larger creatures to 
get in requires magic or at least 6 man 
hours of work with shovels, 12 hours with 
out. No more than six creatures can dig at 
any one time. If the giant Kengri helps, 
the time required is cut in half. 

However, the entryway is protected by 
a troglodyte guard who uses his 
chameleon power to blend into the stone 
(-4 penalty to PCs' surprise rolls). The 
guard won't come out to fight against 
superior numbers, but fighting in the 
tunnel presents its own problems. Slash 
ing and bludgeoning weapons are almost 
useless in the narrow tunnel (-2 to attack 
rolls, -4 to damage), but piercing 
weapons work normally.

Javelins add +3 to attack roll when 
thrown by troglodytes and inflict 2d4 
damage. Troglodytes secrete a nause 
ating oil; those failing saving throws 
vs. poison lose ld6 points of Strength 
for 10 rounds. 

Anyone who digs encounters the sentry 
and his overpowering combat scent (-3 to 
saving throw vs. poison because of the 
enclosed space), If the alarm is raised and 
the combat goes on for more than 3 
rounds, the troglodytes feign a retreat, let 
one warrior through, and immediately 
close the gap to prevent others from com 
ing through. The tribe then surrounds and 
attempts to slay the single warrior with 
superior numbers (as many as six 
troglodytes can attack in the tomb's 
15-foot wide entrance passage). 

2, Chamber of Lions: The first chamber 
of the tomb was the entrance where offer 
ings were left for the spirits of the dead. A 
small fountain still bubbles in the south 
west corner of the room. There are lions 
carved in the lintel over every doorway 
and tw r o bronze lions decorate the foun 
tain. The bronze doors to the western exit 
are off their hinges and lie corroding a 
deep green on the floor. 

The chamber is now home to a small 
tribe of troglodytes who do not appreciate 
visitors, except as food. Their numbers have 
increased lately, and they are not faring well 
in the hunt, so their food stocks are very 
low. Almost any excuse provokes an attack.

13(x3), 12, U(x2), 10(x3), 9(x7):

inflict 2d4 damage. 

Troglodytes secrete a nauseating 
oil; those failing saving throvys vs. 
poison lose ld6 points of Strength for 
10 rounds. 

If the troglodytes lose 10 or more of 
their number, they retreat into Areas 3 
and 6. In the storage area they climb up 
the tunnel into the audience chamber 
(Area 8). They are cold-blooded so they 
suffer only one-quarter damage from the 
brown mold's cold. In the hall, they hide 
in the shadows behind the statues, waiting 
for a chance to ambush foes. 

The troglodytes have amassed some 
treasure from looting the first few cham 
bers of the tomb and from looting the bod 
ies of victims ambushed in the wilderness. 
The treasures include 1,000 cp. 1,000 sp. a 
silver horseshoe (10-gp), two rusty hel 
mets, a broken lance, and 20 gems (two 
10-gp lapis lazuli, four 10-gp moss agates, 
three 50-gp moonstones, six 100-gp blood 
stones, four 500-gp carved jade elephants, 
and a 5.000-gp star sapphire). 

With the loot are broken bits of statu 
ary and three intact statues. These w*ere 
graven images, small statues set up before 
an altar where pilgrims and mourners 
could offer prayers and small tokens of 


32 



their devotion to the departed. When the 
shrine was stiil in use, there was a statue 
for each of the creatures and warriors 
buried in the tomb, but most are now bro 
ken and unrecognizable. The only figures 
that remain are a warrior in plate armor, a 
stonecutter bearing a mallet and chisel, 
and a priest with a shaven head and 
Avani's holy symbol (a setting sun). 

3. Root Cellar: This large room was once a 
storage area for the temple and tower on 
the surface, storing wine casks, barrels of 
fruit, cheeses, and tools and supplies 
unavailable in the wilderness. All the food 
is gone and all the supplies have been taken 
by the troglodytes in the Chamber of Lions 
(Area 2). The remnants of the troglodytes' 
recent kills are stored here: two plucked 
parrots, some fish heads, and a stringy, 
gamey hindquarter from a wild boar. 

The troglodytes have also dug a tunnel 
connecting this room with the tomb's 
Feasting Hall (Area 8). Dirt and stone are 
heaped around the entrance to the tunnel. 
It is just big enough for a troglodyte slith 
ering on its belly, and it slants up sharply. 
Anyone climbing it is susceptible to the 
cold attack of the brown mold in the 
Feasting Hall. 

4. Priests' Crypt: This hall is the final 
resting place of the lesser priests and 
scribes who served Avani and the order in 
the temple. Each is buried in a small her 
mit's cell, wrapped in a simple shroud and 
laid on his side with a golden holy symbol 
of Avani in his hands (50 gp). 

5. Chamber of Doves: This shrine to the 
goddess Avani was believed to have heal 
ing powers and pilgrims often stopped 
here. Water drips from the ceiling into a 
bowl on the altar before a statue. Because 
the shrine still has Avani's blessing, the 
bowl contains 10 vials of holy water. Any 
additional water added to the bowl 
becomes holy water in 24 hours. 


Any PC who makes an offering receives a 
bless spell that lasts 1 hour. Paladins of 
Avani w T ho pray and make an offering also 
receive an aid spell that lasts 1 hour. 

6. Hall of Heroes: This 15-foot-wide hall 
runs the length of the tomb complex and 
is ornamented with 7-foot-tall stone stat 
ues of Khinasi warriors, some male, some 
female, but all obviously ready for battle, 
with full armor and weapons in hand. The 
second statue on the left was destroyed by 
the troglodytes in an odd form of revenge 
against the two statues that killed one of 
their number who tried to go farther down 
the passage (the caryatid columns). 

The bodies of two tomb robbers lie at 
the two spots marked X, cut down as they 
made their way down the passage. They 
were slain when they tried to pass the 
caryatid columns without giving the 
proper password. (PCs can learn the pass 
word Jasarat from the haunt in the ruined 
temple, or they can gain one of the 
amulets from Areas 32, 33, or 38 that 
allow them to pass.) If a speak with dead 
spell that reaches back at least 100 years 
is cast on the robbers' remains, they share 
what they know. They were attacked by 
the stone women and knew that the Great 
Tomb of the Order of the Sun was filled 
with the servants and riches of the god 
dess Avani. They were hired by el-Mimar 
to wake him from his magical slumber 
(Area 34), in exchange for his help in 
looting the tomb.

Neither of the robbers has much of 
value, other than a wax-sealed scroll 
case containing a wa"d of negation (4 
charges) that they were supposed 


M 


11 


to use to wake el-Mimar. 

7. Chamber of the Fox: Peti 
tioners, scholars, mourn 
ers, and others came to 
this room when they 
sought justice, 
knowledge, 





34 % 








or comfort from the order. Because it 
served as waiting room and antechamber 
for the Feasting Hall (Area 8), benches 
line the walls of the room. 

Three small steps lead up from this 
room to the Feasting Hall where the 
order's Grand Marshall conducted audi 
ences. The tattered remnants of a tapestry 
or curtain at the top of the steps hides the 
brown mold in the room beyond. Anyone 
standing near the northern end of the 
steps when the curtain is lifted or drawn 
aside is immediately vulnerable to the 
mold's freezing attack. 

8. Feasting Hall: Although it was more 
often used as an audience chamber for the 
high priest or the Grand Marshall, wakes 
and other celebrations to remember the 
dead were also held in this hall. All that 
remains is a long table, large enough to 
seat 50 mourners. The troglodytes 
destroyed most of the chairs for firewood. 

They now throw their wastes in here to 
feed the brown mold that covers the north 
ern third of the room. The mold occasion 
ally serves them as a weapon, for their rep 
tilian physiology makes them resistant to its 
attacks. The gnaw'ed remains of anyone 
captured by the troglodytes in the entrance 
tunnel (Area 1) are brought here and 
tossed into the mold. 

Brown mold (mold): AC 9; MV 0; 
HD N/A; hp N/A; THACO N/A; #AT 
0; Dmg N/A; SA freezing for 4d8 
points of damage per round to all 
creatures within 5"; SD immune to 
weapons and fire; SW plant-affecting 
magic works: wall of ice or ice storm 
makes it dormant for 5d6 turns; cone 
of cold or disintegrate kills it; SZ L; Int 
non (0); AL N; XP 15. 

Fire and heat allow brown mold to 
grow. If a torch is used nearby, it dou 
bles in size, flaming oil quadruples it, 
and a fireball spell causes it to grow 
eight-fold. 














Underneath the mold are the bones of 
some small rodents, a few rusted weapons, 
and a helm of the order. Anyone wearing the 
helm will not be attacked by the ghost war 
riors in the warriors' graves (Areas 12-14), 

9. Chamber of Shadows: This was the 
priests' embalming and funerary chamber. 
Here they prepared the bodies of the 
tomb for burial. 

Three of this chamber's walls are cov 
ered with an abstract pattern of black 
lines. The fourth wall depicts a black 
bridge over a misty chasm to a gate of 
light. Words are carved into three of the 
four stone w alls. 

Natron and other salts, bandages, 
and fntriai shrouds, all incredibly old 
and brittle looking, are sitting on the 
chambers shelves. Three slanted slabs of 
stones sit in the room. Each slab has sev 
eral grooves cut in it from top to bottom. 


The words carved in the walls are: 
Linger not in the land between the living 
and the dead (a warning not to overstay a 
visit in the Divination Room, Area 10) 
on the east wall. Bring worthy offerings to 
honor the dead on the southern wall, and 
Honor those who died for the cause on the 
north wall. The room contains no other 
treasures or clues, though plenty of tools 
(scissors, chisels, and brushes) still 
remain here from the room's embalming 
days. 

The painted bridge at the far side of the 
room is the Bridge of Sighs and Shadows, 
a magical link through solid rock between 
this room and the Divination Room. Only 
those who know its secret can cross it. 
The only creatures that still know the 
secret are the architect and the haunt 
Basarej (see The Architect's Chamber, Area 
34 and The Temple Ruins, page 27). They 
know the command word, Qantarat, that 
turns the image into an actual bridge, and 
the word Zill, that returns it to the Demi- 
plane of Shadow whence it came, The 
bridge lasts only 1 hour in any event. Any 
one in the Divination Room after that 
time is trapped there. 






























Even if the PCs summon the bridge 
correctly, they find it guarded by a pair of 
shadow elemental s who watch the bridge 
and prevent anyone but priests of Avani 
from crossing. The elementals attack all 
others as soon as they set foot on the 
bridge's black, tarry' timbers. 

Shadow elementals (2): AC 2: MV 
15; HD 12; hp 64, 55; THACO 9; 
#AT 1; Dmg 2d 12; SA chill touch; SD 
+2 or better weapon to hit; SW half 
damage in total darkness or full sun 
light; SZ L (12' tall); ML champion 
(16): Int low (5-7); AL N; XP 7,000. 

A shadow elemental has a 100% 
chance to hide in shadows. Its chill 
ing touch drains 2 points of Strength 
and 1 point of Constitution. These 
points are restored at a rate of 1 
point per hour. 

The bridge's connection to the Demi- 
plane of Shadow' means that creatures 
falling from the arches of the Chasm of 
Faith fall past this bridge and might catch 
themselves here (see Area 47). 

10. Divination Room: Beyond the Bridge 
of Shadows and Sighs lies this crou'ded 
room, filled with white, unlit candles, a 
copper divining bowl for reflecting pool 
spells, and a set of dragon bones for cast 
ing augury spells (worth 2,000 gp, given 
the rarity of dragons in Cerilia). Worship 
pers of Avani who cast divination spells in 
this room have an improved chance of 
success, so add +10% to any roll. 

The far wall of the room is decorated 
w'ith an alabaster arch of stone, but the 
archway' leads nowhere-it is made of 
solid rock. The archway is carved 
wdth passwords to open three dif 
ferent gatew ays to the outer 
planes, specifically Bytopia, 
Arcadia, and Mount 


Celestia. The passwords are Paradise, 
Balance , and Silverwater, But they acti 
vate the gate in the Chasm of Faith 
(Area 49). Speaking them here has no 
effect. Also, the priests plastered over 
the words to open passages to the Beast- 
lands. Elysium, and Mechanus (Circle, 
Plains, Gears), 

These passwords are the keys to the 
gate to paradise, the information the 
Three Brother Mages have sought for so 
long. They reward the PCs for the pass 
words alone, since they believe they know' 
the location of the gates. 

11. Servants' Chamber: The ashes of the 
order's servants are interred in this room. 
The spirits of many' of the servants remain 
here after death, and they act as invisible 
ghosts roughly equivalent to the unseen 
servant spell, Once they served as the link 
between the living and the dead at the 
feasts in the Feasting Hall (Area 8), but 
in recent centuries they have languished. 
Any knightly warrior can command their 
obedience within the tomb, though they 
cannot leave the tomb (they could, for 
instance, be commanded to remove the 
brown mold). They' can reach any point in 
the complex to convey messages or fetch 
small items. 

The western exit from this room is 
trapped. Anvone opening the door to the 
Warrior's Cfiamber (Area 12) must first 
unlock the door (-20% to Pick Lock 
chances). Even if the PCs pick the lock, 
they must survive the trap. Opening the 
door releases a cloud of poison gas (equiv 
alent to a cloudkill spell, but save vs. poi 
son rather than spell). The cloud affects 
the area shown on the map. 

12. Warrior's Chamber: The spirits of 
many warriors are bound to this room 
where their ashes were laid after they 
were cremated in the temple (Area 22). 
The 12 bravest knights of the order still 


¦b 


serve it in the afterlife. They resemble 
ancient knights, wearing green, corroded 
bronze plate armor and carrying shining 
scimitars. Beside the ghostly humans 
stands a ghostly halfling warrior in gleam 
ing chain armor, the eye symbol of the 
order on his buckler. 

Ghost warriors (12): AC 3; MV 12, 

FI 12; HD 4+3; hp 26. 25(x3), 24, 
23(x2), 21 (x2), 20. 18(x2); THACO 
17; #AT 1; Dmg ld8+chill for ld6; SA 
fear; SD flv, +1 or better weapon to 
hit; SZ M (6' tall); ML elite (14); Int 
average (9-10): AJL N; XP 650 each. 

Upon viewing ghost warriors for the 
first time, PCs must make a successful 
saving throw vs. paralyzation or be 
subject to fear. Flee at maximum 
movement rate, 50% chance of drop 
ping items. Fear lasts for 3d4 rounds. 

Ghost warriors cannot be turned 
because they are spirits, not undead. They 
have no connection to the Negative 
Energy Plane. 

The ghost warriors' treasure is 5,000 
sp, a smalt urn of oil of sharpness (3 appli 
cations), and a single suit of etven chain 
mail, sized for a halfling. 

The door leading to the Captains' Tomb 
(Area 13) is not locked or trapped. 

13. Captains' Tomb: The ashes of the 
captains of the order are kept here, and 
their deeds are recorded in the murals on 
the walls. Though most of the captains of 
Avani's legions have long departed, one 
captain's spirit remains to guard the cham 
ber against tomb robbers and defilers. 


























A pale, glowing warrior stands before 
you, left band held outstretched with 
the palm out, right hand on the pommel 
of an oddly curved sword. A setting sun 
is emblazoned on his breastplate. 

The ghost captain is a normal ghost 
with the following statistics. 

Ghost captain (ghost): AC 1; MV 
12. FI 24 (B); HD 6 + 3; hp 38; 
THACO 15; #AT 1; Dmg ld6 (touch) 
or 2d4 (khopesh sword); SA aging; 
SD +1 or better weapon to hit; SW 
turned as ghost: SZ M (6' tall); ML 
champion {15); Int very {11-12); AL 
LN; XP 2,000. 

A secret door connects this chamber to 
the captain-general's resting place. The 
obvious door and passage are a trap. Any 
one opening the door to the next chamber 
(Area 14) releases an enormous stone 
block from the ceiling that falls and 
crushes anything in the narrow corridor 
below. Anyone standing at the door must 
make a Dexterity check with a -A penalty 
for every 5 feet that they are inside the 
passage. Those standing at the door would 
receive a -12 penalty, for example, while 
those standing just within the passage 
would receive no penalty. 

PCs can avoid the trap by taking the 
secret passage behind a mural of a ceremo 
nial gate. The outline of the gate matches 
the outline of the door, which the PCs can 
open simply by pushing on the wall. 

14. Chamber of the Captain-Gen 
eral: The captain-general died 
an angry and bitter man 
watching the decline and 
fall of the Order of the 
Sun. He lingers out 
of a sense of 
duty and bit 
ter regret. 




He allows nothing and no one violate the 
sacred tomb and the grounds he swore to 
protect. However, he is confined to his 
chamber by a grave warding spell (see 
Spe/is of Reason , page 62). 

Ghost captain-general (spectre): 
AC 2; MV 15, FI 30 (B); HD 7+3; hp

age from holy water, destroyed by 
raise dead spell; SZ M (6' tall); ML 
champion (15); lnt high (13); AL LE; 
XP 3,000. 

The captain-general's chamber is lit 
tered with war trophies, musty old ban 
ners, a crude crown seized from a "prince'' 
of the Iron Peaks, a dwarven war trumpet, 
orog totems, the skull of a giant crocodile, 
and the breastplate of an Anuirean gen 
eral, taken at the Battle of the River 
Asarwe. If el-Mimar has been released 
(see Area 34), he may try to enlist the 
captain-general's services with a charm 
undead spell. 

15. Chamber of Falcons: Many of the 
knights of Avani's order were expert 
hunters and falconers, and many of the 
order's wizards w r ere granted hawks or fal 
cons as familiars. A dozen of these crea 
tures are buried here, embalmed, 
wrapped, and mummified. Each mummy 
lies on a small stone platform. If dis 
turbed, they rise up as animal skeletons. 

Undead hawks and falcons (ani 
mal zombies) (11): AC 8; MV 6; 
HD 1-1; bp 7{x3), 6. 5(x3), 4(x2), 

2, 1; THACO 15; #AT 3; Dmg 
1/1/ld4 (claw/claw/bite); SD edged 
or piercing weapons inflict half

cold-based spells; SW holy water 
inflicts 2d4 points damage; SZ S (5' 
wingspan); ML fearless (20); Int 
non (0); AL N; XF 65. 

Assorted scarabs, charms, and talismans 
in the skeletons' wrappings are worth 75 gp 
per skeleton, but gathering them requires a 
turn of unwrapping, poking, and searching. 
One mummy is protected by a grave ward 
ing and cannot be reanimated. 

16. Chamber of Hippogriffs: The female 
knights of Avani's order rode hippogriffs, 
several of which were loved well enough 
to merit burial in the Great Tomb. They 
were animated to protect the tomb 
against desecration. 

Six large creatures are buried in this 
room. They stand, horselike, but with 
folded, bandaged wings across their 
backs. As the door through which you 
entered creaks and begins to swing 
shut, you see sharp beaks and talons 
emerge from the wrappings of three of 
the creatures, along with the stench of 
long-rotted flesh. 

The three animated hippogriffs attack 
and their bandages slowly fall off, reveal 
ing withered, decayed flesh. The creaking 
door is just swinging on its hinges. No 
magical or mechanical force is shutting it.

The hippogriffs fight only to defend 
their room. They do not pursue 
intruders. They were buried with 
golden bits and bridles w r orth 400 gp 
each, but the PCs must slay the zom 
bies before claiming these treasures. 

17. Chamber of Griffons: The mummi 
fied griffons of the Marshalls of the Order 


are interred here, close to their riders. 
Even in death, they defend their masters. 

This room is /tiled witfc standing, com 
pletely -wrapped bodies, one in each 
comer. However, the bandages here are 
punctuated with threads of gold. All 
four of the horse-size creatures shift 
their heads suddenly in your direction, 
like hooded falcons turning toward the 
sound of prey. 

The griffons attack relentlessly. They 
fight until destroyed or until the PCs leave 
the room.

The griffons were buried with only 
the scarabs used in the enchant 
ments that animate them, These lapis 
lazuli talismans are worth 200 gp 
each and are hidden in their wrap 
pings. The cloth of gold is worth 40 
gp per griffon. 

The room's secret door is hidden in the 
chamber's stonework. The PCs can open 
it from this side only by stepping on a 
counterweight near the wall opposite the 
secret door. The architect built the secret 
tunnel so he could avoid the guardians of 
the rotunda (Area 18). 

18. Rotunda: The intersection of the two 
main halls on this level is a cir 
cular chamber with a domed 
ceiling. Arches lead out 
into the four passages, 
and a large statue 
dominates the center 
of the room. Four 
smaller statues 
support the pillars 
and arches. 


Three of the four supporting warrior stat 
ues are caryatid columns. The fourth is sim 
ply stone. All three golems have orders to 
attack any living creature leaving the 
rotunda. No matter from which direction 
the PCs enter, they can enter the rotunda 
safely. No matter bv which direction they 
leave, however, at least one column and per 
haps two will strike from behind, the others 
from the side (roll Id 10, surprise on 1-5). 

The statue in the center of the rotunda 
is a 10-foot-tall representation of 
Namaan el-Rammal, the founder of the 
order and father of the mage-king el- 
Arrasi. The greenish copper statue wields 
a scepter topped with an eye in one hand 
and a glowing sword in the other (contin 
ual light spell). However, it does not ani 
mate and fight.

variants) (3): AC 5; MV 6; HD 5; hp

fails; SZ M (7' tall); ML fearless (20); 

Int non (0); ALN;XP 420. 

The columns have no treasure. 
The statue of el-Rammal is worth a 
great deal to any regent among the 
Khinasi, but to transport it, the PCs 
need a large wagon and a team of 
oxen since it weighs more than 
2.800 pounds. 

The tunnels leading east and west from 
the rotunda are decorated with murals 
telling the story of the founding of the 
order, the discovery of how to train 
griffons, and the building of its 
various strongholds. Anyone 
who can read Khinasi (or a 
thief with a successful 
Read Languages roll) 
can read the titles 
of the various 


pieces; El-Rammal Founds the Glorious 
Order of the Sun, Captain-General el-Muffas 
Returns with Griffon Eggs, Architect Breaks 
Ground on the Great Totnb, and so on. The 
eastern hall is littered with discarded 
mango pits, banana peels, nutshells, and 
other refuse the Monkey King left when he 
stopped to eat on his way to the Chamber 
of the Ark-Royal (Area 53). He also 
defaced some of the murals, putting a 
mustache and horns on el-Rammal in 
Knighting the First Paladins of the Order of 
the Eternal Sun, 

19, Scriptorium: Filled with rickety 
writing desks and long-dried inkwells, 
the scriptorium is where the order's 
records were generated and copied. The 
room is now the haunt of an imp that 
seeks to take the soul of the architect, et- 
Mimar, for dabbling in necromancy. 
Unfortunately for the imp, el-Mimar 
wasn't dead yet when it arrived, and it 
isn't allowed back into the Nine Pits 
without his soul in hand. It's been wal 
lowing in self-pity for years. 

When the PCs arrive, the imp immedi 
ately sees the possibilities. It tries to con 
vince the PCs that el-Mimar deserves to 
die ("The Nine Princes wouldn't have sent 
me if he was a paragon of virtue, would 
they?"). If he is awakened, el-Mimar tries 
to silence the imp by killing it. 

Even more amusingly, the imp hangs 
around the party (invisibly if necessary') 
and offers them good advice for getting 
through the tomb. He helps by saying, 
Wear those amulets * they'll help you, and 
steering them toward his target's resting 
place in Area 34 by saying, I think you 
should go this way. Given the nature of the 
speaker, many PCs will assume that the 
imp is giving bad advice. However, for 
once he is telling the truth, but only 
because it is to his benefit.

Personality: Fawning, wheedling,

The imp has no treasure of its own, 
but its scrawled notes and drawings 
are useful to any student of the dia 
bolical baatezu (200 gp). 

20. Avani's Library: Like all places 
devoted to Avani and her servants, the 
Great Tomb contains a library*. This one is 
devoted to the records of those buried 
here, their deeds and histories, as well as 
Avani's sacred funeral texts, accounts of 
the costs of burial and construction, and a 
series of code books used in protecting 
the tomb's inner chambers. 

The stairs up to the librarian's quarters 
are trapped with a grease spell, courtesy of 
the imp in the Scriptorium. Anyone falling 
down the stairs suffers 2d6 points of dam 
age. The door at the top of the stairs has an 
excellent lock (-20% to Open Locks rolls). 

The passage leading to the treasury 
(Area 21) is trapped. If PCs open the door 
to the treasury, it releases the floor of the 
entire passage, dropping everyone standing 
on it into a 30-foot deep pit full of green 
slime. Only flying creatures 
and those able to grab a ledge or door han 
dle can avoid falling. 

Anyone caught in the slime is soon turned 
to green slime.

The PCs can find 10 moonstones 
(50 gp each), an amethyst (100 gp), 
and a topaz (500 gp) here. 


21. Treasure Chamber: The regular pas 
sage to this room is trapped {see Area 
20). The high priest always took the secret 
stairs down from his private quarters. 

The priests of Avani were very wealthy 
in their day, but because they collapsed 
the entrance to the tomb when the 
Anuireans took the Tower of the Eye, 
the treasury was never looted. The trea 
sure chamber contains three chests, four 
urns filled with coins, three maces lying 
upon a golden altar cloth, and a coffer 
lined with velvet. 

Chest #1 contains nothing but the 
accounts of the treasury, such as 
invoices and expenses, receipts, tallies, 
and tax records. 

Chest #2 is locked with a masterful 
lock (-60% to Open Locks rolls) and con 
tains the following forbidden wTitings: a 
libram of ineffable darkness. The Concordia 
Digitalis (a volume on making botanical 
poisons), and Eaters of the Dead (a volume 
on the use of ghouls in necromancy). 
None of these are usable (or saleable) by . 
good-aligned characters, of course. If the 
PCs have the key from the Monkey King, 
it opens the chest. 

Chest #3 is trapped with darts released 
when the PCs lift the lid. The darts fly out 
from the sides and top of the chest, strik 
ing all creatures within 10 feet of it with a 
THAC0 of 14. Any creature struck by a 
dart must make a saving throw vs. poison 
because the darts are covered with Type 
D poison (onset time ld2 rounds. 30 
points of damage, successful save for 2d6 
points of damage). The trap fires only 
once and does not reset itself, 

The chest contains el- 
Mimar's treasurv: 

8,000 gp, 12,000 sp, 
and letters of credit 
(now* worthless) 
drawn on Basarji 
trade houses 



1C 


4 



fektr 





for an additional 60,000 gp. 

The urns contain 4,000 cp, 14,000 sp, 
9,000 ep. and 9,000 gp. At the bottom of 
the urn of copper is an enormous ruby 
worth 5,000 gp. 

The three maces are not magical, but 
they are valuable. One is the Mace of the 
Grand Marshall of the Order of the Eter- 
nal Sun. a valuable relic of Khinasi knight 
hood and a vital item for any regent hop 
ing to reestablish the order. The second is 
the Mace of Avani, a ceremonial item long 
sought by the priests and priestesses of 
Avani for their rites. The third mace is the 
Blessed Mace of Latifa Min Avani, an 
early female paladin of the order (depicted 
in the murals in Area 18 and buried in the 
Chamber of Marshalls, Area 38). 

The open, velvet-lined coffer contains 
Eternal Rest , a magical mace that allows 
the wielder to turn undead as a 4th-level 
cleric. If the wielder is a priest, he can 
turn undead as if he were four levels 
higher. Though it provides its owner with 
no magical attack bonuses. Eternal Rest 
can strike creatures that must normally be 
struck by +3 or better weapons. 


22. Chamber of Fire: This large room 
was used for funeral services for the dead 
interred in the Great Tomb. Its magical 
fires have never gone out. 

This chamber is an enormous room 40 
feet in diameter, with a large glittering 
dome for a roof On either side of the 
entrance stands a falcon-headed statue, 
one male, one female. 

It seems that someone might live in this 
tomb after all. A fire pit bums before a 
large golden statue of a woman holding a 
scroll in one hand and the orb of the sun 
in the other. The statue's eyes are blazing 
red jewels that reflect the firelight. Two 
braziers stand before her. on either side of 
a bier where rests the body of a knight in 
plate armor, a scimitar in his hands, and 
a statue of a dog at his fee t. 



42 























Four large chandeliers hang from the 
chamber's roof on dark chains. They 
glow with bright light. Each arm of the 
chandeliers is worked from golden metal 
and resembles a ray of the sun. Two 
staircases lead up the circular walls to a 
door 20 feet above you. There are two 
balconies behind the statue. 

The haunt of the high priest outside in 
the temple can be laid to rest by giving 
burial to Yezeed el-Sams, the Khinasi 
warrior whose bones litter the bier in this 
chamber. However, the warrior's spirit 
has been tied to this place for so long 
without rest that it has gone mad, and it 
seeks to inflict that madness on anyone 
who enters the room. 

Spirit of madness: AC 0: MV 12;

Dmg 2d6 (chill) +drain Wisdom; SA

to hit; SZ M (6' tall); ML steady

3,000; new monster. 

The bier includes many grave goods, such 
as a +1 khopesh sword, a javelin of light 
ning, a suit of bronze plate armor +2, a + 1 
shield, and a necklace of survival. Taking 
any of these grave goods prevents the war 
rior's spirit from reaching its flnal rest and 
breaks any oath that the PCs may have 
sworn to the high priest Basarej. (See The 
Temple Ruins for the consequences.) 

Anyone who steals from the priests' 
quarters (Areas 21-30), from the statue 
of Avani. or from the body of Yezeed el- 
Sams animates the two golems that guard 
this chamber's entryway. Though the 
golems cannot climb the narrow stairs up 
to the priests' quarters, they do guard the 
exit from the Chamber of Fire (Area 22) 
and the exit from the Scriptorium (Area 
19) to prevent any thief from leaving with 
stolen goods.

The elemental spirit animating 
these golems is not tightly bound, 
resulting in a 1% cumulative chance 
per round of combat that it can break 
free of its orders. If it does, the golem 
becomes a berserker, attacking every 
thing in sight until destroyed. 

The high priest feared that el-Mimar 
or someone else would steal Avani's 
sacred treasures for some profane use, 
so he placed the golems here. A high 
priest of Avani (9th level or greater) or 
grand master paladin of Avani (11th 
level or higher) can command the golems 
to do his bidding. 

23. Pulpit: The priests of Avani read 
the eulogy for the dead from these bal 
conies. They are empty but still solid 
after all these years. There is no danger 
of collapse. 


43 



24. Vestry: The robes of the priests have 
long been tattered by time and eaten by 
moths. Among the remnants of once-fine 
robes is one holy symbol of Avani, a 
censer made of bronze, a ceramic lantern, 
a wick trimmer/candle snuffer, a tinder- 
box, and an amphora sealed with cork 
and wax containing holy oil, for the tem 
ple's lanterns. None of the items are 
exceptional. All were meant for day-to- 
day use, not for ornament. 

25. Sacred Items: The chalice, censers, 
braziers, and holy symbols of Avani are 
stored here. They are all of the finest gold, 

inlaid with stiver and set with chips of 
topaz {worth 3.000 gp total, but con 
secrated to a good deity). 

A cedar coffer Latched with 
bronze clasps contains a for 
tune in myrrh, sandal 
wood, and patchouli, 
and a small vial of 


attar of roses. Opening the coffer releases 
a gust of aromatic air that alerts the imp 
in the Scriptorium (Area 19). The incense 
and oil together are worth 3,000 gp. 

26. Underpriest's Quarters: Now' long 
abandoned, this room has only murals for 
furnishings. The images on the walls show 
the temple rites of Avani, the gates to par 
adise, and the road to enlightenment 
through study, teaching, and reason. 

27. Librarian's Quarters: This chamber 
is still neatly organized, with a volume 
on a reading stand near the southern 
door, a small shelf of scrolls beside an 
empty bed frame, and a wardrobe and 
mirror against the western wall. The 
wooden furniture is oddly eaten away, 
almost as if scarred by fire. 

The book on the stand is titled The 
Logic of Glyphs: A Primer on Warding Mag 
ics and their Application. It contains all the 
priest spells in the Spel/s of Reason appen 
dix, including the names of glyphs, 
required to deactivate them. However, the 
entire text is written in Khinasi script. No 
one else can read it. 

The right door on the north wall is a 
trap. When the PCs open it, it releases a 
cloud of acidic gas. Those in the room 
must successfully save vs. poison or suffer 
3d4 points of damage from the gas (no 
damage if save successful). Equipment 
(including the book and the scrolls) must 
make a successful item saving throw vs. 
acid with a +3 bonus or be destroyed. The 
trap can reset itself twice and has already 
destroyed most of what was in the room. 

The door dow n to the library is locked 
with an excellent lock (-20% to the Open 
Locks roll). The key was kept in this room. 

28. Chanter's Quarters: On the walls are 
the hymns and sacraments of Avani, w rit 
ten in a clear, bold hand with the musical 
notation for accompanying chants and 
responses. 




29. High Priest's Quarters: 

The walls of this room are covered with 
wooden panels, reddish-brown and 
cawed in many small panels with figures 
of the Cerilian gods, including Avani's 
Palace of the Sun. Other panels show 
kawesting, monks copying manuscripts, 
peasants sowing crops, hunters in the 
forests, and a shepherd driving off a wolf. 

The panels are well-rendered. but are 
probably too heavy for the PCs to bother 
dragging along with them. 

The high priest liked to keep a few 
secrets from his subordinates, such as the 
two secret doors. The first secret door 
leads down to the treasury. It is well-hid 
den in the room's panelling. 

The second secret door is an entire 
panel that swings out and leads to a set of 
stairs to the Upper Chambers, avoiding 
the traps of the Hall of Force (Area 37) 
and leading directly to the Chamber of 
Marshalls (Area 38). The stairs are pro 
tected by a glyph of sunlight and a snare 
that can trap a PC for 6 hours. 

30. Consort's Quarters: In the center of 
this chamber is a large marble bath, carved 
and smoothed stone, filled with water that 
drips from the ceiling. The marble is 
slightly discolored, greenish with some 
mineral from the dripping water. The bath 
is home to a water weird summoned here 
by el-Mimar.

Those hit must make a successful 
saving throw vs. paralyzation or be 
pulled into the water, Each round in 
the water requires another successful 
saving throw. Failure means drowning. 

If reduced to 0 hp or less, a water 
weird is disrupted and it reforms in 2 
rounds. 

The weird's treasure is all kept in the 
bath's waters: 900 gp, seven moonstones 
(50 gp each), three heavy' golden anklets 
(800 gp each), and a pair of earrings (600 
gp the pair). 

31. Wemic Burial Chamber: The great 
lionlike servants of the order who brought 
the word of Avani into the wide plains and 
hinterlands of the Sun Coast were buried 
here. They were three of the greatest 
shamans of Avani and three of the greatest 
knights of the order. 

The wemics no longer rest peacefully. 
El-Mimar made them monster zombies to 
guard his final resting place against all 
those who might despoil his tomb's wealth.

The giants were buried with their valu 
ables, including their stone clubs, 7,000 sp, 
2,500 gp, a gold amulet of Avani worth 300 
gp, and a giant-sized silver bracer inscribed 
with the figures of the sun, masons working, 
and sleeping lions, worth 1,000 gp. 

33. Mason's Chamber; The passage to this 
room is open, hut dusty. No one has passed 
this way for a long time. The Great Tomb's 
master mason and stone carver was laid to 
rest here, in an elaborately carved sarcoph 
agus decorated with vines, a hammer, 
chisel, circle, and plumb line. If the PCs 
open the sarcophagus, a trap is triggered 
that drops a 12-ton block of stone onto the 
5-by-5-foot entrvway, sealing it. 

Within the sarcophagus are the mason's 
hones, tools, and a gold amulet of Avani 
(worth 300 gp). This amulet is useful in the 
Chamber of the Ark-Royal (Area 53), and 
to its wearer it gives magical power over the 
golems in the halls (Areas 6. IS, and 22). 

34. Architect's Chamber; The door to 
this chamber is protected by a glyph of 
sunlight and a grave warding spell (see The 


32. Giants' Chamber; Three stone giants 
rest here on huge stone biers. They were 
magically preserved while still alive and 
can be restored to life by a transmute stone 
to flesh spell or a successful dispel magic 
against a 12th-level caster. All the giants 
show marks on their necks where their life 
force has been bled away bv the vampire 
el-Huffas (Area 38).

Spells of the Cfcimaeron). Though the 
wards were put here at the occupant's 
request, the priests considered them as 
much a protection from what lay within as 
a defense against forces from outside. 

Part of the architect's fee for designing 
and supervising the construction of the 
order's great tomb complex was a burial 
chamber for himself. He rests here still, 
and he's still alive. 

El-Mimar's plan was simple. He intended 
to prolong his life as long as he could and 
meanwhile create undead in the tomb's var 
ious crypts. When his time came, he would 
ingest the proper magical mixture, return 
from the sleep of the dead as a lich, and 
bring his servants out of their stony prisons. 
Unfortunately, the two thieves he hired to 
wake him were slain by the tomb's 
guardians, and he has slumbered for much 
longer than he had planned. Also, the trans 
formation to lich state never occurred,

El-Mimar will be drained of life 
energy by the vampire of the tomb 
(Area 38) if the protection from evil 
warding his tomb is ever broken. 


35, Secret Workshop: This is where the 
architect Djuhah ei-Mimar brewed his 
potions and learned magic. His notebooks 
reveal that the object of his research was 
extended life. The Chimera will be inter 
ested in his notebooks and offers 2 GB for 
them, but few other buyers are interested 
in the notes of a failed experiment. 

The workshop isn't entirely empty. The 
architect's homonculus still lives here, 
unable to die while its maker yet lives and 
powerless to receive any new orders. It 
tries to befriend anyone who enters the 
lab, warning them about the dangers of 
freeing the invisible stalker or entering its 
circle , It especially wants solid food, as it 



has sustained itself by using a Murlynd's 
spoon for decades now, and the taste of 
cardboard-flavored gruel has grown intol 
erably boring.

It gives no sign of its presence at first,

The bones of el-Mimar's last familiar, a 
hawk, lie on one of the workbenches, 
embalmed and wrapped, 

the upper 
chambers 

" wm eserved for the exclusive use of the 
¦Jc priesthood and paladins of Avani, 
JL jLthe upper burial chambers of the 
Great Tomb were carved out of the 
region's stone just as the lesser chambers 
were, using transmute rock to mud spells to 
simplify the work. The halls are all lit vrith 
continual light spells, and the floors are 






inlaid with white ceramic tiles or grayish 
white flagstones. The ceilings here are 
only 8 feet high. There are no random 
encounters unless the PCs or el-Mimar 
free some of the monsters from their 
imprisonment to roam the halls. 

36. Hall of Offerings: As with the entrance 
hall (Area 1), this room is a place where 
offerings were left by the priests for the 
order's leaders, who were all buried in the 
upper chambers. Unlike the entrance hall, 
this room hasn't been despoiled by 
humanoids. The ancestor statues and small 
offering shrines are all still intact. There are 
16 small statues here, one for each mar 
shall, one for the founder, and four for the 
high priests of the order. The room is illumi 
nated by continual light spells. 

Four statues watch over the two exits 
from this room. The two to the east are a 
male paladin and his griffon. The two stat 
ues to the south are a female priestess and 
her hippogriff. None of the statues are 
magical constructs. 

37. Hall of Force: This empty hall is pro 
tected by two traps, one mechanical and 
one magical. 

The first trap is the mechanical one, a pit 
just inside the hall's entrance that drops 
anyone stepping onto it into a chute that 
slides them slightly west and down to the 
first level, where they fall into the green 
slime pit between the library and the trea 
sury (Areas 20 and 21). 

The second trap is a force-spear trap 
that projects hundreds of thin rays of 
magical force through the 10-foot-wide 
hall. The force-spear trap can be detected 
by a detect magic, true seeing, detect traps, 
or find traps spell, but is invisible to nor 
mal sight (a thief's detect traps ability can 
not find it). It inflicts 4d6 points of dam 
age on everyone in the hall (successful 


save vs. spell for half damage), and forces 
a saving throw vs. crushing blow' for those 
who fail the saving throw. It can be dis 
armed by speaking the password, 
Hudanat , as the PCs might ha\'e learned 
from the priest-haunt in the temple. 

38. Chamber of Marshalls: All tire Grand 
Marshalls of the Order are buried here, 
under great stone slabs along the edges of 
the great circular burial chamber. 

A large archway before you leads into 
a huge, 60-foot diameter room. A sin 
gle word is inscribed at the top of the 
archway. The archway is flanked by 
two pillars, and the ceiling is covered 
with mosaics of armies marching 
behind the generals. 

A dozen or so slabs of stone set into 
the floor seem to be grave markers, each 
cari'ed with the image of a knight. In 
the center of the room is a row of pillars 
the color of ox-blood, and between 
them, a jitie, intricate carpet running 
the length of the room. At the north end 
of the chamber is an altar flanked by 
two more pillars and two enormous. 8- 
foot-tall g old candlesticks. 

Beyond the pillars, directly opposite 
your entrance, is another archway lead 
ing out, 

The inscription over the door is the 
command word for two figurines of won 
drous power in the chamber, one resting on 
slab C and one on slab H. The figurines 
are golden lions that become normal adult 
lions when the command word 


49 


is spoken. If the command word is spoken 
a second time, they return to their statue 
form. Otherwise, they attack.

both front claws hit; SD surprised only 
on a 1; SZ M (6' long); ML fearless 
(20); Int semi (2-1); AL N; XP 650. 

If slain in combat, the lions cannot 
be brought back from statue form for 
one week. Otherwise, they can be 
used once every day. 

The marshalls are buried beneath the 
stone slabs marked A-K. However, after 
el-Mimar was buried, each of the slabs 
was marked with a glyph of sunlight, a type 
of glyph of warding unique to Avani's 
priests that causes 9d4 points of damage 
to the opener (successful save for half), 
and creates a blast of tight in the chamber 
equal to full sunlight for a moment (as per 
the 9th-level 5unray spell). 

Before the glyphs were placed, though, 
el-Mimar worked his necromantic arts on 


the marshalls' remains to create more ser 
vants for himself. The first two bodies were 
too decayed to transform and el-Mimar did 
n't find a body under slab I (because the 
occupant was out feeding), but those 
beneath slabs C-K were made into wights. 
The wights have been trapped beneath their 
slabs for centuries because el-Mimar never 
woke, and thus never freed them. They are 
hopelessly insane, and attack anyone who 
frees them (other than their master).

Wights avoid sunlight but are not 
harmed by it. 

The marshalls each wear an amulet 
of Avani. These amulets are useful in 
the Reflecting Passageways (Area 
41) or Hall of Mirrors (Area 42), 

39. Hall of Stone: The stones of this hall 
way animate to prevent intruders from pass 
ing through, for this passage is guarded by a 
loyal galeb duhr who was long ago enticed 
into serving the order. It uses its magic to 
prevent intruders from entering the Cham 
ber of the Marshalls without being accom 
panied by a member of the order.

shape at will. 

Crusher can animate boulders within 
60 yards. The animated boulders are 
AC 0. MV 3. HD 9, hp 55. 41, 40. 
Dmg 4d6. 

Personality: Slow and deliberate, 
motherly. 

The galeb duhr has a small collec 
tion of gems, including a topaz (500 
gp), a flawed emerald (1,000 gp), 
two chunks of amber from the north- 
lands (100 gp each), three green 
chrysoprase (50 gp each), and a 
vibrant purple ioun stone (stores 5 
levels of spells) that might be mis 
taken for an amethyst. 

40. Hall of Spears: 

In the hall is a grisly sight, a sort of hedge 
made of spears, skulls, and human bones. It 
seems to be rustling in some invisible wind. 







51 















































This Hall of Spears is a magical trap. 
Anyone approaching within 10 feet of the 
wall is attacked by its enchanted spears, 
with the same effects as a wall of swords 
spell. The spell's victims become part of its 
substance, absorbed by the spell to fight 
against the next victims. 

Though the PCs can fight their way 
through the wall of spears, they might 
not find the entrance to the Chamber of 
Flowers because the wall obscures it 
unless it is utterly destroyed. The 
entrance to that chamber is clogged by a 
mass of bones and metal. The easier pas- 
sage through the area is through the 
northern section of the wall. 

If the PCs fight their way past the 
magical wall, a short passage leads to the 
Chamber of Flowers. The room centers 
on four pillars oflight bluish stone, and 
colorful mosaics decorate the four walls 
with roses, flowering vines, and bright 
orange fire lilies. 

In the center of the room is a chalice 
of silvery-gold. Once per month, any liq 
uid placed in the chalice becomes a 
potion of healing. 

41. Reflecting Passageways: These two 
passages both end in mirrors that are 
actually complicated illusions and tele 
portation devices. Anyone entering either 
hall is magically turned around, exiting 
the passage exactly where they entered 
it, despite all efforts to pass down the 
hall. The only way through is by either 
wearing an amulet of Avani (from Areas 
32, 33. and 38) or by casting a success 
ful knock or dispel magic spell against a 
14th-level caster, A knock is effective for 

10 rounds, and a dispel magic for one 
hour. A wand of negation allows free 
passage for ld4+4 rounds. 


42. Hall of Mirrors: Once through the 
Reflecting Passages (Area 41). there is 
another mirrored room. 

The PCs can enter the mirrors with a 
knock spell, dispel magic, wand of negation, 
or an amulet of Avarn'. Once entered, no 
speech or vision can penetrate to reach 
creatures on the far side, though occasion 
ally a glimpse of a creature is visible on 
the Hall of Mirrors side. 

When describing this room, do not use 
compass directions. Indicate right and left, 
and use terms like "directly across" or "diag 
onally across," but let the players keep track 
of where they have already been. The corri 
dors beyond are enchanted to appear to con 
tinue for some distance, and the enchanted 
mirrors are meant to confuse visitors. 

43. Crypt of the Martyrs: The order has 
many icons and mosaics of its greatest 
heroes here, the knights who were legends 
to the cities they championed. 

On the lintel above the doorway is 
carved a clue to the location of the Ark- 
Royal and the sword: Between the sun and 
the abyss, between the eye and the mirror, 
lies the foundation of the order. It implies 
that the Ark-Royal lies between areas 45 
and 49. and between 42 and 48. 

44. Infinite Passageway: Anyone enter 
ing this mirror enters a passage that 
seems to stretch for hundreds of yards, 
though a light is dimly visible at the end 
of the tunnel. The light is a captured will- 
o-the-wisp, kept here to lure tomb rob 
bers to their doom.

runestone (30 gp), a miniature songbird 
worked in gold, emeralds, and jacinth 
(2,000 gp), a signet ring of the Royal 
Guild of Baruk-Azhik trading coster (800 
gp), a potion of growth , a staff-mace, and a 
wand of lightning (18 charges), 

45, Chamber of the Sun: 

This room shines with blinding white 
light . At the far end of the room is an 
archway of elaborately worked gold. 
Floating in the archway is a large 
round stone. 

The light in this room is the equivalent 
of the sunlight spell. The room is protected 
by a guardian, an undead beholder cap 
tured and kept here through the use of a 
trap the soul spell. If the PCs enter the 
room, a trap is set off that releases the 
stone, which crushes the gem containing 
the guardian.

The beholder guards a wand of illumina 
tion (43 charges) and a hoard of 10,000 
sp, 4,000 gp, and 300 ep, 

46. The Tilting Hall; This hallway is a 
carefully-balanced seesaw, with the axis 
marked by the line in the center of the hall. 
Anyone walking in the section nearest the 
hall of mirrors is supported by a ledge that 
keeps that end of the hall from tilting. 
Once past the center point, the whole hall 
tilts down. A counterweight restores the 
trap's position when the victims fall off the 
far end and into the 30-foot-deep pit below, 

In the bottom of the pit. a juju zombie 
awaits its prey. It wants fresh, bloody meat. 

Juju zombie (zombie): AC 6; MV 9; 
HD 3+12; hp 23; THAC0 15; #AT 1; 
Dmg 3d4; SD +1 or better weapon 
required to hit, blunt or piercing 
weapons cause half damage, climb

to mind-affecting spells and psionics, 
illusions, electricity, and magic mis 
siles; SZ M; ML fearless (19); Int low 
(7); AL NE; XP 975. 

The zombie is the victim of the trap in 
the hall next door (Area 47). 

47. Juju Gas: This hall is trapped with a 
magical trigger. When two or more crea 
tures enter, a wall of swords spell grows out 
of the floor and seals the exit to the Hall 
of Mirrors (Area 42). Anyone trying to 
pass through suffers the usual damage 
(see The Spells of the 

Chimaeron). Simultane 
ously. the trap 
releases a magi 
cal gas, a 





>jj & 


pale yellow, slightly bitter mist that floods 
the hall. Invented by el-Mimar, the juju 
gas affects everyone who fails a saving 
throw vs. spell. Any PC affected by the 
gas acts normally, until the affected PC 
dies, when he is immediately reborn as a 
juju zombie, eager to wreak havoc on 
other party members. The PCs must either 
find out the hard way, or use spells such as 
identify (on a container of the gas), true 
seeing (reveals only an odd yellow glow to 
the victim's eyes), divination (counsels the 
victim to get priestly help), or commune 
(explains the exact nature of the gas and its 
effects, if successful), A remove curse or a 
heal spell cast by a lOth-level or higher 
priest removes the effect, but dispel magic 
does not. 

48. Chamber of the All-Seeing Eye: This 
is where many of the order's rituals were 
carried out. Knights were initiated here, 
vigils were held by both warriors and 
priests, and wizards practiced their skills 
at divination and scrying. It is magically 
warded against interference. 

Anyone wearing the amulets from the 
Giants* Chamber (Area 32), Master 
Mason (Area 33), or one of the Marshalls' 
(Area 38) is immune to the effects of this 
chamber's magical trap. Anyone who enters 
the room without wearing an amulet trig 
gers a prismatic spray from the great eye in 
the archway over the entrance. The seven 
colored beams of the spell flicker and strike 
every corner of the room, Roll ld8 and 
consult the table listed in the 7th-level wiz 
ard spell prismatic spray in the PHB to 
see how each character is affected. 


When the PCs recover, read: 

This chamber is dominated by a great, 
four-sided pyramid. Steep stone stairs 
lead up to the platform at the top on 
every face of the pyramid, though the 
stones on one side are darkly stained. At 
the top of the pyramid is a great crystal, 
emitting a pale green light and pulsing 
gently. A 4-foot-diameter globe seems to 
be circling the top of the pyramid. 

The small circling globe is a guardian 
spectator, placed here to prevent anyone 
but the priests of Avani from using the 
room's magical item. The priests are 
gone, but the spectator still carries out 
its duties.

MV FI 9 (B); HD 4+4; hp 24; THACO 
15; #AT 1; Dmg ld4+l; SA magic; 
SD magic, reflects one spell/round

successful saving throw, +1 to initia 
tive, +2 to surprise; MR 5%: SZ M (4' 
diameter); ML elite (14); Int high

Ike spectator's eyes can create food 
and water, cause serious wounds to 
180' away, paralyze to 90' away for 
8d4 rounds, telepathy to 120' with a 
single target and may implant sugges 
tion if target fails save. 

Personality: Stickler for rules, 
inflexible. 

If the PCs make it to the top of the 
pyramid, they find the small platform 
there cluttered with bones, hits of armor, 
weapons, and tattered cloth-the 
remains of those captivated by the power 
of Avani's Eye. However, the mesmeriz 
ing pull of the Eye affects everyone 
within 10 feet of it immediately, includ 
ing those on the platform and those 


more than halfway up the stairs that are 
in sight of the Eye, 

The great crystal at the top of the pyra 
mid is the Eye of Avani, a powerful scrying 
device that allows the user to receive the 
equivalent of one commune spell once per 
day. However, for those who are not wise 
high priests of the goddess, the effect is 
less beneficial. Any creature who stands 
on the platform and has less than 17 Wis 
dom cannot tear its gaze away from the 
Eye. The creature will literally stand there, 
staring, until it dies of thirst (typically, 
about three days later). 

Even those who are wise enough to tear 
their gaze away from the Eye may be 
harmed by it, for the Eye reveals more 
than most men were meant to know about 
the gods, the world, and the forces of evil 
and ignorance that the order opposed. 
Since the Eye reveals all the knowledge of 
the Temple of Avani, the viewer may be 
driven insane. Anyone who watches the 
Eye for more than 1 hour gains a commune 
spell with Avani, and must roll percentile 
dice (as per contact other plane to avoid 
insanity) and consult the table in the 5 th- 
level wizard spell contact other plane, listed 
in the PHB. 

49. Chasm of Faith: Like the bridge to 
the divination chamber (Area 9), this 
chamber is connected to the Demiplane of 
Shadow, the Shadow World. Though the 
chasm is like the one below the Bridge of 
Shadows, the room itself contains four 
arches, all leading to a shining pillar in the 
center of the room. The small circular 
ledge at the entrance to the chamber has 
no railing and no protection irom the 
strong winds that blow from below. Some 
words are inscribed in the ledge's stone 
floor in a silvery script: 

Where I rise, seek to ascend. 

Where 1 fall, seek to depart. 

Where winter lingers, 

seek the solace of wisdom, 

Where summer shines, seek the 
glory of war. 



55 































The short verse is a description of the 
chasm's contents, based on the image of 
the sun. Where the sun rises (east) is the 
gate to the Upper Planes (ascending), 
where it sets (west) is the exit. Winter 
comes when the sun lingers in the south, 
so the library is in the south, and summer 
comes when the sun is high is the north 
ern sky, so the armory is in the north. 
The verse is to remind visitors where they 
are going, for crossing the chasm is not 
an easy task. 

The first danger facing anyone leaving 
the platform and entering the chasm is the 
wind. Each round that a creature spends 
on the arches requires a Dexterity check 
(if walking) or a Strength check with a +3 
bonus (if crawling). Any creature that fails 
one check is blown to the very edge of the 
chasm. Failing a second check means the 
creature has been swept off the arch. The 
winds can be stopped by the 5th-level 
priest spell, control winds. 

The second danger is that any creature 
venturing out onto the arches is attacked 
by the flying creatures native to the cham 
ber. a mass of gloomwing moths that 
swarm to any source of light. Characters, 
walking out in darkness need fight off only 
a single gloomwing, but they run the risk 
of making a fatal misstep (and they won't 
see the sun at the centerpoint).

The moth's shimmering wings con 
fuse any creature for ld4+4 rounds 
that fails a save vs. spell (as 4th-level 
wizard spell). The moth is 50% unde 
tectable because of camouflage. 
When attacking in darkness or near 
darkness, the gloomwing gains a -2 
bonus to its surprise roll. 

Swooping gains a +2 to attack. 
During the second and each succes 
sive round of combat, pheromones 
cause weakness in a 25' radius. 
Exposed creatures must make a suc 
cessful saving throw vs. poison or 
lose 1 point of Strength each round 
they remain in the area of effect. 
Creatures with a successful initial 
save need not save again if exposure 
continues. Multiple gloomwings do 
not require multiple saves. Strength 
returns 1 point per turn. Id4 hours 
after exposure stops. 

Anyone falling into the chasm passes 
by the Bridge of Shadows before plum 
meting forever into the half-darkness of 
the demiplane. A successful Dexterity 
ability check allows the falling creature 
to grab the bridge. 

The center of the arches is decorated 
with an inlaid mosaic sun of bright tiles of 
orange and yellow. Anyone standing on 
the sun may dispel the gloomwings to 
their home plane and.command the gar 
goyle golem in Area 51 to do his bidding. 

Crdatures attempting to fly by magi 
cal means can be hit by the wand of nega 
tion w'ielded by the gargoyle golem in the 
Vault of Knowledge (Area 51). The gar 
goyle golem will leap out to the attack if 
the gloomwings are all slain and PCs are 
heading south to the library it is sworn 
to protect. 

50. Armor of God: Here the order kept 
its best armor and weapons. The room 
now contains a solid heartwood chest 
secured by copper hands, an iron casket, 
and a large trunk of leather over oak, with 
rusted iron fittings. 

Hidden in the casket is the griffon 
amulet, a magical talisman that allows the 
wearer to cast charm monster on griffons, 


56 


hippogriffs, and eagles once per week. The 
wearer also gains the animal training and 
riding and airborne nonweapon proficien 
cies while wearing the amulet. 

The trunk is trapped with a scything 
blade that sweeps out to take off the hand 
of anyone who reaches into the chest 
(avoid with a successful saving throw vs. 
poison: suffer ld8 points of damage). 
These treasures include a magnificently 
worked set of bronze plate armor +2, a 
large shield +3 called Lifeshielder that acts 
as a magic jar spell, taking in the wielder's 
life force when he is slain, a great helm +1 
(as a ring of protection) and a set of bracers 
of swimming and climbing. 

The locked oak chest also contains trea 
sures and a trap. It is protected by a sym 
bol of discord, triggered when the lock is 
picked successfully. There is a 50% chance 
that PCs of different alignments attack 
each other over the division of the spoils 
inside the chest. The chest contains a 
matched set of silver throwing daggers 
(400 gp), an elaborate silver salt cellar 
(3,000 gp, 2 feet tall), and a chessboard 
and chess pieces made of ivory and black 
jade, worth a total of 8,500 gp. 

51. Vault of Knowledge: All the scrolls, 
tomes, and maps once kept here have 
been moved to other strongholds of Avani 
by her loyal priests. However, the cham 
ber's bookshelves and scroll racks are still 
in place, and a few items belonging to el- 
Mimar are still stored here, including his 
spell books. 


The vault is defended by a gargoyle 
golem wielding a wand of negation (86 
charges) that it uses to dispel the enchant 
ments on any creature that flies in the 
chasm or that walks from the centerpoint 
toward the vault. The beam is pale gray 
and is difficult to see in darkness or light, 

Gargoyle golem: AC 0; MV 9 (leap 
up to 100 ); HD 15; hp 60; THAC0 
5; #AT 2: Dmg 3d6/3d6 (claw/claw); 
SA surprise leap inflicts 4dl0 and 
item saves vs. crushing blow, if hit by 
both claws in any round victim must 
make a successful saving throw vs. 
petrification or be turned to stone; 
SD -2 bonus to surprise foes; SW 
earthquake spell instantly shatters the 
golem without affecting surrounding 
region, transmute rock to mud inflicts 
2d 10 points of damage; SZ M (6' 
tall); ML fearless (20); Int non (0): 
AL N; XP 14,000. 

During the round after a gargoyle 
golem has petrified a victim, it will 
attack that same target again. Any hit 
scored by the golem against such a 
foe indicates that the stone body has 
shattered and cannot be resurrected. 

The vault also contains a w and of earth 
and stone (10 charges), a scarab vs. golems, 
and a scroll of disintegrate, shatter, and 
clairattdience (cast at 16th level), all 
belonging to the architect. 

52, The Mirror Gate: This archway 
seems sealed with a mirrored surface. 








the sword of 
roele 

T he sword carried by Michael Roele 
is a heavy, well-used blade, forged 
by the dwarves of Baruk-Azhik as 
a gift for the Attuirean Emperor upon his 
ascension to the throne. It is made in the 
heavier, slightly more barbaric style of 
500 years ago. 

Though the hilt is decorated with 
braided gold and silver leading to a 
carved golden pommel, it is clearly a 
blade meant for battle. Two small red gar 
nets are set where the hilt meets the cross 
piece in the form of a bearded dwarven 
face. to sc I've as the blade s "eyes these 
stones glow when wielded in battle by a 
scion of the Roele bloodline. 

Any bard who makes a successful lore 
roll knows the story of the blade of 
Michael Roele. The sword was broken in 
two by the Gorgon during Roele's final 
combat with the amisbegh, but the blade 
is still faintly magical. Both the Lord 
High Chamberlain, Acdan Dosiere, and 
Gylvain Aurealis, an elven courtier and 
warrior, were witnesses to Michaele 
Roele's death, and their stories both say 
the blade was broken by the Gorgon's 
powerful swordplay. 

The Sword of Roele is a +2 weapon, 
with the special power of detecting evil 
once per day. It functiotis only for blooded 
characters. 






Around the edge of the portal are symbols 
resembling a mountain, an animal, a great 
gear, a rainbow, a shining star, and an 
hourglass. These symbols of the planes 
show j the possible destinations of this 
gate, though it was rarely used. The need 
had to be very great for the order's mar 
shalls to summon aid from the Upper 
Planes to help in their battles. 

The portal is a solid and unyielding sur 
face until one of the proper passwords is 
spoken before it. As soon as the word is 
uttered, the mirror quivers for a moment 
and assumes the color of the chosen desti 
nation: silver for Mount Celestia, gray for 
Arcadia, gold for Bytopia, white for Ely 
sium, rust-brown for Mechanus, and 
green for the Beastlands. Once activated, 
the portal remains active for a single day. 
Thereafter, anyone passing through is 
trapped on the other side. 

53. The Chamber of the Ark-Royal: This 
entire room is protected by a forbiddance 
spell that was cast by a 14th-level lawTul 
neutral priest. Lawful neutral PCs can 
enter without penalty, nonlaw'ful PCs 
must successfully save vs. spell to enter or 
suffer 2d6 points of damage, and good or 
evil-aligned PCs must successfully save vs. 
spell or suffer 4d6 points of damage. Only 
a higher level caster can dispel this spell. 
Once a PC fails a save, it cannot enter the 
region. Even if the save is successful, 
intruders feel uneasy and tense. 

At the center of the room is a sarcophagus 
with the statue of a knight in full armor 
on its lid. The knight wears a croivu and 
holds a glowing sword in his hands. 


58 









A successful use of the heraldry non 
weapon proficiency or a bard's lore roll 
will indicate that this is not the tomb of 
Michael Roele, but the resting place of 
Namaan el-Rammal, the father of el- 
Arrasi, the savior of the Khinasi. El-Ram 
mal was perhaps Avani's greatest paladin. 
He was a powerful warrior, a devoted wor 
shipper of Avani. and a great soothsayer. 
The statue here resembles the statue in 
the intersection of corridors downstairs 
(Area 18), but it show's him much aged, 
as he was at the time of his death, 

El-Rammal's tomb is the order's holiest. 
Inside the stone coffin is a golden ark con 
taining the bones of its patron, the Shin 
ing Knight of Eternal Sun. the prince of 
the royal house who founded the order. 
El-Rammal still defends the Great Tomb 
after all these centuries. If his shrine or 
resting place is disturbed, his spirit returns 
to animate his body and drive off the 
impious grave-robbers (the animated 
remains are treated as a skeleton warrior). 
The ark also contains the two shards of 
the sword of Michael Roele (see The Sword 
of Roele). To take the sword, the PCs must 
open the ark and defeat the righteously 
enraged spirit of the Shining Knight. Any 
one wearing an amulet o f Avani can take 
the sword if al-Rammal deems him wor 
thy. He asks (in Khinasi), "Who dares take 
the blade from the tomb of the order?" 
Unless the answer is spoken in Khinasi, 
al-Rammal attacks. If the answer is in 
Anuirean. he attacks with +2 to all attack 
and damage rolls. 

Prince al-Rammal, undead Khinasi 
male (skeleton warrior): AC 2 
(bronze plate armor and shield +1); 
MV 6; HD 9+12; hp 67; THACO 11 
(wdth scimitar); #AT 3/2; Dmg ld8+2 
(scimitar); SA sight of warrior causes 
creature with fewer than 5 HD to flee 
in panic; SD cannot be turned fay 
priest; SW cannot attack true follow 
ers of Avani. must engage in honor 
able combat; MR 90%; SZ M; ML

S 16, D 13, C 16,1 14, W 14, Ch 18. 
Personality: Proud, pious, and 
determined. 

Special Equipment: shield + 1, 
scimitar of quickness +2, helm of 
underwater action 

If el-Rammal is defeated or answered, 
he gives up his possession of his old body, 
which collapses like the frail skeleton it is. 
Any priest or w'orshipper of Avani who 
restores the bones to their proper resting 
place in the ark deserves a 4,000 XP 
bonus experience award.

concluding the 
adventure 


T he adventure ends when the PCs 
either side with the Brothers and 
tell them how to reach Elysium 
through the gates in the Chamber of 
Shadows or the Chamber of the Ark- 
Rovah or when they recover the Sword of 
Roele and bargain with the Monkey King. 

If the PCs help the Brother Mages, the 
Mages offer the PCs their choice of wealth 
or magic for information about how to 
reach the gate. If the PCs choose wealth, 
they are 
given the 
remains of 
the Three 
Brothers' 
treasury: 10 
GB. If they 
choose 
magic, they 

are given access to the new r spells in the 
Brothers' spellbooks, and nonspellcasters 
each gain one magical item from Brothers' 
stock. If the PCs have been especially 
helpful (providing an escort to the gate, 
slaying the Chimera and not claiming her 
sources, or revealing the presence and 
actions of the Monkey King, for example), 
the Brother Mages might even offer to 
invest their bloodline into a deserving 
scion or unblooded PC. 

If the PCs help the Chimera by track 
ing down and slaying the Three Brother 
Mages, they are richly rewarded. She 
spends a Domain Action concluding a 
treaty with the PCs, offering the Chi- 
maeron's aid in the form of either her 
(admittedly meager) troops or her magic 
at some future date. Whether she keeps to 
this agreement is another matter entirely. 

If the PCs hold onto the Sword of Roele, 
they deserve a 20,000 XP award. 


further 

adventures 


N o matter who the PCs decide to help, 
the Sword of Roele is a source of 
many further adventures and much 
political chaos. The Gorgon will attempt 
anything-assassinations, invasions, and 

missions by 
powerful guild 
thieves-to get 
the sword back. 
Although it has 
great historical value, it has little 
magical power. Some PCs might 
be tempted to give it up. Those 
Anuireans w r ho keep it are one 
step closer to the Iron Throne, and in cor 
respondingly greater danger. Those Khi- 
nasi who keep it have a powerful bargain 
ing chip to extract favors from any 
Anuirean regent, or an incredibly lavish 
gift to bestow upon an ally. 

If the DM wants to remove the sword 
from the game, the Monkey King demands 
it as the price of his service and advice in 
his role as the court astrologer (the "two 
bloody stars"), Only the gods know where 
he might take it and in whose hands it 
might land. 


the spells of 
the chimoeron 


eyes, crystal balls, or any other form of visual 
magic, scrying, or divination-for the pur 
poses of magic and sight, it does not exist. 

The material component is 
a black opal worth at least 

1,000 gp.

spells of reason 

Avani's priesthood developed several 
spells that were favored by priests of the 
order-when the order died, the knowl 
edge was lost.

Sphere: Guardian 

Range: Touch 

Components: V, S. M 

Duration: Permanent until discharged

to the priesthood of Avani. It can be cast 
only by a high priest of 15th level or above, 
and it requires a minimum of 500 gp of 
gold and 2.000 gp of powdered diamond. 

It inflicts ld4 points of damage per 
level of the caster and releases a beam of 
light 10' in diameter centered on the 
glyph itself, creating an effect similar to a 
sunray spell for 1 round. Those harmed by 
sunlight suffer the usual penalties; others

undead cannot enter the warded area (the 
strength of the protection is equal to a 
protection from evil spell). Creatures from 
the Lower and Upper Planes are also pre 
vented from entering an area protected by 
a grave warding.

Exiled from the Beastlands for his constant 
chaotic trickery, the Monkey King goes by many 
names-Hanuman. Bacchus, Agent of the Celes 
tial Bureacracv-but he prefers to be called "Mon 
key King," 

In human form, the Monkey King is a master of 
disguise and merriment, often dressed in the bright 
mottled colors of a clown or jester In animal form, he 
often wears jewelry or a crown. In either form, he car 
ries a long staff (see the Scepm of the Monkey King 

Combat: He attacks without weapons in a wob 
bling, completely unpredictable manner Thb form 
of combat allows him to strike twice each round for 
ld6 points of damage per attack, and he can 
attempt to Pick Pockets on a successful strike. In 
trees or when otherwise hanging above the ground, 
the Monkey King can use his remarkably long and 
flexible prehensile Lad to attempt to Pick Pockets or 
to trip an opponent, 

Taunting: If the Monkey King is allowed to hoot 
and jeer for 1 round, the taunting has the same 
effect as a taunt spell. During the taunting, the 
Monkey King throws scraps of food and offal and 
grimaces at the target. 

In human form, the Monkey King uses his staff 
sceptre, striking once per round for 2d6+4 points of 
damage. 

The Monkey King has a natural telepathy that is 
always active, malting him impossible to surprise or 
deceive. In mortal danger he is 90% likely to have a 
"bad feeling ' and 25% likely to know' exactly what 
will happen. 

He has the spell-like abilities anti-magic shell (3 
times per day), charm person on anyone affectionate 
to monkeys, plane shift, and fdeport. 

The Monkey King is immune to all charm-related 



spells, including spells that can compel action (for 
example, geos)* He can summon 2d5 monkeys three 
times per day with 100% chance of success." He has 
a superior sense of smell and remarkable simian 
speed and balance. 

The Monkey King can perform all thieving abili 
ties-including Read Languages and Read Magical 
Scrolls-at a 95% chance of success. He climbs 
walls at a 100% chance of success. 

Habitat/Ecology; The Monkey King tends to 
the affairs of monkeys throughout the planes and 
worlds. He protects tribes of monkeys threatened 
by humans. The Monkey King prefers warm 
weather, sweet fruit, and lazy days. However, 
whenever he finds a pleasing place he soons grows 
restless. In addition to food and shelter, he 
requires adventure, pranks, and trickery'. These 
have driven him to leave many safe havens for the 
wilds of the world. 

The Sceptre of the Monkey King; 

Though it takes many forms, the Monkey King is 
never without his sceptre, a magical rod Lhai allows 
him to pole vault over all obstacles and that lifts 
him up into the sky to ride the clouds;(ai,the air. . 
walk spell). The sceptre can become a wand, a staff 
a cane, a spear, a shovel, or ahv.other long. partially, 
wooden tool. If stolen (and only the most impudent 
would steal from the Monkey King), the Sceptre 
functions normally for the thief for one day (long 
enough for the Monkey King to track down ^he ? 
sceptre, as long as it has not left the plane wberfc it 
was stolen). Thereafter it ceases functioningurltil 
again touched bv the Monkey King,

The mahogany constrictor is a reptilian predator 
that depends on both stealth and venom to bring 
down its prey. But the mahogany constrictor is both 
poisonous and magical. Its scales are a rich reddish- 
brown T with a spiral pattern of black and white 
scales running down its back. 

Combat: A mahogany constrictor's crushing grip 
is unlike that of other serpents. Because of its great 
she, it can do more than kill by asphyxiation, it can 
literally crush bones and rupture organs. As a 
result, its constriction damage increases each round 
it holds a victim in its coils. The first round damage 
is ld4, but this increases by ld4 each round to 2d4 
in the second, 3d4 in the third. 

The constrictor can also bite with its enormous 
fangs. Its venom Is relatively dilute lor such a large 
animat but there is lots of it. The poison begins 
working in ld3 rounds and then inflicts (halfif a 
saving throw is successful), 

Habi tat/Eco logy: Mahogany constrictors live 
in deep jungles, coastal swamps of cypress, and 
along forested rive thanks-anywhere there is both 
water and shelter. They hunt both in the trees and 
on the ground, approaching prey very slowly. 
Fholmorien inhabit desolate marshes and forests 
from the seashores to the mountain, as well as liv 
ing in deep caves.

The sword 
of Roele 


by Wolfgang Baur 


O n the border between Anuire and the land of the Khinasi, the Three Brother 
Mages fight an ancient and immortal awnshegh, the Chimera. The game of 
cat and mouse has recently begun to draw regents from the entire region. 
Rumors say that the blade of the last Anuirean emperor, the Sword of Roele , has been 
tracked to the Chimera's domain, the Chimaeron. The fact that the Gorgon's armies 
are mustering in Kiergard seems to support the rumor. 


But choosing sides between the Chimera and the Three Brothers is no easy matter. If 
the Chimera drives the Brothers out, the trade routes through the Chimaeron may be 
sealed, leaving the seas free for the Khinasi to monopolize trade. If the Brothers drive 
the Chimera from the magical sources that give her strength, they may establish a 
beachhead for the Khinasi traders, who are slowly gobbling up the lands of Anuire just 
as their own lands were once annexed by the empire long ago. 

Who will you and your comrades ally yourselves with? Who is the true enemy? Can you 
recover the Sword of Roele before anyone else does, and lay claim to the Iron Throne?
