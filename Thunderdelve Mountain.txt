INTRODUCTION 



Thunderdelve Mountain is designed to be 
used with the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS(r) 
Basic & Expert Sets. It may be used as either 
a solo or group adventure, although it is pri 
marily designed for solo play. 

This adventure eonsists of numbered 
entries. At the end ofeaeh entry, your charac 
ter will be faced with choices as to his or her 
next action. Based on the danger of the situa 
tion and the clues you have received before 
hand, you must choose which action to take. 
Based on your choice of action, you will be 
directed to read a new entry that tells you the 
result of your choice. Thus, the story unfolds 
under your direction. By paying careful 
attention to clues and by using common 
sense, you should be able to make sound deci 
sions. 

The Character 

On the last page of this adventure, you will 
find pre-rolled player characters. Choose one 
you would like to play during this adventure. 
Copy the information about this character 
onto the Character Sheetprintedinside the cover. 

Mapping 

On the inside ot the cover you will find a 
map. Only the entrances to Thunderdelve 
are marked on it; the rest is blank. As you 
enter each room in Thunderdelve, draw it on 
your map. A picture of each room will 
accompany the entry describing that room. 
Be sure to map accurately; the success ofyour 
mission could depend on it. 

Also, be sure to write down the number of 
the entry describing the room. Write the 
number inside the picture of the room as you 
draw i t. By recording the number of the room 
on your map, you will easily be able to look 
up the entry again should you return to that 
room at a later time. Also, the number of 
entries you have recorded on your map will 
affect your score at the end of the game. 

Included on the cover is a small hand- 
drawn map. You are free to use this during 
your wanderings. The writing can be trans 
lated using the table of Runic Transcriptions. 

Event Record 

Inside the cover you will find the Event 
Record. Below it are listed the letters of the 
alphabet. Some of the entries you will read 
will instruct you to cross off one or more of 
these letters as the result of an action. Be sure 
to do this-later in a different entry you may 
be asked if a certain letter is crossed off. If it 
is, the course of play may be altered. 


Combat 

Combat is conducted the same as in the 
D&D Basic and Expert Sets. Also, to help 
simulate the presence of a Dungeon Master, 
add the following rules: 

1) Special Instructions: Most of the combat 
situations in this adventure have special 
instructions that give the combat more of the 
feel of a game run by a Dungeon Master. The 
instructions state a set condition and a corres 
ponding entry. Immediately upon fulfillment 
of that condition, the player should turn to 
the corresponding entry and follow any 
instructions found there. 


EXAMPLE: If your hit points fall below 6, 
go to 86. 

2) Retreating: Unless an entry specifically 
states otherwise, you may retreat out of com 
bat at any time. Each ofyour opponents will, 
however, be entitled to one free swing at your 
back while you retreat. Their attacks will be 
at + 4 to simulate your vulnerability during 
flight. If you survive, you are considered to 
have escaped and eluded your opponents. 
They will return to their room if you should 
decide to come back. 


2 


3) Damage to Enemies: Your enemies' hit 
points are given in the entry, along with other 
vital information such as Armor Class. 
Record in the margin the amount of damage 
done to an opponent. Then if you flee from a 
fight and then later return, you have that 
record. You may attack your opponents in 
any order you wish. It does not have to be in 
the order their hit points are listed. 

EXAMPLE: You attack two goblins. The 
entry lists their hit points as 5 and 2. It might 
be to your advantage to attack the weaker 
goblin first to defeat him quickly, and avoid 
being attacked twice each round. 

4) Initiative: Unless an entry indicates oth 
erwise, your opponents gain the initiative 
each round during combat. If, however, you 
wish to roll two dice for initiative before each 
round (the high roller gaining the initiative), 
you may do so. In no case, however, should 
you automatically assume you have the ini 
tiative each round. 

5) Opponent Defeated: When an opponent 
is defeated, cross off its hit points listed in the 
entry. If you later return to a room where you 
defeated some of your opponents, this will 
remind you which ones you have already 
defeated and do not need to fight again. If 
you later return to a room where you defeated 
all your opponents, it will be empty. Simply 
ignore any description pertaining to them. 

6) Scoring: Every time you defeat an oppo 
nent, cross off a box under Victory Record. 
This may be found inside the cover. This 
record effects your score at the end of the 
game. 

Victory 

Once the victory at the end of the adven 
ture is achieved, return to this section and 
determine your score.

Treasure Table 

In addition to treasures listed in the 
entries, you might be instructed to roll on the 
Treasure Table after combat. This table may 
be found inside the cover. It indicates your 
opponents' treasure. 

Some results on the table will direct you to 
look up a Treasure Entry. This list of special 
Treasure Entries may be found on the last 
page of the adventure. When you gain one of 
these special treasures, you should cross that 
Treasure Entry off the table. If you roll that 
number again later, ignore the result and roll 
again. 

Defeat 

If your character is defeated in combat, or 
if an entry tells you your character is captured 
or lost, you must immediately choose a new 
character. You can no longer use the old one. 
You must cross him or her off the list of pre 
rolled characters and erase the statistics from 
the character record sheet. Do not, however, 
erase the Event Record. Any treasure carried 
is lost and must also be erased-it cannot be 
recovered. You must now choose a new cha- 
acter from the surviving characters on the 
pre-rolled list and record the statistics on the 
Character Sheet. 

The legendary Hammer of Vitroin and 
any of the special items recorded on the Event 
Record are exceptions to the rule. Because of 
their magical natures, it is assumed that the 
new character 'finds' them immediately 
upon entering Thunderdelve. 

When using a new character, you may start 
at either entrance into Thunderdelve, or you 
may return immediately to the scene of the 
former character's defeat. 

Magic Items 

In any solo adventure, it is necessary to 
adapt the rules by which magic items oper 
ate. The following items are just some of the 
magic that can be found in Thunderdelve 
that require modification. 

Potion of Healing: This potion can be used 
at any time except during a battle. Once com 
bat begins, no potion can be used. 

All Other Potions: Other potions can only 
be used in combat situations. The effects of 
the potion last only until the current combat 
ends. As soon as the current battle is over, the 
potion wears off. 

Scroll of Protection vs. Undead: If, while 
reading an entry, you are attacked by 
undead, you may read this scroll before com 
bat begins. The undead immediately flee. 


You may proceed to the next entry as if you 
had defeated them in combat. Do not, how 
ever, count them on your Victory Record. 
They return to the room as soon as you leave 
and will be there if you return. Remember 
that this scroll can only be used once. 

Ring of Regeneration: Each time you read a 
new entry, one point of damage will be 
healed. Remember that this ring will never 
heal damage caused by fire. You must keep a 
separate record of such damage. Also, the 
ring cannot raise a character from the dead. 

All potions and scrolls must be used before 
combat begins if they are to affect the bat 
tle. They cannot be used in the middle of 
battle. A. potion of healing can, of course, 
be used after battle. 

Runic Writings 

During play, you may discover inscriptions 
or scrolls written in runes-the alphabet of 
the dwarves. It is not necessary that you 
decode and read these runes in order to play, 
but they will provide you with valuable clues 
that help you make wise decisions. A table of 
runes and their equivalents in English can be 
found inside the cover. 

All the inscriptions are located on page 39. 
Please refer to this page when so directed by 
(an entry.) 

An Important Point: 

Often when playing a solo 
adventure, it is tempting to 
ignore fights and bad dice 
rolls, to read ahead in the 
entries, and to ignore bad 
results. Resist these temp 
tations! This game has 
been crafted to approxi 
mate the feel of a game run 
by a Dungeon Master. 
Much of the suspense is 
lost unless dice are read 
accurately, fights are 
fought fairly, and entries 
are read in their proper 
order.

THE BEGINNING OF THE TALE 


SI. You settle your compact dwarf frame into 
a comfortable chair and kick your booted feet 
up on the table. Closing your weary eyes, you 
tip the chair back and let the warm smells of 
the inn drift over you. The last copper in your 
purse was just exchanged for a frugal meal, 
and you are wondering how to remedy your 
poverty, when you feel a tug at your boot 
strap. You slowly open one eye and glare at 
the young boy perched nervously at your 
side. 

"Excuse me, please," he whispers. 
"There's a dwarf gentleman in the back room 
who has asked to speak with you." 

"What about?" you ask suspiciously. 

"I don't know," the boy stammers, "but 
he told me if I didn't bring you he'd boil me 
for a pudding." 

"Any other message?" you ask, closing 
your eye. 

"He said it paid well." 

You sit up and take your feet off the table. 
You didn't know there were any more 
dwarves in this area. You heard that the last 
was driven out years ago from a nearby ruin 
called Rumble Bell. Their clan was supposed 
to be extinct. Never one to let ignorance 
stand in your way, you rise to your feet and 
follow the boy into a small room. The boy 
leaves quickly, closing the door. 

The room is lit only by the flames in the 
fireplace. A boiling pot of beef hangs over the 
fire, filling the room with its rich aroma. 
Some broth boils over and, with a hiss, 
steams on the logs. Seated at the table before 
you is an ancient dwarf. His shiny black eyes 
are locked on you as he clenches his hands, 
then releases them. He motions you to a chair 
with a nod of his head. He opens his mouth to 
speak, and you notice that several of his old 
teeth have been replaced with gold. 

"I've heard rumors," he says, "that you 
are a worthy fighter." You shrug your shoul 
ders. He chuckles. "Good, you're tight 
mouthed. My name is Nimron. I'm the 
Clanmaster of the dwarves in these parts." 

"I didn't think there were any," you state 
bluntly. 

"Oh, yes," he says, "though not as many 
as once. And the rest have been reduced to 
poverty. But once we were prosperous, and 
our goods were well-known throughout the- 
world." His voice falls to a whisper. "Fifty 
years ago I was master of the richest dwarves 
in the realm. Long did we and our ancestors 
prosper in our home of Thunderclelve. The 
upper mansions were beautiful indeed and 
were called, in our tongue, the Halls of Para 
dise." 


"Paradise," you sneer. "There's no such 
place. It's a legend taught me at my mother's 
beard." 

"Legend!" snaps Nimron. "Speak not to 
me of legends! No, my young ignorant, Para 
dise is real enough. Our mansions were 
famed for their beauty and industry, and still 
they lie at Thunderdelve beneath the moun 
tain outside this very town. There lie our 
mines and Forge. There rots our art and 
craft, all that is our love for home and stone. 
There indeed waits our paradise. Speak not 
to me of empty legends; I have walked within 
the reality." 

"If it's so real, then why is it spoken of only 
as a pixy tale for young dwarves?" 

Nimron's eyes flare up. then sink down to 
stare at the table before him. "My mines 
became the breeding ground for a hideous 
fyrsnaca. the giant flame serpents of the 
earth's heart. Whether it came by chance or 
was maliciously directed by an evil wizard 1 
justly cheated, I do not know. Surely, though, 
its cunning and fury were well-planned. In 
sudden onslaught, the fyrsnaca ate the bar 
racks, the Keeper's home, and much of my 
suite. It erupted from the mines, burying our 
forge, devouring the very stone of Thunder- 
delve, breathing fire, slaying my people, 
destroying Paradise." 

He sits silently for a moment, then looks 
back at you. "In our panic, no proper defense 
was made. Nor was it possible! The fyrsnaca 
attacked, then burrowed back into the rock, 
then rose and attacked again! I barely 
escaped by secret stairs, the Keeper's babe in 
my arms, the fyrsnaca's fiery breath at our 
back. My own wife and children were lost." 

"What became of them and the Keeper, I 
do not know. Every rescue party I sent failed 
to return. At last I could spare no more ofour 
pitiful remnant. I raised the Keeper's babe as 
my own, training her for the day when 
revenge would ripen into action. She is 
Grona Marblefist, the Champion, hereditary 
Keeper of the Forge of Thunderdelve. Now 
she has ventured into the halls of Thunder 
delve, and she too has failed. She is a captive. 
I ask you to bring her back." 

He closes his eyes, bringing his hands up to 
his face and pressing his head against them. It 
seems at first that he is in danger of being 
overcome by grief, but you quickly notice 
that grief is not the emotion he is struggling 
against. He is doing his best to contain an 
anger that has been festering inside him for 
fifty years. Slowly, he lowers his hands and 
turns to stare into the fire. In a low voice, he 
resumes speaking. 


"Several years back, the bandit, Redface, 
and his men took up residence in our outer 
halls. Somehow they have avoided the 
fyrsnaca's wrath. I ask you to rescue Grona 
from them. I do not ask you to drive the ban 
dits out, just return Grona. All I require is 
Grona! You may keep any treasure that you 
find." 

Nimron pulls a valuable ring from his fin 
ger and hands it to you without looking. 
"This ring I give you," he says. "It will out 
line all the secret ways of Paradise with a wit- 
chfire, allowing you freer passage." He pulls 
a small piece of leather from his pocket. 
"Here, too, is a rough map of Paradise. It 
will give you a general idea of your location. I 
believe that Grona is held in the servants' 
quarter." 

Nimron turns back to you and smiles. 
"Surely this is a simple matter for one such as 
yourself?" You smile and nod. Nimron sighs. 
"I am glad you consent. It is unwise to ven 
ture beyond the bandits' confines. I am cer 
tain the rest of Thunderdelve is filled with 
evil beyond your ken. It is most important 
that you bring Grona back safely. Do not 
attempt more." 

He gives you a bag of 100 gp and tells you 
of a secret door that will take you into the 
back halls of Paradise if the front gate is 
impassable. A strange gleam comes into his 
eye as he leans toward you. "If you fail to 
return with Grona," he whispers, "more than 
your own life is forfeit." 

"I'll get her." you mutter as you grab the 
gold and ragged map from the table. You 
leave Nimron's dusky room and go to the sta 
ble where you have been making your bed. 
You pick up your few belongings, don your 
harness, and head off toward the mountain 
outside of town. A short march brings you to 
the main gates ofThunderdelve, the entrance 
to the Halls of Paradise. 

Go to Entry 1.

1 

You follow the now broken track that leads 
away from the main road, toward the moun 
tain. It is untended and covered with debris 
and growth. Around you are the sounds of 
the forest animals, but little else. As you near 
the mountain, you leave the track and press 
on through the undergrowth, always being 
sure to keep the track within sight. At last you 
find yourself in a small valley nestled between 
two of the mountain's spurs. The air around 
you vibrates with deep echoes of some sound 
less vibration within the rocks at your feet. 
The sound is not like that of thunder, but 
there is still an aptness to the name Thunder- 
delve, for the atmosphere is filled with the 
tension one feels after the lightning strikes 
and before the thunder voices itself. 



Set back into a cliffside, under an over 
hanging ledge, is a large set of thick doors- 
the front gates of Thunderdelve. Behind 


them lie the upper halls of Paradise. They are 
indeed substantial, made of ironwood and 
bound with rusting iron. Intricate grooves 
running across the doors mark where they 
were at one time filigreed with silver or gold, 
but vandals have dug out the precious metals 
long ago. A rusting portcullis hangs partway 
in front of the doors. A tangled web of vegeta 
tion and rotting debris blocks most of the 
gateway, but a path has been cleared to the 
left-hand door. It stands ajar. You can creep 
closer (2) or look for the secret entrance old 
Nimron told you about (158). 

2. You push your way slowly through the 
underbrush and work your way toward the 
gates. If A is crossed off your Event Record, 
go to 8. Otherwise, go to 9. 

3. You move toward the guard with speed and 
stealth. Roll ld20. If the roll is less than or 
equal to your Dexterity, go to 4. Otherwise, 
go to 5. 

4. You surprise the guard and club him neatly 
on the back of the neck. He collapses. After 
gagging him and tying him with his own belt, 
you hide the unconscious form in the bushes. 
Roll once for treasure, cross A off your Event 
Record, and go to 14. 


5. As you move toward the gate, you step on 
a dead branch. It cracks with a sound like 
lightning. The guard whirls to face you, his 
spear poised. He laughs through his bad teeth 
and calls over his shoulder. "Fatty! Davie! 
Them little dwarves keep a-coming!" You 
can take the initiative and charge (6), or wait 
to see who responds to Toothy's call (7). 

6. With a wild cry from your throat, you rush 
the guard. He looks blankly back into Thun 
derdelve wondering where his reinforce 
ments are. You automatically gain the 
initiative for the first round of combat. If you 
win, go to 10. If you hit Toothy before he hits 
you, go to 11 . 

Toothy (1st level thief): AC 6; hp 4; MV 
90'(30');D 1-6; ML 8; ALC 

7. No one comes. You see the cockiness in 
Toothy's eyes fade to dull resignation as he 
poises his spear and throws it at you. Roll to 
see if the spear hits. If it does, roll for 1-6 
points of damage. If you survive, go to 12. 

Toothy (1st level thief): AC 6; hp 4; MV 
90'(30');D 1-6; ML 8; ALC 


5 








8. You move cautiously to the gate, but see no 
one. You creep closer and peer under the 
bush where you hid Toothy. He is still there. 
It appears no one has realized the gate guard 
is missing. It must be safe to go inside. Go to 

14. 

9. Thirty feet from the doors, you stop. Just 
inside the open gate stands a foolish guard 
leaning on a spear, his back toward you. His 
hand is cupped to his ear as if he were strain 
ing to listen to something further inside 
Thundedelve. You can try subduing him (3) 
or turn back and look for the secret entrance 
Nimron told you about (158). 

10. Toothy falls to the ground. You hide him 
quickly under a nearby bush. Roll once for 
treasure, cross A off your Event Record, and 
go to 14. 

11. "Ow!" cries Toothy, throwing down his 
sword. He takes off his belt and hands it to 
you. "I don't care if you go in or not. Tie me 
up. Please!" You oblige him, hiding him 
behind a nearby bush. Cross A off your Event 
Record. If you want to step inside, go to 14. 
If this looks too guarded, you may attempt 
instead to go to the secret entrance Nimron 
told you about by going to 158. 

12. You charge him as he draws a short sword 
and prepares for your attack. If you win, go 
to 10. If you hit Toothy before he hits you, go 

to 11. 

Toothy (1st level thief): AC 6; hp 4; MV 
90'(30'); D 1-6; ML 8; AL C 


13. You find yourself once again outside the 
gates of Thunderdelve. You can creep closer 
(2) or look for the secret entrance old Nimron 
told you about (158).

You are standing in a large, drafty hall. It is 
filled with a dull, rumbling sound. A sliver of 
bright light from outside pours in through the 
open gate on the west. A campfire burns 
dimly in front of you, casting light across the 
floor. The hall has been ravaged by man, 
weather, and time. Remnants of a once-fine 
mosaic floor can be seen among the leaves, 
refuse, and mud brought in by the winds and 


rains. A scratchy voice rings out, "Shut up, 
out there! I'm trying to sleep!" You have dif 
ficulty placing its source. You see no sign of a 
guard. 

Murder holes lace the ceiling, but thick 
cobwebs hang through them. You notice a 
partially open door on the north wall. 
Through it shines a dim light. You also notice 
that much of the mud on the floor leads to a 
door on the south wall. Another door, in the 
southern alcove, is boarded shut with a few 
planks. A death's head has been crudely 
scrawled on it in charcoal. You can investi 
gate the northern door (28), open the door in 
the northern alcove (80), walk on to the east 
ern end of the hall (24), unbar the door in the 
southern alcove (15), or open the muddy 
southern door closest to the gate (53). 

15. If B or AA is crossed off your Event 
Record, then go to 23. Setting your weapon 
aside and planting your feet firmly against 
the doorjamb, you pull on one of the planks. 
Slowly it works itself free in your hands. You 
set it carefully aside and take hold of the 
remaining plank. Bracing, you pull. This 
plank is more stubborn. You pull again. It 
snaps in your hands, echoing through the 
hall. If B is crossed off your Event Record, go 
to 16. Otherwise, go to 17. 

16. You pull the remains of the plank aside 
and shove open the door. You listen, but hear 
nothing. Go to 190. 

17. The scratchy voice from the north yells: 
"I told you to shut up and by Zemos, I meant 
it!" A fat. groggy bandit with a drawn sword 
appears in the door on the north wall. His 
eyes open wide in surprise when he spots you 
trying to hide in the alcove. "Well, well," he 
mutters and advances toward you. You can 
stay and fight (18) or run through the skull- 
embossed door you just unbarred (19). 

18. You find yourself face to face with the fat 
bandit. "Thought you'd evade me, did 
you?" he sneers. "Thought I'd forget. But 
I'm sharp. Sharper than most. And me blade 
is sharpest of all," he laughs and lunges at 
you. If you hit him but don't kill him, go 
immediately to 20. If you take 9 points of 
damage from him, go to 21. If you win, go to 
22 . 

Fatty (2nd level thief): AC 6; hp 7; MV 
90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 8; AL C 


19. You run through the skull-marked door. 
Fatty curses after you: "You're doomed, you 
runt! Ifyou return, I'll be waiting! And I can 
waits longer than most." Go to 190. 


20. Fatty throws up an arm to protect himself 
and, instead, becomes entangled in his own 
cape. With a moan, he falls to the ground. 
You aren't sure if he is asleep again or 
wounded. You must leave this open hallway 
quickly, before the sound of your fighting 
draws anyone else. Cross off AA on your 
Event Record. You can exit through the open 
skull-marked door on the south (190), or 
return to 14 and make another choice. 

21. You reel from the blow. Fatty's sword 
hangs in his hand, and he is panting. "Well," 
he gasps, "have you had enough? You can see 
I'm the better fighter. Why don't you give 
up, and we can both get some rest?" You can 
surrender (434) or return to 18 and fight on. 

22. With a moan, he falls to the ground. You 
aren't sure if he is asleep again or wounded. 
You must leave this open hall before the 
sound of your fighting draws anyone else. 
Cross off B on your Event Record. You can 
exit through the open skull-marked door on 
the south (190), or return to 14 and make 
another choice. 

23. The door lies in splinters around its frame 
but is at least now passable. You may pass 
through it to 190 or go back to 14 and make 
another choice.

You are in the eastern end of a great hall. 
You hear a low grumbling. A large, semi 
circular stone table fills the center of the hall. 
Bold runes are carved on its front. To read 
them, see Inscription 1. The center of the 
table is open, with room for a dwarf to sit 
comfortably. The table is ornately carved, as 
is the ceiling above you. Over the years, this 
table has been filled with trash. Another set of 
doors identical to the ones at the front gate, 
stands at the eastern end of the hall. If D is 
crossed off your Event Record, go to 26. Oth 
erwise. go to 27. 

25. You poke through the debris. Clouds of 
dust billow up, filling your nostrils. You 
sneeze violently. Burying your head in your 
arms and hoping no one hears, you duck 
behind the table and wait. No one conies. 
You have found nothing of interest in the 
trash pile and may continue on to the western 
end of the hall (14), open the northern door 
(60), the southern door (71), or the eastern 
doors (74). 


6 




26. You peer in the northern door which is 
ajar and see that the havoc in the bandit's 
throne room remains unchanged. You may 
enter the room (70), investigate the trash in 
the table (25). open the southern door (71), 
open the eastern doors (74), or continue to 
the western end of the hall (14). 

27. You hear several loud voices behind the 
door to the north. You may listen further to 
the voices behind the northern door (60), 
open the southern door (71). open the eastern 
doors (74), investigate the trash in the table 
(25), or walk into the western end of the hall 
(14). 



Cautiously you peer into this lighted room. 
There are cots, a table, chairs, and a few 
spears. There is also cheese with a dagger 
sticking in it on the table. IfB is crossed off 
your Event Record, go to 31. If AA is crossed 
off. go to 30. Otherwise, go to 33. 

29. Closing both doors, you lean back for a 
quick rest. Your eyes scan the room, but you 
see nothing of interest. You may eat some of 
the cheese if you wish and pocket the dagger if 
you like. The spears are too long to use well in 
these halls. You can take the set of dice or the 
large bell you find lying on the table. If you 
take the dice, cross BB off your Event 
Record. If you take the bell, cross CC off 
your Event Record. You go to both doors and 
listen, but hear nothing that indicates you 
have been heard. You may exit by the western 
door (46) or by the southern door (14). 

30. Lying on one of the cots is the fat bandit. 
He mutters, "Just let that bearded half-runt 
shows himself again. I ain't afraid of him nor 
no ghosts neither. Just dare him to try any 
thing with me again." Go to 33. 

31. A slim, young pageboy is sitting at the 
table fiddling with some dice. His blue eyes 
lock into yours. You sense fear. If I is crossed 
off your Event Record, go to 44. Otherwise, 
go to 37. 

32. IfDD is marked off your Event Record, 
then go to 45. "Wait!" Davie shouts, looking 
down at the defeated Fatty. "You know I 
don't want to fight you. I was only fighting 
'cause if I didn't. Fatty would have taken my 
head off first. Cross B off your Event Record 
and go to 37. 


33. A slim, young pageboy is sitting at the 
table fiddling with some dice. You move 
slightly and the door creaks. The boy's blue 
eyes lock into yours. The fat bandit lying on 
one of the cots has his back toward you. He 
pulls the blanket tighter under his chin and 
snarls, "If you're going to come in, Davie, 
hurry up and shut the blasted door. There's a 
draft." Davie stands up nervously and says: 
"I am in, Fatty. But you have a visitor." Fatty 
rolls over to stare at you in surprise. Davie, 
the pageboy, does not fight well. He only 
occasionally aims a weak blow directly at 
your shield. Do not roll any hits for him-he 
automatically misses. If you kill Fatty, go to 
32. If you kill Davie, go to 38. 

Fatty and Davie (2nd and 1st level thieves): 

AC 6; hp 7,3; MV 90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 

8; ALC 


34. Davie picks up the dice and throws an 11. 
You throw a 3. This performance repeats 
until Davie wins. He smiles and says: "I 
think I won. You're to surrender." You know 
you have been cheated. If you want to simply 
surrender, go to 434. If you want to fight, go 
to 42. 

35. You nod your head and throw your weap 
ons on the cot. "These are the rules," he says. 
"The first to roll three out of five wins. You go 
first." Roll 2d6 for you, then roll 2d6 for 
Davie. The high roller wins. The first of you 
to win three rolls wins the dice game. IfDavie 
wins, go to 39. If you win the first two rolls, 
go to 34. 

36. Davie cowers in the corner. You can 
either strike him where he squats or tie him 
up. If you strike him, cross off DD on your 
Event Record. If you tie him up, cross off 
HH on your Event Record. Roll once for 
treasure and go to 29. 

37. "Do you like dice?" he asks. "I'm 
Davie," he says. "I guess you're here about 
the other dwarf. You know I don't care noth 
ing at all about her, so there's no point in us 
fighting. Let's both throw our weapons on 
the cot and throw dice. If you win. I'll tell you 
where she is. If I win, you surrender to me 
peaceful like. Is that fair with you?" You 
notice a large bell lying on the table beside 
him. If you flee, he will ring the bell and raise 
the alarm. You can either accept his invita 
tion to play (35) or attack him (36). 

38. Davie crumbles to the floor. Cross DD off 
your Event Record. "You sadistic tripe!" 
screams Fatty. In a burst of berserk rage, he 
flings his sword at you. As you duck aside, he 


throws himself at you. A chair behind you is 
smashed into kindling, and you are pinned 
instantly to the floor. Fatty's huge arms 
tighten around you, pressing your face into 
his belly. You cannot breathe and your ribs 
are being crushed. Roll Id20. If the number 
is greater than your Strength, go to 40. Oth 
erwise, go to 41. 

39. With the last throw of the dice, your heart 
sinks. Davie has won. You look longingly at 
your weapon on the cot. If you are Lawful, 
you must keep your bargain. Cross HH off 
your Event Record and go to entry 434. If 
you are Neutral, you may either surrender 
(434) or cheat and attack Davie (36). 

40. You feel the great strain this man is exert 
ing on your small frame. The pressure is 
unbearable. You must escape or die. You 
writhe violently but cannot loosen his hold. 
Take 1-8 points of damage. Ifyou survive, go 
to 43. 

41. You strain and slowly work both arms 
free of Fatty's enormous body. You feel about 
blindly, and your hand finds a leg from the 
broken chair. With all your might you hit 
Fatty on the head with it. He goes limp. You 
are trapped under him and must struggle to 
throw off his enormous weight before you suf 
focate. Exhausted, you tie him up. Roll twice 
for treasure, then go to 29. 

42. You throw the table aside and leap for 
Davie's throat. As the table goes over, Davie 
grabs the dagger stuck in the cheese. Unfor 
tunately, the cheese comes with it. Davie tries 
to club you with the cheese, but you knock it 
quickly to your left. A quick swing with your 
right fist knocks Davie to the floor. He is 
unconscious. You have won the fight, but will 
get no information from him. You tie him up. 
Roll once for treasure. Cross HH off your 
Event Record, and go to 29. 

43. You feel yourself blacking out. You are 
trapped under a mountain of flesh, doomed. 
You open your mouth to scream. Then in a 
flash ofinspiration you bite down as hard as you 
can. Your teeth sink into Fatty's belly. He 
screams and lets you go. You both struggle to 
your feet, reclaim your weapons, and continue 
the fight. Return to 33 to finish the battle. 

44. "You remember me," shouts the boy. "I 
never meant you any harm. 1 got you out of 
the pit." Go to 37. 

45. You defeated all who oppose you. There 
is nothing left but to move on. You may go 
south through the door to 14 or west through 
the door to 46.

You step back and kick the door open with 
your iron-shod boot. Beyond is a dark, dusty 
room strewn with broken spear hafts, two- 
legged chairs, and other rummage. The 
mechanism operating the portcullis is housed 
here, but it is locked in place by rust. Dust lies 
thick on the spiral stairs leading from the 
main room to a narrow door on the south. 
You may exit through this southern door atop 
the stairs (47) or through the eastern door 
(28). 



You open the small door, brushing the 
heavy cobwebs aside. Dim light filters in 
through the archer slits in the western wall. 
Murder holes lace the floor. Another narrow 
door is across the room from you. Before it 
sits a giant black widow spider. It moves, and 
you smell its stench. You may confront the 
spider (48) or return the way you came (to 46 
or 207). 

48. As you move forward, the bloated spider 
rushes to meet you, swaying on its spindly 
legs. To your relief, you realize it is a young 
spider. If the spider bites you, go to 50. If you 
win, go to 49.

49. Panting, you kick aside the spider's body 
and lean into an archer's slit, gasping for 
clean air. After you recover, you tear aside 
webs and notice many animal skeletons and 
one human skeleton. Scattered among the 
debris are 68 sp. You may exit through the 
southern door (207) or the northern door 
(46). 

50. You lash out at the ugly creature but miss. 
Its fangs sink deep into your forearm. As it 
hangs there, you bash it against the wall until 
it falls to the floor. You must make a Saving 
Throw vs. Poison. If you fail, go to 51. If you 
Save, return to 48 and finish the fight. 


51. You fall to the wall. Take 2-8 points of 
damage. If you survive, go to 52. 

52. After a moment, the room stands still. 
You pull yourself to your feet. It is fortunate 
that this black widow was a young member of 
its species. A fully grown one would have 
killed you with one bite. Return to 48 and 
finish the fight. 


IfNN is crossed off your Event Record, go 
to 59. As you open the door, you hear the 
snort and stamping of a heavy animal. The 
room holds three horses. One is a beautiful 
animal wearing a blanket of scarlet trimmed 
in gold thread. The other animals are mangy. 
One wears a bearclaw necklace around its 
neck. The horses grow skittish at your 
appearance. You may search the room (54), 
try to take the bearclaw necklace (57). or 
leave (14). 

54. You find nothing but hay and tack. The 
horse in the scarlet blanket begins to paw the 
stone, its ears laid back. You see a dark bun 
dle tied against the wall in the back corner. 
You can risk retrieving it (55) or leave (14). 

55. As you move slowly toward the bundle, 
the angry horse lashes out at you with both its 
hooves. You must roll two attacks against 
yourself. You need not attack in return. Ifyou 
survive these two attacks, go to 56.

56. You roll aside and rise to your feet, grab 
bing the bag. As the beast rears again, you 
dodge under its belly and escape back into the 
front hall. You slam the door behind you and 
open the bag. It is full of oats. Go to 14. 

57. You approach the horse slowly and speak 
quietly to the animal. As you do so, you reach 
up slowly and take hold of the necklace. The 
bearclaws are old and have not been properly 
preserved. You try to take the necklace but 
you are too short to reach the top of the 
horse's neck, where the necklace is tied. You 
can leave (14), search the room (54), or try to 
work the necklace off the horse (58). 

58. Speaking to the horse quietly, you work 
slowly, and rotate the necklace around the 
horse's neck until the knot is in your grasp. 


You carefully untie it. Ifyou wish to wear the 
filthy bearclaw necklace, cross NN off your 
Event Record. You may now leave this room 
(14) or investigate it further (54). 

59. You hear the stamping of animals in the 
room. These horses belong to the thieves you 
encountered earlier. You may search the 
room (54) or leave (14). 

60. You listen at the door but cannot hear the 
occupants' speech. You can tell th'ey are men, 
and you distinctly hear the name 'Grona 
Marblefist,' followed by sounds of coarse laugh 
ter. You may slam the door open, ready to 
attack (61) or explore the rest of this hall (24).

You throw your full weight against the 
door, smashing it open and surprising the 
men inside. This room, lit by several oil 
lamps, was once elegant and is still full of 
seats, cushions, and tapestries. The walls are 
carved, and dotted with mosaic pictures. 
Thick rugs cover the floor. You squint into the 
bright light and make out a large bandit sit 
ting on a throne, a sword across his lap. His 
face is bearded on the left side only; the right 
side is a red scar. Next to him stands a dandy 
smelling a silken handkerchief. 

A dwarf woman, probably Grona, is 
bound and kneeling before the throne, a 
chain around her neck. She looks at you 
proudly, pain and hope shining in her eyes. 
You yell "Maklin's Hammer!" and charge. 
Three guards intercept you. The redfaced 
bandit jumps off the throne, grabs Grona, 
and (followed by the dandy) flees through a 
door on the opposite side of the room. He 
curses his men's incompetence. Three of 
those bandits move in to attack. If your hit 
points fall below 6, go to 65. When you defeat 
one bandit, go to 63. When you defeat two 
bandits, go to 64. When you defeat all the 
bandits, go to 62. 

Bandit guards (2nd level thieves): AC 6; hp 
6,7,5; MV 90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 8: AL C 


62. You fall back into the throne, gasping for 
air. You dully realize that the scarred bandit 
must have been Redface himself and that the 
dandy must have been his nefarious captain, 
Zemon Trist. With a curse, you rise. Even 


8 




now the bandits are strengthening their 
defenses and leading Grona farther away. 
The room is filling rapidly with smoke. Roll 
three times for treasure and cross off D on 
your Event Record. The ring Nimron gave 
you is outlining a secret door on the north. 
You may leave through it (67) or through the 
southern door (24). 

63. The three guards move to surround you. 
You swing your shield at the one behind you. It 
catches him in the chest, throwing him back 
into one of the oil lamps, knocking it down. He 
falls to the ground senseless. The oil splashes 
onto one of the old tapestries and it begins to 
smolder. Return to 61 and resume the battle. 

64. The two bandits have maneuvered you so 
your back is against the throne, restricting your 
actions. Your size, however, is in your favor- 
the air that these taller men breathe is filling 
with smoke from the burning tapestry. Their 
eyes water and they begin to cough. Suddenly, 
one of the bandits overreaches in his swing. You 
duck easily under the blade. It slices into the 
wood of the throne and sticks. Before he can 
recover, you kick his belly. He falls. Roll 2d6. If 
the result is greater than 8, go to 66. Otherwise, 
return to 61 and finish the fight. 

65. You feel weak and weary. You stagger and 
trip over a thick rug and fall. You look up and 
see one of the bandits, sword poised above 
you. You black out. 

Sometime later, you revive in a dark and 
cold room. It takes you a moment to realize 
that you are still in the throne room, but the 
oil fires have burned out. Lying next to you is 
the cold body of the bandit. In his back is an 
arrow. It looks like a goblin arrow. It would 
appear that someone was more interested in a 
personal vendetta against the bandit than in 
capturing you. Go to 62. 

66. The bandit suddenly yanks on a tapestry. 
Before you can react, it falls over your head. 
You struggle to free yourself. But when you 
break free of the fabric's heavy hold, the 
room is empty. Go to 62. 



U L 


You find yourself in a narrow corridor of 
rough stone, dimly lit from numerous holes 
in the walls. The floor is thick with dust. A 
few footprints show where someone has 
passed before you. Some lead through 


another secret door your ring outlines. Oth 
ers lead to small holes carved into the walls. 
You peek through one of the holes. If D is 
crossed off on your Event Record, go to 69. 
Otherwise, go to 68. 

68. You peer into a large room. You cannot see 
much of it. You see the back of a large man 
seated on a throne. He has his sword out and 
taps it on his palm. An evil voice says: "Let me 
kill her now. Master. She will never talk. Let me 
return her tongue to her people." You are 
shocked to realize that it is the sword itself which 
has spoken! The large man caresses its hilt and 
says, "No, dear Render, there are ways to make 
proud, young dwarves talk." 

You move to another hole and peer 
through. There is Grona, chained in the cen 
ter of the room, several guards standing 
around her. You hear another voice speak. 
You shift your position and see a dandy. He 
chuckles, "Leave her to me. General. I can 
make her talk." "I dare say you could," says 
the large man, "but we could just as well 
leave her with Trudy for an hour!" Everyone, 
including the sword, laughs wickedly. You are 
greatly outnumbered, but your anger is 
mounting. You notice that your ring outlines 
another secret door leading into this center 
room. You can slam it open, ready for a fight 
(61) or leave in hopes of rescuing Grona 
when the odds are more even (81). 

69. You see the throne room where you fought 
the bandits and lost Grona. It is still in sham 
bles. Your ring outlines two secret doors. \bu 
may exit by the southern one, into the throne 
room (70), or by the northern one (81). 

70. You walk through the debris you have 
created and look for any signs of change since 
you last were here. You see none. You can 
leave by the secret door on the north (67) or 
through the southern door (24). 



Stale air swirls out. You force yourself 
across the threshold, looking for signs of dan 
ger. But you find none. This large room is 
inlaid with marble and granite. Numerous 
holes in the design show where gems or pre 
cious metals once were. It is cold, and you 
have the uncomfortable feeling that you are 
being watched. You look about, but see noth 
ing more than tables skewed about, the 
decayed contents of their drawers long ago 
spilled onto the floor. This must have been 


Nimron's main office. You wonder why the 
bandits never use this place. You notice a tap 
estry hanging on the southern wall. You may 
investigate it (72) or leave (24). 

72. You shove the rotting tapestry aside. 
Moldering fragments of cloth stick to your 
hands. You find a chest, but it is locked. You 
can try breaking the rusty lock (73) or leave 
this sad place (24). 

73. The lock snaps easily. Slowly you raise 
the lid, averting your face. Inside, resting on 
a bed of velvet, is an iron egg. It looks very 
strange in this elegant container. The egg is 
seamless. You shake it but hear nothing. If 
you wish to take it, cross E off your Event 
Record. Otherwise, leave it here. Your ring 
outlines a secret door that was hidden behind 
the tapestry on the western half of the south 
wall. You may open it (223) or leave (24). 



The roaring sound is quite loud here and is 
caused by twin waterfalls cascading down the 
eastern wall, falling into a clear pool that runs 
the length of the room. Spanning the center 
of the pool and leading to a set of great doors 
standing between the two falls, is a bridge of 
crystal. The bridge hums as it vibrates from 
the pounding of the two falls. Even the floor, 
made of red quartz, vibrates with a low rum 
bling sound. This great hall looks as though 
at one time it might have been quite festive. 

The water in the pools looks wholesome 
and, judging from the scattered buckets, 
must serve as the bandits' principal water 
source. The doors to the north, south, and 
west can be barred shut, so this hall can serve 
as an interior line of defense in case of attack. 
The southern door is barred shut and. has 
remained so for some time. You may pass 
through the northern door (105) or the west 
ern doors (24). You can also try to open the 
closed eastern doors (75), unbar the southern 
door (255), or drink from the pool (76). 

75. You cross the crystal bridge, the water 
thundering loudly beneath your feet, the 
bridge's vibrations rising through your boots, 
and you grasp the door's great handles. You 
push, but nothing happens. The doors are 
firmly locked, or barred from the other side.

You could never break through so much iron- 
wood, and besides, only Barin knows what 
wicked thing the noise might arouse. If Z is 
crossed offyour Event Record, go to 77. Oth 
erwise, return to 74 and make another 
choice. 

76. You kneel and drink cautiously front the 
noisy waters, then more deeply, for the water 
is cool and refreshing, full of tasty minerals. 
As you begin to rise, you note a twinkle of 
gold under the bridge in a spot only a dwarv- 
ish eye could see. If F is crossed off on your 
Event Record, go to 74 and make a new 
choice. Otherwise, you may reach under the 
bridge (78) or stand up and reexamine the 
hall (74). 

77. "Barin's Forge!" You shout, proclaiming 
the words old Nimron taught you. Nothing 
happens. But then, growing front a single 
bright point, witchfire burns through the 
ironwood, running like water through chan 
nels that once held golden filigree. Silently, 
the magic light dies away, and the doors 
swing open. Go to 265. 

78. Your hand feels about and closes on cold 
metal. You draw up a golden dipper attached 
to the bridge by a mithril chain. Engraved in 
the bottom of the water-filled dipper are some 
runes. To read them, see Inscription 2. You 
may drink from the dipper (79) or, letting it 
fall back into the pool, examine the rest of the 
hall (74). 

79. You compulsively drain it in one swallow. 
Your veins catch fire, and a burning vigor 
spreads through your body, healing your 
wounds. Regain 2-7 hit points. You stand 
refreshed, ready to examine the rest of the 
hall. Cross off F on your Event Record and 
go to 74.

The stone in this rough corridor is dirty 
with mud. You move ahead silently. You 
sense a warmness to the north. The oppres 
sive silence is broken by a short, goblin-like, 
harsh laugh followed by a cry. The door on 
the east is painted in faded runes. If you wish 
to read them, see Inscription 3. You may 
explore the slightly dustier passage to the east 
(81), open the painted door (82), investigate 


the warmth to the north (113), or open the 
battered door on the south (14).

This hallway is dusty. You move ahead 
freely. Halfway along, your ring outlines a 
secret door on the southern wall. As you 
pause, you hear the distinct sound of thunder 
in the background. You may investigate the 
secret door (67), the northern door (148), the 
southern bend in the passage (105), or the 
western end of the passage (80). 

82 



This dingy little room holds a table and 
cot. The table is piled high with dirty dishes, 
half-eaten pork ribs, and empty bottles. 
Through the open door on the east comes a 
light and a drunken voice: "Come here, 
Trudy. Come on, me girl. There's nothing to 
be afraid of. Old Maudin won't hurt you." 
You can look through the eastern door (91), 
search this room (83), or leave (80). 

83. You search a few drawers in the table. There 
doesn't seem to be much of use-old socks, a tin 
cup, a broken dagger, ancient invoices front 
Nimron's time. If G is crossed off you Event 
Record, go to 85. Otherwise, go to 86. 

84. You lean back against the table, breath 
ing heavily, looking over at Maudin's still 
form. Roll once for treasure. You take the 
jailor's keys. Cross G offyour Event Record. 
You may exit through the western door (80) 
or go through the eastern door (99). 

85. It quickly becomes obvious that there is 
nothing of value. You may exit through the 
western door (80) or go through the eastern 
door (99). 

86. Suddenly, the room grows brighter and 
you look up to see a fat jailor standing in the 
eastern door, a torch in his hand. With a 
curse, he leaps at you, swinging the torch at 
your eyes. Since you have been using your 
infravision, you are confused by the sudden 
influx of light as the torch swings at your 
eyes. For the first two rounds, Maudin auto 
matically gains the initiative and has all his 
hit rolls at + 2. Your hit rolls are at -2. If you 
win, go to 84. If you roll a 20, go to 87. If he 
inflicts 10 points of damage on you. go to 88. 

Maudin (2nd level thief): AC 7; hp 10; 
MV 90'(30'); D 1-4; ML 10; AL C 


87. By the languid way Maudin is fighting, 
you can tell he is drunk. With sudden inspira 
tion, you roll at his knees. He is taken by sur 
prise and falls head-first into the wall, 
collapsing over his desk in a drunken stupor. 
Go to 84. 

88. Maudin stabs the torch straight into your 
face. You cry out and throw your hands up. 
dropping your weapon in the process. 
Maudin grabs it quickly and holds it to your 
throat. "Give me everything you have," he 
hisses, "or I'll finish you off and take it any 
way. Do it now!" The wildness in his eyes 
tells you he is deadly earnest. You can give 
him everything (89) or fight weaponless (90). 

89. You empty your pockets, pack, and 
purse. "There," you curse, "is everything 1 
have of value." "Good," smiles Maudin, 
"now get out." Maudin slams the door 
behind you. You have lost all your treasure 
but not anything listed on the Event Record. 
You are also weaponless. Unless you have 
already picked up another weapon, your fist 
is all you have to fight with until you do so. 
When striking with your fist, you do 1 point 
of damage when you hit, plus any Strength 
bonus. Go to 80. 

90. "Hammer you!" you shout, striking out 
with your fist and shield. Maudin is taken 
aback by the sudden onslaught, but recovers 
quickly enough to defend himself. You are 
weaponless. Your fist is all you have to fight 
with. When striking with your fist, you do 1 
point of damage when you hit, plus any 
Strength bonus. Return to 86 to finish the 
combat, but change the amount of damage 
Maudin does when he hits you to reflect that 
he is using your own weapon. If you win this 
battle, cross off two boxes on the Victory 
Record because of your extraordinary valor. 



Around the bend in the hallway, you see a fat, 
shaggy-haired jailor taunting an ogre that is 
kept behind bars in the room beyond. Thejailor 
must be old Maudin. He is holding a plate of 
food, coaxing the ogre to take it. In his other 
hand, he holds an iron rod. The ogre finally 
reaches for the food, and Maudin yanks it back, 
whacking the creature's knuckles with the rod. 
The creature roars with pain. "Serves you 
right, you stupid beast!" shouts Maudin drunk- 
enly. "If it weren't for you, I'd not be stuck 
here!" You notice a ring ofkeys on his belt. You 
can confront him (92), return to search his 
room (83), or leave (80). 


10 




92. You start forward into the light. The 
ogre's eyes open in surprise, its nostrils flar 
ing. Maudin whirls nimbly for a man of his 
bulk, grabs the torch from the wall, and 
thrusts it at your face. You fend it away, 
knocking it to the floor. Since you have been 
using your infravision, you are confused by 
the sudden influx of bright light as the torch 
swings at your eyes. Maudin the Footpad 
slips into the shadows. You swing wildly, try 
ing to hit him, but a moment later you hear 
the western door close behind you. You are 
locked in the passage! Your eyes clear, and 
you see Maudin laughing at you through a 
small window in the door. "I'm so glad you 
came," he says. "Trudy hasn't had a play 
mate for ever so many days. I'm sure she'd 
love a good meal." He then pulls a lever at his 
side. You hear a bar slide back, unlocking the 
ogre's cell. Spinning, you find yourself face- 
to-face with a hungry ogre. It is impossible to 
retreat. Go to 100. 

93. As the ogre falls to the ground, old Maudin 
lets out a scream of rage. "You filthy goblin- 
bait! You've killed Trudy!" He throws open the 
door and charges you, sword ready. If your hit 
points fall below 6. go immediately to 96. If you 
do 7 points of damage or more to Maudin, go to 
97. If you defeat Maudin, go to 98. 

Maudin (2nd level thief): AC 6; hp 10; 

MV 90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 10; ALC 

94. You dive between Trudy's legs, come up 
behind her, and lash out at her back. The poor 
creature is so confused by hunger that she reacts 
very slowly. Take a free swing at Trudy's back 
and receive automatic initiative on the next 
round. Return to 100 and finish the battle. 

95. With a roar the giant creature scoops you 
up in its crushing grip and throws you at the 
door through with Maudin watches. You land 
with a crack. Take 1-4 points of additional 
damage. You pick yourself up off the floor 
and throw yourself at Trudy. Return to 100 
and finish the battle. 

96. You are near the limits of your endur 
ance. If you wish, you can ask for peace and 
surrender to Maudin (434). Otherwise, 
return to 93 and finish the battle. 

97. You strike out and land a resounding 
blow on Maudin's skull. He drops his 
weapon, sits down in the middle of the hall, 
and begins to moan. "Now what did you do 
that for," he whines. "Poor old Trudy. Oh, 
Trudy, Trudy. Trudy." He turns and throws 
himself over the fallen ogre's form. You easily 
tie the poor soul up. Go to 98. 


98. You wearily bend down, take Maudin's 
keys, and check his pockets for anything of 
value. Roll once for treasure, and cross offG 
on your Event Record. You shake your head 
in disbelief. You straighten your stiff back 
and find yourself facing Trudy's filthy cell. 
You can search it ( 101 ), search Maudin's 
room (83), or return to the hall (80). 



You peer up the short hallway. At the end is 
a set of iron bars. You creep up to them. A 
huge, hairy hand suddenly shoots out from 
between them, almost catching hold of your 
collar! IfG is crossed off your Event Record, 
you can use Maudin's keys to unlock the cell 
and fight the ogre. If so, unlock the cell and 
go to 100. Otherwise, return to the hall (80). 

100. Trudy lunges toward you, swiping at 
you with her huge claw, taking a chunk out of 
your shield. If you are weaponless, you can 
pick up the torch and use it for a weapon. It 
does 1-4 points of damage, but will burn out 
after this battle and be worthless. 

If you roll a 20, go to 94. If Trudy rolls a 
20, go to 95. 

If you defeat Trudy the ogre, go to to 93.

You waste no time sorting through the rags 
and muck. Your ring indicates that there is a 
small secret door halfway up the northern 
wall. It is carved in the shape of a hen sitting 
on her eggs. There is no latch to open the 
door, and you have no way to cut the stone. If 
E is crossed off your Event Record, go to 

102. Otherwise, go to 104. 

102. You can see that one of the hen's eggs is 
missing from the carving. And it is the same 
size as the iron egg you found back in Nimron's 
office! You take the iron egg out of your pack 
and press it into the hollow in the carving. Your 
fingers tingle slightly from the magic, and the 
door swings silently open, revealing forgotten 
dwarven treasures! Inside are a lady's silver 
bracelet (worth 500 gp) and necklace (worth 
1,200 gp), both set with pearls. There is also a 

11 


gold diadem set with rubies (worth 1,650 gp), 
three cut garnets (worth 75 gp each), and three 
phials. Two of the phials' seals are decayed and 
the contents dehydrated, but the third phial 
contains a murky liquid. If you wish to taste it, 
go to 103. Otherwise, there is nothing else here 
of interest and you can return to the hall (80). 

103. Cautiously, you break the phial's seal, pull 
out the cork, and sip the contents. They taste 
horrible, but you feel a surge of energy run 
through your body. One point of damage is 
healed. This is a potion of healing and it con 
tains two doses. Each dose heals 2-7 points of 
damage when you drink it. Be sure to write this 
down on your Equipment List. You look 
around a bit more, but it is obvious there is 
nothing more here. Return to the hall (80). 

104. Indeed, there is no way at all that you 
can open the secret door. After some time, 
you must admit defeat. Go to 80. 



This short, very dusty passage vibrates 
with the sound of thunder. IfH is crossed off 
your Event Record, go to 111. Otherwise, 
you may investigate this hall further (106) or 
return the way you came (either 74 or 81). 

106. You walk through the hall, dust billow 
ing up front your feet. Something is wrong. 
You bend to inspect the stone. Roll Id20. If 
the number is greater than your Wisdom, go 
to 107. Otherwise go to 112. 

107. As you kneel, the floor beneath your feet 
suddenly falls to one side. You try to dig your 
fingernails into the stone as you fall into the 
darkness. Roll Id20. If the number is greater 
than your Dexterity, go to 109. Otherwise, go 
to 108. 

108. As you fall, you grab hold of a rusty chain 
dangling from the trap. You look below your 
feet and see water rushing in from the south. 
Straining, you pull yourself up hand over hand. 
Nimron was crafty. What better treatment for 
unwelcome guests. Suddenly you discover you 
have dropped your weapon and shield. There is 
no way to recover them. Unless you have 
already picked up another weapon, your fist is 
all you have to fight with until you do so. You 
must now raise your AC by 1 until you find 
another shield. Cross H off your Event Record. 
Skirting the hole, from which comes the rushing 
sound of dangerous waters, you can proceed 
north (81) or south (74). 











138. You stalk into the goblin den. The cave 
is full of rubbish, skulls, furs, and totems. 
You can roll for treasure up to five times. If 
the result is a Special Treasure, then add it to 
your equipment and roll again. If the result is 
coins, then multiply the value by 10 and stop 
rolling. Then you can return to the cleaner 
air of the hall (113). 

139. As another of the small goblins collapses 
beneath you, the huge goblin chieftain leaps 
into the fray. He is covered with claw neck 
laces and dirty furs. In his hand is a great 
forked blade. You block the blade aside and 
strike. Finally, the chief collapses at your feet. 
Roll 2d6. If the number is greater than 7, go 
to 142. Otherwise, go to 143. 

140. You fight valiantly, but the goblins are 
taking their toll. You flee. As you flee, the 
goblins receive four free attacks on your back 
at + 4 to hit. If you survive, you must drop 
half your treasure in order to halt their pur 
suit. Go to 14. 

141. Your dwarvish hatred of goblins 
explodes. With a sudden onslaught, you bowl 
over the goblin you face. He trips the two 
standing behind him and they all fall. A few 
quick blows knocks them unconscious. 
Return to 137 and finish the battle. 

142. Slowly, the goblins back away. The larg 
est goblin, however, leaps toward you. "Me 
Kagi," he shouts, "and I now chief! I kill you 
meself!" With a snarl he comes for you. If 
you win, go to 144. 

Kagi: AC 6; HD 1-1; hp 7; MV 90'(30'); 
#AT 1; D 1-6; ML 10; AL C 

143. The goblins try to get out the door and 
drag you down at the same time. Because of 
their confusion, you have the initiative in the 
following rounds. Return to 137 and finish 
thebattle. 

144. With a final blow, Kagi crumbles to the 
floor. The rest of the goblins throw down their 
arms in terror and retreat to the corner of the 
cave. With a short command, you order them 
to bind themselves and be quiet. They do so. 
Go to 138. 



Behind this door is the kitchen. It is hot 
and full of fire and kettles. An obese cook 


stands with his back to you, ordering about 
three goblins that serve him. He is slicing a 
young pig for supper. 

As you open the door, the goblins turn to 
stare at you. The cook continues slicing, 
never once looking up. "Well," he shouts, 
"what do you want? No one is allowed in 
here! You'll have to wait for your supper like 
everyone else." The goblins fear to interrupt 
him, but still strain to get his attention. One 
manages to stutter, "M-m-m-master...." But 
the cook interrupts, "Shut up, or I'll dice you 
into the stew! He throws a piece of tripe over 
his shoulder, and it lands at your feet. A timid 
goblin comes over and tries to shove you out 
the door. You can let him close you out (113) 
or push your way into the kitchen (146). 

146. "Get out of my way," you whisper to the 
goblin. He runs from the kitchen as fast as his 
legs will carry him. You stalk in. The other 
goblins see you coming. They look hopeful 
that you may rid them of the obese terror. 
They scatter, hiding under a cupboard to wit 
ness the inevitable fight. The cook yells after 
them, still too busy to be aware of your 
approach. You notice an empty barrel next to 
him. You raise it up and pop it over his head. 
It falls and sticks around his fat waist. With a 
push, you tip him over and roll him under the 
table. His kicking and muffled shouts alert no 
one. 

You can take a cleaver or knife, cross one 
box off your Victory Record, and roll once 
for treasure. There is a serving window in the 
eastern wall, closed offwith shutters. You can 
peek through it (147) or you can exit to the 
south (113). 

147 


You pause to listen and hear he sounds of 
many voices within. You also smell pipe 
smoke and beer. Peeking in very carefully, 
you see a room full of tables and benches. Ten 
sweaty bandits are seated about, smoking 
and drinking. A large, dirty man clad in 
bearskin looks on. All are absorbed in the 
progress of a dice game and do not notice 
you. It would be suicidal to enter. Return the 
way you came (to either 145 or 148). 


15 



148 

This corridor is well-used and 
fairly clean. You hear a shout of 
joy from behind the western 
door. There are also several 
voices behind the middle door 
on the east. The northernmost 
door on the east seems to be pol 
ished. You can open any door; 
the northern door (149), the 
western door (147), the south 
ern door (105), the northeast 
door (166), the southeast door 
(185). 




As you enter this room, you notice that the 
northern half of the room is immaculate, dec 
orated with fine silk and tasteful art. The 
southern half of the room is a shamble of 
ruined furniture and dirty rugs. Suddenly, 
one of the dirty rugs rears up on its hind legs. 
It is a black bear! If NN is crossed off your 
Event Record, go to 153. Otherwise, you 
may move slowly back out of the room (to 
either 148 or 154) or you can fight (150). 

150. The bear moves toward you. It flexes its 
huge claws. You take the initiative and strike. 
Ifyou win, go to 151. Ifboth the bear's claws 
strike you in the same round, go to 152. 

Bear: AC 6; HD 4; hp 22; MV 120'(40'); 
#AT 2 claws/1 bite; D 1-3/1-3/1-6; ML 7; 
AL N 

151. Rubbing your bruised ribs, you move to 
examine the room. The southern half is a tan 
gled mass of bear hides, skulls, teeth, and 
hair shirts. You find a bag of 50 ep. The beau 
tiful half of the room contains many fine fur 
nishings. There is a set of three golden 
figurines worth about 50 gp each. You may 
exit to the east (154) or the south (148). 

152. You feel both bear claws rake into your 
back, and lock in place. The beast hugs you 
to its chest, picking you up off the floor, caus 
ing an additional 2-16 points of damage. You 
kick and it drops you. If you survive, return 
to 150 and finish the fight. Ifboth the bear's 
claws hit you on the same round again, you 
take another 2-16 points of damage from the 

hug- 

153. The bear does not advance, but sways 
from side to side. Its attention is fixed on your 
chest. It stares at the bearclaw necklace. The 




bear must recognize it as a symbol of com 
mand! Testing your idea, you approach slowly. 
The bear backs away. You point to the floor in 
the comer, and the bear retreats there. You can 
exit to the east (154) or south (148). 



You find yourself in a bedrdom. On the 
northern wall is a canopied bed draped in silk 
and satin, layered with pillows. On the south 
wall is a cot covered with fur throws. You may 
investigate (155), exit through the secret 
door your ring outlines on wall (159) or exit 
to the west (149). 

155. You quickly look through the dirty furs 
but find nothing. If there is anything of value 
in this room it should be under the bed. How 
ever, you find nothing there or in the side- 
table. You see that a section section of the 
bed's carved headboard does not fit properly. 
You may investigate (156), or exit through 
the secret door (159) or through the western 
door (149). 

156. Inside the compartment is a small bag of 
50 gp and a phial of red liquid labelled "Poi 
son for sword. If you wish to use the liquid on 
your weapon, cross FF off your Event 
Record. If you wish to sip the liquid, go to 

157. You can also exit through the secret door 
(159) or the western door (149). 

157. You sip the liquid. For a brief moment 
you feel stronger, inspired. The feeling fades 
quickly, but you know you have a potion of 
heroism. Mark it on your Equipment List. 
You can now exit through the secret door 
(159) or the western door (149). 

158. You skirt the mountain and find the 
small waterfall. Following his directions, you 
creep underneath the overhanging ledge, so 
that you are between the waterfall and the 
mountainside. The ring on your finger tin 
gles and you see witchfire outline a secret 
door in the rock. You open it and creep 
inside. Go to 160. 



You are in a small dusty room. There is no 
sign of life. Your ring outlines a secret door on 
the west. A set of rough stairs leads up. Some of 
the steps look wet and slippery. You can open 
the secret door (154) or climb the stairs (161). 


160. You are at the top of a short flight of 
rough hewn steps. It is dark, but you can tell 
that the cuts in the stone are fresh. Water is 
dripping, and some of the steps look slippery. 
You can proceed down the stairs into Paradise 
and Thunderdelve (161) or go outside (162). 

161. You proceed carefully on the dark, slip 
pery stairs, your infravision used to full 
capacity. Roll Id20. If the number is greater 
than your Dexterity, go to 163. Otherwise, go 
to 164. 

162. You are on a spray-drenched ledge 
between a waterfall and the mountainside. 
This must be the secret entrance Nimron 
described. There are no clues here. You can 
either go back downstairs (160) or go around 
the mountain and to the front gate (13). 

163. You slip and fall, hitting your chin on 
the edge of a step. Take 1-4 points of damage. 
If you survive, go to 165. 

164. You nearly slip on the slimy steps, but 
catch yourself. If you are leaving Thunder- 
delve, go to 162. If you are entering Thun 
derdelve, go to 159. 

165. You feel dizzy and lose consciousness. A 
while later, you again become aware of your 
surroundings. They are unfamiliar. You may 
be lost inside Thunderdelve. Confused, you 
compare your surroundings to your map. Go 
to 207. 



You open the polished door. Inside is a 
dimly lit room of tapestries, elegant couches, 
thick rugs, and rare furs. Suddenly out of the 
dark northern corner, a spear flies at your 
chest. Roll to see if it hits, using the 1st level 
Fighter column. If it hits, it does 1-6 points of 
damage. If you survive, go to 167. 

167. You see a bandit guard charge at you 
from the dark. He opens his mouth to sound 
an alarm. You must attack instantly to silence 
him. If you win in the first round, go to 168. 
If you do not win in the first round, go to 169. 

Guard (2nd level thief): AC 6; hp 8; 
MV 90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 8; AL C 

168. Realizing the consequences if an alarm 
was raised, you silence the guard with one blow. 
Roll once for treasure. You can exit to the main 
hall (148) or through the northern door (174). 


169. The guard blocks nearly your every 
move. "Alarm! Foe!" he cries. You must 
work quickly before reinforcements arrive. 
Run one round of combat. If you defeat him 
this round, go to 170. Otherwise, if GG is 
crossed off your Event Record, go to 173. If 
not, go to 171. 

Guard (2nd level thief): AC 6; hp 8; 
MV 90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 8; AL C 

170. If GG is crossed off your Event Record, 
go to 173. You give the guard one final blow 
and he falls. You hear feet in the hall and drag 
the guard's body back into the dark northern 
corner, then duck behind a tapestry. The door 
opens, and you hear several men enter. "You 
see? I told you Magry, there ain't no alarm. 
You're hearing things." You hear the door 
slam and you peek out. They're gone. Roll 
once for treasure. You can exit to the west 
(148) or the north (174). 

171. As you dodge another of the guard's 
blows, the western door flies open and four men 
enter. "By Nargox, Magry, you was right. You 
did hear something." You back up to the wall so 
only three can attack you at once. The four look 
like theyjust woke up. They have no armor but 
a shield. If you win, go to 172. 

5 Bandits (2nd level thieves): AC 6; hp 5 
each; MV 90'(30'); D 1-8; ML 8; AL C 


172. You sink into a sofa and strain not to fall 
asleep. With a shake of your head you rise. 
You must find Grona! Roll 5 times for trea 
sure. Cross GG off your Event Record. You 
can exit to the north (174) or west (148). 

173. You strike out at the bewildered guard. 
"Waldo! Magry!" he shouts, "Help me!" 
You can finish the fight alone. If you win. go 
to 172.

Inside is a lavish bedchamber full of rich 
goods. You scan the room, and your eyes lock 
on a large chest. If DD is crossed off your 
Event Record, go to 179. Otherwise, go to 
180. 

175. You probe for traps. Roll Id20. If the 
number is greater than your Wisdom, go to 

176. Otherwise, go to 181. 


16 



176. You find no . As you throw open the lid, 
you feel the floor beneath you give way. You 
fall 20 feet, taking 2-8 points of damage. The 
pit is full of spikes. You must roll 4 spear 
attacks against yourself using the 4th level 
Fighter column. Each spear hit causes 1-6 
points of damage. If you survive, go to 177. 

177. Moaning, you look up the steep walls of 
the pit. You are trapped until Redface 
returns. If DD is crossed off your Event 
Record, go to 182. Otherwise, go to 183. 

178. You go to the large chest and examine it. 
It appears to be unlocked and untrapped. You 
can check for traps and then open it (175), or 
return to the main hall (148). 

179. Suddenly you hear movement and see a 
young pageboy cowering behind the bed. It is 
Davie. He watches you apprehensively. 
"Stay where you are and I won't hurt you," 
you say. He nods. "How'd you get here?" 
you ask. "Waldo came and got me to wait 
here for Redface." "If I have my way, you'll 
never have to worry about Redface again," 
you assure him. You turn your attention back 
to the chest. Go to 178. 

180. You hear sudden movement and see a 
young pageboy cowering behind the bed. 
"Stay where you are," you mutter, "and I'll 
not hurt you." He nods mutely, and you turn 
back to the chest. Go to 178. 

181. You examine the chest, but find no trap. 
To be safe, you pull away the rugs in front of 
the chest and examine the floor. It is hinged 
and will probably open into a pit when the 
chest lid is raised. You move aside and open 
the lid. The floor falls, revealing a 20-foot 
drop into a spike-filled pit. Go to 184. 

182. You wait. Finally, a large man with a half- 
bearded, half-scarred face peers into the trap. If 
must be Redface. "Well, well," laughs Redface. 
"Look what we caught." He then pulls a lever 
hidden behind a tapestry and the lid to the trap 
swings back up, plunging you into darkness. 
There is no answer. You have lost this character 
and must choose a new one. 

183. A heavy blanket is thrown down into the 
pit. You see the page at thing the other end. 
"Climb up," he whispers, "and I'll secure 
this end around the bedpost." You clamber 
up out of the pit. If you wish, you can reward 
him with some of your treasure. Then you 
turn eagerly to the open chest against the 
wall. Go to 184. 

184. Inside the chest is an earl's ransom. The 
chest contains three bags of assorted gems 


(worth 2,000 gp total), an emerald necklace 
(worth 2,500 gp), two gold armbands (worth 
250 gp each), 500 sp, and 450 gp. A small 
satin bag also holds a ring sculpted in the 
shape of a wolfs head. As you take it out, the 
page cries: "Redface will be angry if you take 
that! It's the mate to his own ring that he uses 
to train his wolves." If you want to wear the 
armbands, mark off JJ on your Event 
Record. If you want to wear the ring, cross 
off I on your Event Record. Return to the 
main hall (148). 

185 



You can hear voices. You open the door 
cautiously. If GG is crossed off your Event 
Record, go to 188. Otherwise, go to 186. 

186. The reason you hear voices is that the 
room's occupants are standing next to the 
door. One of them throws the door open. You 
fall into the room and and find yourself su- 
rounded by four bandits. They are armored, 
but quick grab their swords. "Well, well," 
mutters one without any teeth, "another 
half-sized renegade. "What should we do 
with it, Magry?" asks a skinny one. "Sup 
pose we ought to report it to Trist," sighs one 
without a shirt. He looks at another bandit, a 
big man with bulging biceps, and asks: 
"What do you think. Waldo?" "We're off 
duty," growls Waldo, "so it ain't none of our 
business." He points a thick finger at you. 
"You give us 50 gold apiece and we'll call it 
even. You ain't seen us, and we ain't seen 
you." You can pay them the 200 gp if you 
have them (or their equivalent) and leave 
(148) or you can fight (187). Ifyou pay them, 
cross GG off your Event Record. 


der out the door, grumbling. Cross GG off your 
Event Record. You can exit to the hall (148) or 
stay and look around (188).

Harsh vapors assail your nostrils as you enter 
this deserted place. Two sets of stairs, one lead 
ing up, the other down, are to the west. Both 
are labelled with runes. To read them, see 
Inscription 4. Beyond is a golden door on the 
western wall. Beyond that a huge crevasse has 
ripped through this section of Thunderdelve. 
Out of this pit rise the noxious vapors. You can 
not see the bottom of the pit, and it is too wide to 
jump. Directly to the south, you can see the 
hallway and a few doors. There is no way for 
you to reach them. You can also make out a few 
dark shapes in front of the doors, but cannot tell 
what they are. 

You walk along the narrow crumbling edge 
extending to the east, but it leads nowhere. 
To the south, across the pit, you can see 
another ledge on which rest a few charred 
bunks and stools. You may exit through the 
northern door (14), the golden door on the 
west (200). go upstairs (191) or go down 
stairs (199). 


187. You lash out at the unarmored bandits. 
They can attack simultaneously. If you defeat 
two of the bandits (including Waldo, 7 hp), go 
to 189. If you defeat all the bandits, go to 188.

191. As you climb, the air grows clearer. As 
you round a corner onto a landing, you kick a 
dwarf skeleton. It looks many years old. As 
you look around, you see skeletons of small 
and large animals mingled with the drop 
pings of some large beast. You can open the 
door at the top of the stairs (192) or return 
back downstairs (190). 


188. You are in an empty dingy barracks. 
You rummage through moth-eaten blankets 
and sagging bunks. If this is your first time 
here, roll four times for treasure, and return 
to the hall (148). 

189. "All right! Enough!" shout the other two 
bandits. "We've got pillage duty in 10 minutes. 
If you can find anything in this muck, you're

The room is lit by natural sunlight filtering 
in through ivy-covered windows. You are 


17 







high atop the mountain in the old watch 
tower. The room is littered with bones and 
offal. The glint of gold shines here and there. 
As you begin to investigate, you hear a flap 
ping of wings, and a gargoyle crawls in 
through a window. There may be time to 
retreat (195) or you may fight (196). If you 
have no magical weapons, you must retreat 
(195). The gargoyle cannot be damaged by 
normal weapons. 

193. In disgust you pick up the body and 
throw it out the window. Among the rubble 
you find 200 gp, a golden belt (worth 1,500 
gp), and a silver buckle (worth 20 gp). There 
is also a sealed flask made of gold (worth 30 
gp). You can sample its contents (194) or 
return downstairs (190). 

194. You sip at the liquid and feel a surge of 
energy. You feel nimble and the speed of your 
reactions is amazing. You found a potion of 
speed. Record it on your Equipment List and 
return downstairs (190). 

195. The gargoyle hurls itself at you, bowling 
you over into the refuse. It then turns and 
slams the door shut. You lash out at it, but 
your blow glances off its hide, numbing your 
hand. It shrieks, and rakes at you. You retreat 
across the room, pull out your most valuable 
piece of treasure or all of your gold, and 
throw it out the window. The gargoyle 
screams and flies out after it. You run back 
downstairs (190). 

196. With a screech, the gargoyle turns and 
leaps at you. If you roll a 20, go to 197. If the 
gargoyle's roll is 18 or higher, go to 198. If 
you win. go to 193.

197. You hit hard, stunning the beast. You 
push it out a window and can go downstairs 
(190) or wait for it to come back (return to 
196 and finish the fight). 

198. The gargoyle hugs you to its chest and 
tumbles backward out a window. As it soars 
above the mountain, it opens its arms to let 
you fall but you grab hold of its tail. Franti 
cally, you beat at the gargoyle's legs with your 
weapon. It writhes in mid-air, trying to throw 
you off. It will not be able to hold you both in 
the air for long. Unable to shake you, it lands 
on the mountain. You let go and the fight 
begins anew. If you win, you must return to 
the front gate (1) or the secret door (158).

199. You proceed slowly through the loose 
rubble littering the way. As you go deeper, the 
vapors become thicker, and you find breath 
ing difficult. Just as you are about to turn 
back for lack of air, the stairs end in a great 
fall of rock and stone. The mines are sealed 
off. You climb back to the hall (190). 


200 



Behind the golden door is a barracks cov 
ered by a thick layer of dust. Roll once for 
treasure. The southeast corner of the room 
has been destroyed and a few vapors waft in 
through the gap. As you draw closer, you see 
thntrittmigbvtoefpinaxifflisfaotamirnbdcaaihtiiir 

room farther to the south, by hanging onto 
the wall, edging around the pit, and swinging 
into the southern room. There is no other 
way of reaching that room from this area. 
You can swing across the pit (201), exit 
through the northern door (207), or exit 
through the eastern door (190). 

201. You take a firm hold on the wall and 
begin edging across. Then you try to swing 
over the pit. Roll Id20. If the number is 
greater than your Dexterity, go to 203. Oth 
erwise, go to 202. 

202. You swing to the far side and land, your 
feet wobbling precariously on the crumbling 
edge. At the last moment, you throw yourself 
forward and fall safely to the floor as the ledge 
behind you breaks off. There is no going 
back. Go to 209. 

203. As you swing, you lose your grip and 
slip. You tear your nails into the stone to 
catch yourself and reach for the ledge. Des 
perately, you try to find a hole for your toes as 
the vapors reach up to claim you. Roll Id20. 
If the number is greater than your Strength, 
go to 204. Otherwise, go to 205. 

204. The ledge you hang on crumbles, drop 
ping you into the abyss below. You fall 200 
feet into the mine landing. Take 20-200 
points of damage. If you survive, go to 206. 

205. The ledge begins to crumble. You drag 
yourself back up into safety and roll over 
quickly, as the ledge slides down into the dark 
ness below. You have reached the room to the 


south, but there is no going back. Go to 209. 


206. Unless someone comes to the pit with a 
long rope and hears your feeble cries for help, 
you are trapped. The mines lay in ruin and 
there is no way out. You have lost this charac 
ter and must choose' a new one. 


207 



This passage is littered with boots, shirts, 
axes, and belts. You can investigate (208), 
climb the northern stairs and open the narrow 
door at the top (47), or exit to the south (200). 

208. You find a purse containing 35 ep. You 
also see a mithril dagger + 1 lying in a rotten 
leather sheath studded with small opals 
(worth 110 gp). You can climb the northern 
stairs and open the narrow door at the top 
(47) or exit to the south (200). 

209 



You find yourself on a ledge that was once 
the floor of this room. A mithril door leads to 
the east. The pit lies in the heart of this room, 
which was once a barracks. Skeletons lie on 
the floor and beds. You can look for a clue to 
their fate (214) or exit through the only 
remaining door (211). 

210. You shake visibly from this experience. 
Glancing about the room and you spot a bone 
and silver brooch on one of the skeletons. It 
appears to be worth about 900 gp. If you take it, 
cross J off your Event Record. The only exit 
from this room is the mithril door on the east (211) 


211 


This short stretch of corridor originally 
connected up farther north across the pit, but 



18 




has been cut off. The only exits are the door 
on the east, a mithril door on the west, or a 
long jump down. There are several dwarf 
skeletons here. Between the skeletons is a 
chest. You may open it (212), exit to the east 
(230), or exit through the mithril door on the 
west (209). 

212. You open the chest cautiously. Inside are 
50 pp, a partially completed crown (worth 500 
gp), a diamond bracelet (worth 1,000 gp), and a 
sealed phial. You may sample the phial (213), 
exit to the east (230) or exit to the west (209). 

213. You sip the phial but you can tell some 
thing is wrong. You spit repeatedly, trying to 
get the bitter liquid out of your mouth. Make 
a Saving Throw vs. Poison. If you succeed, 
go to 215. If you fail, go to 216. 

214. All you find is their remains and the dim 
shadows cast by the shifting vapors. The 
shadows are really the creatures of living 
darkness, and three of them attack you! If 
you are hit, go to 217. If you roll higher than 
a 17, go to 219. If you are defeated, go to 
218. If you win, go to 210. If you have no 
magical weapon, go to 221. 

Shadows: AC 7; HD 2+2*; hp 9,11,17; 
MV90Y30'); #AT 1 touch; D 1-4 + spe 
cial; ML 12; AL C 

215. You choke a bit more but cough up most 
of the foul liquid. Take 1-8 points of damage. 
If you survive, go to 220. 

216. You feel faint and fall to the ledge, 
nearly tumbling over. Take 2-16 points of 
damage. If you survive, go to 220. 

217. A shadow's amorphous hand passes into 
your chest. You feel a cold hand take hold of 
your heart. Take 1-4 points of damage, and 
reduce your Strength by 1 point. If your 
Strength falls to 0, go to 218. 

218. You feel your body lighten. Your armor 
and clothing fall to the floor. You, too, are 
now a shadow and will remain here to haunt 
this room. This character has been defeated. 
You must choose a new one. 

219. With a mighty power you strike out. 
The heat of your passion passes into your 
blow, causing it to do double damage to the 
cold creature before you. Return to 214 and 
finish the battle. 

220. You lie still for a while, but soon the cold of 
the stone begins to tempt you to sleep and 
dream. With a start, you sit up, realizing what 


happened to the dwarves that slept here before 
you. Rising, you throw the phial far into the pit. 
You do not hear it smash below. You may exit to 
the east (230) or to the west (209). 

221. In near-panic, you strike out at the 
blackness before you. Your blow passes 
harmlessly through the form. Without a 
magic weapon, you must retreat. The 
shadows receive three + 4 attacks at your 
back as you flee. If you are hit, go to 222. If 
you survive, go to 211.

222. A shadow's amorphous hand passes into 
your chest. You feel a cold hand take hold of 
your heart. Take 1-4 points of damage, and 
reduce your Strength by 1 point. If your 
Strength falls to 0, go to 218. Otherwise, 
return to 221 and finish the shadows' attacks. 
You lose an additional Strength point each 
time you are hit. 



Evil-smelling fumes roll over you. You are 
standing on a landing. Stairs lead down. 
Something massive has battered the stairs 
into featureless rubble not far from where you 
stand. You could never descend the slope 
safely. You turn to leave, then notice that your 
ring outlines a secret door on the west. You 
can open this secret door (224) or return to 
the main hall (24). 

224 


You open the door slowly, gagging slightly 
on the nauseous fumes. This is the great vault 
ofNimron. Treasure lies everywhere. In your 
excitement, you begin to rush forward, but 
materializing out of the darkness and advanc 
ing toward you is a pale, semi-transparent 
wraith! There is still time to flee back to the 
great hall (24), or you may stay and fight 

226. If you have no magical weapon, you 
cannot harm the wraith and must flee (24). 

225. You shake off the chill surrounding this 
foul creature. The vault now seems somehow 
cleaner, and you are no longer troubled by the 
presence you felt earlier in Nimron's office. You 
scan the vault. It is rich with treasure. There are 
silver ingots (worth 3,000 sp), 100 pp. 1.000 gp, 
a golden and mithril helm (worth 3,000 gp), 



and three phials plainly labeled in Nimron's 
scrawling hand. To read the labels, see Inscrip 
tion 5. Record these items on your Equipment 
List. You will not be able to carry the coins and 
ingots though, unless you have a bag of hold 
ing. If you wish to wear the helm, mark off II 
on your Event Record. Return now to the main 
hall (24). 

226. You stand firm as the voiceless horror 
rushes toward you. If you are hit, go to 227. 
If you roll a 20, go to 229. If you lose, go to 
228. If you win, go to 225.

227. The wraith's bony finger dodges around 
your parry and touches you lightly on the 
chin. You feel a jolt of electric magnetism, 
taking 1-6 points of damage and instantly los 
ing one level of experience. If you survive, 
return to 226 and finish the fight. Each time 
you are hit, you lose one level of experience. 

228. You feel yourself dissolve into the dark 
ness of the netherworld and look up to face 
your new companion. He is a grim-faced 
dwarf named Olic. You have lost this charac 
ter and must choose a new one. 

229. You smash the creature back against the 
wall, pummeling it again and again, causing 
double damage to it. You automatically 
receive the initiative in the following rounds. 
Return to 226 and finish the fight.

IfKK is crossed off your Event Record, go 
to 232. 

This room holds furnishings for three 
dwarves. Ten skeletons lay about. The door 
on the east is barricaded shut. What could 
have been so terrible that these dwarves bar 
ricaded themselves in here to their dooms? 
You may unbarricade the door and find out 
(231) or return to the west (211). 

231. Slowly, you remove the rubble that has 
been piled in front of the door. It is arduous 
work and you find yourself sweating heavily. 
You have no doubt that 50 years has not 
affected whatever horror lies behind this 
door. Gradually you clear a way and lay your 
hand on the door's ring. Slowly, you pull the 


19 




door open. Cross KK off your Event Record 
and go to 240. 

232. As you reenter this room, you spot a 
glitter among the rubble. You clean around 
the spot and uncover a bag studded with 
gems (worth 250 gp). You test its carrying 
capacity. Little by little you add your wealth. 
You have found a bag of holding. You can exit 
this room to the east (240) or the west (211). 

233 



The northwest corner of the room has dis 
appeared into the pit. The vapors there are 
particularly thick. From the remnants of the 
room, you can tell that it was the living quar 
ters for three fairly important dwarves. Their 
beds, table, and chairs are of fine construc 
tion; the walls are hung with once-fine tapes 
tries. All are now charred and blackened by 
fire. A great axe hangs on the east wall, and a 
singed chest sits in the southeast corner. You 
may investigate further (236), or exit to the 
north (256) or south (240). 

234. You shake your head, trying to clear the 
dizziness. You look around, then recall that 
you were about to open a chest. Kneeling 
next to the chest, you grip the lid. It crumbles 
in your now-blackened hands. Inside this pile 
of charcoal are 100 sp, two turquoise stones 
worth 20 gp each, a set of beautiful gaming 
pieces (worth about 50 gp), and a phial. 
Unfortunately, the great axe's haft is too 
badly burnt to serve as a weapon. You may 
sip the phial's contents (235), exit to the 
north (256). or exit to the south (240). 

235. You sip cautiously and feel a cool tin 
gling for a moment, and then it fades. From 
experience you know this is a potion of fire 
resistance. Record it on your Equipment 
List. You may now exit to the north (256) or 
south (240). 


237. The vapor ghoul's arms lengthen, reach 
past your defenses, and grasp your head. You 
feel a shock; take 1-4 points of damage, and lose 
one point of Intelligence. If your Intelligence 
falls to 0, you are defeated. If you survive, 
return to 236 and finish the fight. You lose one 
point of Intelligence each time you are hit. 

238. You lash out with your strong arm, 
sweeping through the metaplasmic form of 
the ghoul, dissolving it into harmless vapor. 
Roll 2d6. If the number is greater than 9, go 
to 239. Otherwise, return to 236 and finish 
the fight. 

239. The other ghoul wails and returns to 
vapor, disappearing back into the pit. Go to 
234. 



The eastern end of this room has collapsed 
into the pit, except for a narrow bridge lead 
ing over the chasm and to the east. A sickly, 
snake-like stench fills the air. This room is 
filled with sword racks and suits ofchainmail. 
Old shields and axes hang from the walls. 
The armor is rusty but serviceable. The 
weapons are serviceable but are at -2 to hit 
because of dullness. You may take a sword, 
axe, shield, and suit of chainmail if you lack 
them. You may investigate this room further 
(243), exit to the north (233), or exit to the 
west (244). 

241. In disgust, you kick the bloated red 
bodies off the bridge. Straining, you stand on 
tiptoe and take down the great hammer. It 
throbs in your hands, its might immediately 
manifest. If C is crossed off your Event 
Record, go to 245. Otherwise, go to 246. 

242. You feel the hammer trying to control 
you, but with a wrench of self-discipline, you 
retain control. Cross K off your Event 
Record and go to Section S3. 


236. As you approach the chest, you see the 
swirling vapors thicken before you into the 
ghost-like forms of two vapor ghouls. You can 
retreat before they form, or stay and fight. If 
you have no magical weapon, you cannot 
harm the vapor ghouls and must retreat. If 
you are hit, go to 237. If you kill one, go to 
238. If you win, go to 234.

243. Surely this room is the old armory. You 
look about for a special table or chest, but see 
none. Hanging on a fragment of the eastern 
wall that drops down front the ceiling over the 
bridge, is a great hammer of pure mithril, 
studded with emeralds and diamonds. It 
matches the description of the legendary 
Hammer of Vitroin. You can sense power 
radiating from it. If you do not take the ham 
mer, you can exit to the north (233), west 
(244), or east across the bridge (365). Or you 
can go to the hammer and take it down (247). 


244. You push at the door. If KK is crossed 
off your Event Record, go to 230. Otherwise, 
go to 249. 

245. Suddenly, a pure light shines forth from 
the hammer and it speaks. "I read the pur 
pose in your mind and know you have no 
right to take me. The Clanmaster has not so 
spoken. Replace me." You feel a powerful 
wrenching in your mind and begin to replace 
the hammer. You struggle to master your own 
body, but the power of the hammer is too 
great. You replace the hammer high on the 
wall and turn to exit. It is apparent that no 
bandits live in this section of Thunderdelve. 
Grona could not possibly be here. You may 
exit to the north (233) or east across the 
bridge (365). 

246. You have done your duty for Nimron. 
Now you must return with the hammer and 
Grona Marblefist. With it, she may be healed. 
As you begin to leave the room, a bright light 
shines forth from the hammer, and it speaks, "I 
sense your desire to leave Paradise. I would 
know why." You look down at the hammer and 
reply, "I must take you to Grona Marblefist, 
your Keeper. She is in need of your healing, 
that she may return and combat the fyrsnaca 
that has ruined these halls." The hammer 
speaks again, "The Keeper's health is not my 
concern. Too long have I hung here useless. Are 
you not a dwarf? If there be a fyrsnaca, take me 
yourself and together we shall combat it." To 
battle the fyrsnaca is in conflict with your agree 
ment with Nimron. Suddenly, the hammer 
resists you mightily. You must make a Control 
check. One of you will gain mastery over the 
other. Add your Intelligence and Wisdom 
scores. This is your Will. If you are wounded, 
you must roll Id8 and subtract 1-8 points from 
your Will. If your Will is then greater than 14, 
go to 242. Otherwise, go to 247. 

247. You move onto the bridge and reach up 
to grasp the hammer, but before you take it, 
you feel something tug at your feet and try to 
pull you off the bridge. While trying to regain 
your balance, you look down and see four 
red, bloated worms writhing about your legs. 
They crawled out of the pit when you reached 
for the hammer, almost as if they were guard 
ing it. You are trapped on the bridge, and you 
must fight with whatever weapon you already 
have. When you are bitten, go to 254. If a 
worm's roll is 1, go to 250. If a worm's roll is 
20, go to 251. If you roll 20, go to 252. If you 
win, go to 241. If you lose, go to 253.

248. Your will melts. You realize that you will 
never be able to take the hammer from Thun- 
derdelve but that you are just as capable of 
facing a fyrsnaca as is Grona Marblefist. You 
will find the fyrsnaca and slay it yourself with 
the help of the hammer. The hammer has 
taken complete control ofyou. You can use no 
other weapon, and you cannot leave Thun- 
derdelve until the fyrsnaca is destroyed. If 
this character is slain, your next character 
will be under the same prohibition. You may 
exit to the north (233), the west (244), or east 
across the bridge (365). 

249. The door is barred from the other side. 
You take one of the axes off the wall and chop 
a hole in it big enough to crawl into the other 
room, but in order to do so, you must writhe 
your way through much debris and many 
pieces of rock and beam. Your foot becomes 
caught between two rocks and pull with all 
your might. You are free, but the rubble 
behind you collapses, blocking your return to 
the east. You could clear it away, but it would 
take time. Go to 230. 

250. One of the worms lunges at your feet. 
You step quickly aside, and it falls off the 
bridge, never to be seen again. Return to 247 
and finish the battle. 

251. The worm bites at your arm, and you 
parry with your weapon. Savagely, the worm 
snaps at your weapon, bites it in two and 
swallows it, leaving only the handle in your 
fist. If you have another weapon, you may 
draw it but cannot attack that round. If you 
have no other weapon, you must fight with 
your fist, causing 1 point of damage plus any 
Strength Bonus per hit. Return to 247 and 
finish the battle. 

252. The mass of crimson flesh throws itself 
at your knees, knocking you to the bridge. 
Immediately, you are buried under a worm. 
The worm rears back, its hungry mouth 
watering for its meal. You take advantage of 
its position and sit up. twisting your legs out 
from under the creature and hacking at it 
with your weapon. It falls from the bridge. 
Return to 247 and finish the battle. 

253. With a final vicious attack, the worm bites 
at your forearm and holds on. You beat at it, 
trying to free yourself, but you are too weak. 
You try to pull away, but step back into the 
empty space beyond the bridge's edge. You fall 
backward into the abyss, dragging the gro 
tesque worm with you. This character has been 
defeated, and you must choose a new one. 

254. Hundreds of the worm's razor-like teeth 
rasp against your leg. You feel a burning sen 


sation. You must make a Saving Throw vs. 
Poison each time you are bitten, or suffer 
double damage. If you survive, return to 247 
and finish the battle. 



This short hall has been divided by a great 
crevasse. From the depths of the pit, you hear 
a dull rumbling. A large part of this region 
has been swallowed into the pit which extends 
to the south and west. You cannot see the bot 
tom. but can detect the foul-smelling vapors 
that swirl from it. 

Across the pit is part of your hall leading to 
a blackened door. The pit here is only ten feet 
wide. You might be able to jump it. but the 
southern ledge is crumbling. It would cer 
tainly break off and plunge you to your 
death. As you peer over the pit's edge, you 
feel a tingling presence run up your spine. 
You turn and see a dim form coalescing from 
the vapors. It is a vapor ghoul. You are 
trapped between it and the pit. If you do not 
have a magical weapon, go to 261. If you are 
hit, go to 259. If you roll a 20, go to 260. If 
you win, go to 257.

256 


You open the door and step out onto a 
ledge-all that remains of a hallway swallowed 
into the pit. Stepping on a weak part of the 
ledge, you feel it crumble beneath your feet. 
You catch hold of the charcoaled doorframe just 
as the ledge slides into the pit. As you dangle 
over the vaporous void, you see your weapon 
and shield fall. Cursing, you pull yourself back 
up into the shelter of the southern room. Unless 
you have an extra weapon, you must fight with 
your bare fists until you find one. When strik 
ing, you will cause 1 point of damage plus any 
Strength Bonus. Also, you must raise your AC 
by 1 point until you find another shield. Go to 
233. 

257. You lean back against the wall and try to 
clear the fuzziness from your head. The 



vapor ghoul condenses into a pool ofliquid on 
the floor. You dimly recall a legend that good 
may come of drinking this ghoul's essence, or 
that by saving it, potions of unclead control 
may be distilled. Ifyou wish to drink the foul 
smelling liquid, go to 258. Otherwise, return 
to the north (74). 

258. You feel immediately strengthened and 
2-7 points of damage are healed. Also, you 
regain 2-7 points of Intelligence (if you lost 
any). Now you must return to the north (74). 

259. The vapor ghoul's arms lengthen, reach 
past your defenses, and grasp your head. You 
feel a shock, take 1-4 points of damage, and 
lose 1 point of Intelligence. If your Intelli 
gence falls to 0, you are defeated. If you sur 
vive, return to 255 and finish the fight. You 
lose one point of Intelligence each time you 
are hit. 

260. You lash out with your strong arm, 
sweeping through the metaplasmic form of 
the ghoul, dissolving it into harmless vapor. 
You have won. Go to 257. 

261. Trapped between the ghoul and the pit, 
you have no magic. Fear threatens to para 
lyze both your mind and body. Logic dictates 
that you have only two choices. You must 
either try to rush through the vapor ghoul 
(262) or jump the 10-foot pit, hoping the 
crumbling ledge to the south will hold long 
enough for you to scramble through the far 
door (263). 

262. You throw your arms in front and swing 
your weapon madly. The vapor ghoul hesi 
tates. You rush by, but not before it reaches 
out to grab you with a misty hand. The vapor 
ghoul receives one + 4 attack as you pass. If 
you are hit, go to 264. If you are not hit, 
return to the hall (74). 

Vapor ghoul; AC 2; HD 3*; hp 15;

special; ML 9; AL C 

263. As the misty creature rushes forward, 
you leap the pit to the far ledge. A large piece 
of it breaks off, and you throw yourself for 
ward, catching hold of the doorframe. But 
you cannot pull yourself up. Your shield and 
weapon hinder you. Either they or you must 
go into the pit. You drop them, then swing up 
into the southern room. Unless you have an 
extra weapon, you must fight with your fists 
until you find one. When striking, you will 
cause 1 point of damage plus any Strength 
Bonus. Also, you must raise your AC by 1 
point until you find another shield. Go to 
233. 


21 


264. The vapor ghoul's arms lengthen, reach 
past your defenses, and grasp your head. You 
feel a shock and lose 1 point of Intelligence. If 
your Intelligence falls to 0, you are defeated. 
If you survive, you find yourself safely in the 
hall. The vapor ghoul will not leave its resting 
place to pursue you. 


265 



This enormous, once-festive hall is now in 
ruins. Charred tables, benches, and skeletons 
lay tumbled together where they fell during 
the sudden and fiery onslaught of the 
fyrsnaca. The room is filled with the sound of 
dull thunder constantly booming in the dis 
tance. An enormous gent glows high up on a 
central pillar. You have heard of this fabled 
uncut stone, the Heir's Stone. It was left 
exactly where it was found when the dwarves 
were excavating this hall. Standing at the 
base of the pillar is a statue of a happy dwarf, 
his arms thrown wide in greeting. 

You take account of the exits now. The 
great doors leading to the west (74) are coated 
with rnithril. The smaller doors on the north 
(281) and south (306) have both been blasted 
off their hinges or burned away. Above the 
northern and southern doors are more runes. 
To read them, see Inscription 6. A great arch 
in the eastern wall opens onto a descending 
flight of stairs (366). 

As you enter the hall, you sense move 
ment. You look around and notice the statue 
of the dwarf is moving toward you, its face 
carved into a smile, its fists clenched. You 
know these dwarven statues are controlled by 


a key word but you do not know it. If both L 
and Y are crossed off your Event Record, go 
immediately to 270. If L is crossed off your 
Event Record, go to 269. If Y is crossed off 
your Event Record, go to 272. Otherwise, 
you may retreat back the way you came (to 
either 74, 281, 366, or 306), or you can try 
to dodge around the statue and reach the exit 
of your choice. If you dodge, read entry 266. 

266. As you move past the statue, it lunges 
for you. It moves faster than you do, but 
hopefully your reactions are quicker. Roll 
Id20. If the number is greater than your Dex 
terity, go to 271. Otherwise, go to 267. 

267. You dodge aside, nearly tripping over a 
burned trestle, but making it safely to an exit: 
west (74), north (281), east (366), or south 
(306). You have not defeated the statue. He 
will await your return. If you try to recross 
the hall, you will have to dodge again. 

268. The statue crumbles. Nothing is left but 
half a face. However, there is more here than 
rock. You stoop and scoop up an enormous 
ruby (worth 6,000 gp). It is the statue's heart! 
If you take it, cross M off your Event Record. 
You may exit the hall to the west (74), north 
(281), east (366), or south (306). Or you can 
investigate the pillar of Heir's Stone, now 
that the guardian statue has been dispatched 
(277). You can now freely reenter the hall. 

269. You remember the manuscript you read 
in the library. "Heir's Arm!" you shout. The 
statue stops, bows to you, then returns to its 
original position. You may exit the hall to the 
west (74), north (281), east (366), or south 
(306). Or you can investigate the pillar of 
Heir's Stone (277). 

270. You have received instructions about 
this statue from the library scroll and from 
Chalcidar. If you wish to follow the scroll's 
advice, go to 269. If you wish to follow 
Chalcidar's advice, go to 272. 

271. You dodge around the stone dwarf, but 
he is too quick for you. He grabs hold of your 
arm and begins to crush it in his vice-like 
grip. If you hit and do at least 8 points of 
damage in one blow, go to 273. If the statue's 
roll is 20, go to 274. If you defeat the statue , 
go to 268. 

Dwarf: AC 3; HD 6*; hp 35; MV 120'(40'); 
#AT 1 fist; D 2-8; ML 12; AL N 


272. Recalling the words of the watery spirit 
in the Crystal Caves, you shout, "Chalci 


dar!" The statue stops and stares at you, the 
smile vanishing from its face. Go to entry 
268. 

273. With a brutal blow, you knock the 
statue over. You can run from the hall and out 
the exit of your choice while the statue recov 
ers. If you wish to flee, exit to the west (74), 
north (281), east (366), or south (306). If, 
however, you wish to continue fighting the 
statue, return to entry 271 and finish the 
fight. You automatically gain the initiative in 
the coming rounds. If you flee, you have not 
defeated the statue. He will be awaiting your 
re turn. If you try to recross the hall, you will 
have to dodge again. 

274. As you aim a blow at the statue's neck it 
reaches up and catches your weapon in its 
hand. If your weapon is magical, go to entry 

275. Otherwise, go to 276. 

275. Your arm goes numb from the shock of 
the blow, but you recover quickly. The statue 
will, however, automatically gain the initia 
tive in the coming rounds. Return to 271 and 
finish the battle. 

276. Your weapon shatters and your arm 
goes numb. A silent voice in your head sug 
gests that it may be time to retreat. Unless 
you have an extra weapon, you must fight 
with your bare fists until you find one. When 
striking, you will do 1 point of damage plus 
any Strength Bonus. Return to 271 and fin 
ish the fight. 

277. You walk slowly around the pillar. On 
the eastern side you notice a small set of 
handholds. Ifyou wish, you can climb the pil 
lar (278). Otherwise, you can exit the hall to 
the west (74), north (281), east (366) or south 
(306). 

278. You lay down your shield and weapon 
and begin climbing the spire. As you climb, 
you can feel the light of Heir's Stone burning 
brighter and brighter. You feel the essence of 
earth and stone, the purity of gems, the spe 
cial fire of precious metals. You feel and sense 
the reality of Paradise all around you, some 
thing that transcends your surroundings. 
Finally, you reach the top and look into Heir's 
Stone. Its inner fires possess a depth you can 
only guess at. IfN is crossed off your Event 
Record, go immediately to entry 280. Other 
wise, you can touch Heir's Stone (279), or 
climb back down and exit to the west (74), 
north (281), east (366), or south (306). 

279. You tentatively reach out your hand, 
then yank it back as your fingers encounter 
an aura of icy fire. But something pulls at 


22 



you, and you reach out again. Your hand 
does not encounter a hard jewel-it passes 
through the stone and into its heart. You are 
hit with a sudden surge of energy, and black 
out. In the blackness, a light burns. Runes 
float before your mind's eye. To read them, 
see Inscription 7. The light grows. The Great 
Hall around you is swept with a purifying fire 
that leaps from the Heir's Stone and wipes 
away every vestige offyrsnaca's wrath. It is a 
holy fire that is the exact opposite of the 
fyrsnaca's lustful flame. The pestilence is 
purged and all is clean again. 

As this mental fire dies away, you awake to 
find the hall as it was before; But you are 
lying at the base of the pillar, healed of 2-12 
points of damage. Cross N off your Event 
Record. You may exit the hall to the west 
(74), north (281), east (366), or south (306). 


280. You find that you can go no further. 
Something holds you back. You have much to 
accomplish before reencountering Heir's 
Stone. You climb back down and exit to the 
west (74), north (281), east (366), or south 
(306). 

281 

This hallway has been blasted 
with fire. Cinders cling to the 
walls. Even the rock is cracked, 
especially at the southern end of 
the hall. The southmost door on 
the east has been completely 
burned away. The other two 
eastern doors are charred but 
solid. The northern door 
appears to be made of a dark 
metal. You can pass through the 
northern door (282). the middle 
eastern door (294), the south- 
most eastern doorway (296), or 
the southern doorway (265). 



282 



The metal door fits snugly in its frame, but 
opens easily when pushed. Inside is a library. 
The walls are covered with shelves holding 
damp scrolls. There are several soggy, decayed 
chairs. The floor is wet. Your ring outlines a 
secret door on the eastern wall. If you wish to 
investigate this room further, go to entry 283. 
Otherwise, return to the hall (281). 


283. You take a scroll down from the shelf near 
est the door. It crumbles in your hand, leaving 
nothing but the wooden spindle. All these writ 


ings are decayed beyond repair unless there is 
some magical means to restore them. The water 
in the room is responsible for the mold and 
decay. You look around and see that a crack has 
opened in the ceiling that lets water in from out 
side. Then you notice several restless, black 
shapes hanging from the ceiling. You can 
retreat to the hall (281) or try quietly crossing 
over to the secret door (284). 

284. You tiptoe toward the secret door, trying 
to maintain your footing on the slimy floor. 
Roll Id20. If the number is greater than your 
Dexterity, go to 286. Otherwise, go to 287. 

285. You shake your head, making sure no 
bats are stuck in your hair. You proceed to the 
secret door. Go to 289. 

286. You slip slightly and fall against a scroll 
rack, sending several scrolls tumbling noisily 

s to the floor. The bats hanging from the ceiling 
descend in a black cloud. Most of them 
swarm out the fissure in the ceiling, but two 
dive and attack you. If you roll a 20, go to 
288. If you win, go to 285. 

Giant bats: AC 6; HD 2; hp 13,9; 
MV 180'(60');#AT 1 bite; D 1-4; ML 8; 
AL N 

287. You skirt disaster and arrive at the secret 
door. The bats on the ceiling remain undis 
turbed. Go to 289. 

288. With a quick whack, you smack a bat 
across the room and into the wall. It drops 
into the water and lies still. Return to 286 
and finish the fight. 

289 


This metal door creaks back on its rusty 
hinges. Inside are more, better-preserved 
scrolls. Yet here too, the dampness has seeped 
in and some of the scrolls are moldy. If you 
wish to investigate further, go to 290. Other 
wise, return to the hall (281). 

290. You walk in and put your hand on a 
scroll, ready to take it down from the shelf. 
Suddenly, you realize that this is no normal 
mold. It is yellow mold. You dare not move; 
you hardly dare breathe. Roll Id20. Ifthe roll 
is greater than your Dexterity, go to 293. 
Otherwise, go to 291. 

291. Carefully, you back toward the door, 
placing your feet in the same spots you 
stepped coming into the room. Finally you 
find yourself back in the damp library. Go to 

292. 

23 



292. You discover you still have the scroll you 
picked up in the yellow mold room! Fortu 
nately. it is not contaminated. You risk strik 
ing a light to read by. The few bats on the 
ceiling fly back up the fissure. Most of the 
scroll is too badly damaged to read, but you 
can make out the end section wrapped closest 
to the spool. To read the scroll, see Inscription 
8. Return to the hall (281). 

293. You gingerly lower your hand to your 
side. Slowly, you move toward the door. But 
as you do, your back hits a shelf. The yellow 
mold spores explode. You instantly take 1-6 
points of damage and leap out the door before 
the spores engulf you completely. You must 
make a Saving Throw vs. Poison. If you fail, 
take another 2-12 points of damage. If you 
survive, go to 292. 

294. You push on this door, but it is locked. If 
G is crossed off your Event Record, go to 

295. Otherwise, return to the hall (281) and 
try another door. 

295 


You take out old Maudin's keys. One of the 
keys of dwarf-make unlocks the door. It 
swings open. Inside is a room that does not 
look much different than it did many years 
ago. It is decorated in green. A sitting and 
sleeping area share the space. You search for 
any clues but find nothing. There does not 
seem to have been anyone living here. 
Return to the hall (281). 

296 


You peer around the charred doorframe 
into this room. It was mostly consumed by 
fire. You notice some strange holes. It looks as 
if the rock itself has been burned away in 
spots. You can investigate further (297) or 
return to the hall (281). 

297. The room was once a bedchamber. The 
floor is laced with holes. As you bend closer to 
examine one, a peculiar scent wafts out of it. 
Suddenly, the stench is overwhelming. Four 
red, pulsating bloated worms erupt out of the 
holes and attack. If you are bitten, go to 302. 
If you roll a 20, go to 299. If you kill two 
worms, go to 300. If a worm's roll is 20, go to 
301. If you win, go to 298. 

Red worms: AC 7; HD 2 + 2*; hp 7,12,15,9; 
MV 90'(30'); #AT 1 bite; D 1-4 + poi 
son; ML 9; AL C 






298. You quickly kick the ugly carcasses back 
down the holes. You hear other worms below 
so you had better hurry! While you were 
fighting, you spotted a small metal box, only 
partially melted by the intense heat of the 
fyrsnaca fire. You grab it and run back into 
the hall. You struggle to open the box, but the 
lock is melted. In frustration, you stamp on it 
with your iron-shod boot, breaking the 
hinge. Inside is a document covered with 
runes. Most is ruined by fire and rust, but the 
first part is legible. It is a dwarf summary of a 
document's contents. Unfortunately, the rest 
of the document is illegible. To read it, see 
Inscription 9. Go to 281. 

299. With a sudden rage, you whirl in a 
frenzy, raining blows on the worms. They fall 
back momentarily before the onslaught. Each 
worm takes 1-4 additional points of damage. 
You can flee back to the hall while they are 
stunned (281). Otherwise, return to 297 and 
finish the fight. 

300. With a crushing overhead blow, you 
slam one of the worms back down its hole. 
Roll 2d6. If the number is greater than 9, go 
to 303. Otherwise, return to 297 and finish 
the fight. 

301. IfXB is crossed off your Event Record, 
go to 304. One of the worms swallows your 
foot. Only your heavy boot protects you from 
severe damage. The worm quickly backs 
down a hole, dragging you with it. As your 
leg disappears underground, you grab hold 
of the top of the hole and pull back. Your foot 
pops out of the boot. With one foot bare, you 
leap to your feet to confront the worms. Cross 
XB off your Event Record. Return to 297 
and finish the fight. 

302. Hundreds of the worm's tiny razor-like 
teeth rasp against your leg. You feel a burning 
sensation. You must make a Saving Throw 
vs. Poison. If you fail, take double damage. 
You must Save vs. Poison each time you are 
bitten, or suffer double damage. If you sur 
vive, return to 297 and finish the battle. 

303. Each of the remaining worms disap 
pears down into the pit. Go to 298. 

304. If XC is crossed of your Event Record, 
go to 305. Another worm engulfs your 
remaining boot, dragging you closer to the 
other's gaping jaws. You frantically kick the 
second boot loose. Return to 297. 

305. No boot protects you this time as the 
razor-teeth lance into the flesh of your leg. 
Take Id6 points of damage and make a Sav 
ing Throw vs. Poison. If you make your save 


and survive the damage, return to 297 and 
finish the fight. Otherwise, your character 
has just fallen into a paralyzed stupor and the 
worms drag him into their lair, never to be 
seen again. Start a new character. 



This once-handsome hall was covered by 
carvings and mosaics. They are now cracked 
and broken. The door on the north is blasted 
off its hinges. A portion of the western wall 
has collapsed into a gaping pit. Foul vapors 
waft up out of it. On the south is a beautiful 
door of mithril covered with gents in the 
design of a forge surmounted by a five- 
starred crown. You may pass through the 
copper door on the west (307), the silver door 
on the southeast (323), the brass door on the 
northeast (312), the mithril door on the south 
(336), through the gaping hole in the western 
wall (364), or through the doorway on the 
north (265). 


307 



The copper-plated door is green with age 
and scorched by fire. It swings back slowly on 
stiffhinges. This dwarfhome is now decayed, 
its furnishings covered by mold. You look 
around and notice that there are pitchers, 
empty phials, sealedjars. You open one ofthe 
sealed jars. Inside are a dozen dried bat 
wings. You may leave (306) or open the door 
on the west (308). 


308 



This bedchamber is as moldy as the outer 
room. Dust lies thickly everywhere. The 
walls are covered with shelves holding 
strange objects-skulls, and skeletons of 
small animals. A cache of phials catches your 
eye. You examine them and see that all but 
three have deteriorated into powder. You may 
sip the red (309), green (310), or purple 
(311) liquid, or leave (306). 


309. This liquid is so sweet that you almost 
spit it out, but you feel a vigor coursing 
through you. You heal two points of damage. 


This is a potion of healing. Return to 308 and 
make another choice. 

310. This bitter liquid burns your throat. 
You take two points of damage. Make a Sav 
ing Throw vs. Poison. If you fail, you take an 
additional 2-8 points of damage. If you save, 
you take 1-4 points of damage. If you sur 
vive, return to 308 and choose again. 

311. This flavorless liquid suddenly gives 
you a keen sense of memory and reason. It is 
a potion of mind control. If you drink it 
before fighting vapor ghouls, they are not 
able to drain your Intelligence. Return to 
308 and make another choice. 



The blackened brass-plated door is parti 
ally open. You peer in and see that a large 
part of this room was consumed by fire. It is 
in ruin and there is nothing ofvalue. You may 
leave (306) or open the door on the east 
(313). 

313. As you cross the room, two dark 
shadows rise out of the ashes. You may flee 
back to the hall before they reach you (306), 
or you can stay and fight. If you do not have a 
magic weapon, you must flee. If you are hit, 
go to 314. If you roll a 17 or higher, go to 315. 
If you win, go to 316. If you lose, go to 317. 

Shadows: AC 7; HD 2 + 2; hp 15,10; 
MV 90'(30');#AT 1 touch; D 1-4 + spe 
cial; ML 12; AL C 

314. One ofthe Shadow's amorphous hands 
passes into your chest. You feel a cold hand 
take hold of your heart. Take 1-4 points of 
damage, and reduce your Strength by 1 
point. If your Strength falls to 0, go to 317. 
Otherwise, return to 313 and finish the bat 
tle. Remember, you lose a Strength point 
each time you are hit. 

315. You strike out. The heat of your passion 
causes your blow to do double damage to the 
cold creature. Return to 313 and finish the 
battle. 

316. With a final blow, the dark form dis 
solves into the blackness of the underworld. 
You go to the eastern door (318). 

317. You feel your body lighten and thin. 
Your armor and clothing fall to the floor. You 
are now a shadow and will remain here to 
haunt this room. You have lost this character, 
and must choose a new one. 


24 









318 


0 

You stagger through the eastern door. This 
bedchamber seems to have been protected from 
the moisture that has ruined much of Thunder- 
delve. You find a golden armband (worth 50 
gp). If you wish to rest, you can lay down on the 
fine bed (319), or you can leave (306). 

319. If MM is crossed off your Event 
Record, go to 320. You close the door and 
wedge it shut, then stretch out on the silken 
sheets. Quickly, you fall into a sound sleep. In 
a dream, you see a large underground pool. 
The surrounding cave is carved in the relief 
of many pillars. Each pillar is capped by a 
five-starred crown. As you watch, the stars 
on the crowns begin to glow brighter and 
brighter, bathing the room in their red light, 
making the bubbling pool look like lava. 
Then suddenly, out of the pool erupts a great 
face. It turns toward you and opens its wide 
mouth. You cannot move and are swallowed 
into its crimson interior. You awake sweating. 
Even though your dream was disturbing, you 
feel rested. You have been healed of 1-4 
points of damage, and 1-4 points of Strength 
are restored (if you lost any). You can feel 
intuitively, that you should not return to this 
room. Cross MM off your Event Record, 
and return to 306. 

320. You stretch out, ready for another 
restoring rest. Suddenly, the sheets fly up 
around you, trapping you in the bed. Roll 
ld20. If the number is greater than your 
Strength, go to 321. Otherwise, go to 322. 

321. You struggle desperately against the 
smothering power of the sheets. You feel as if 
a great hand is clamped over your mouth. 
Take 3-18 points of damage. If you survive, 
goto 322. 


but worth 250 gp. You may exit through the 
northeastern door (324), through the southeast 
ern door (335), or leave (306). 



This room was used as a bedchamber. The 
linens and cloths have all rotted away. Beside 
the bed is a wooden chest. The front has bro 
ken away. You can examine it (325) or leave 
(323). 

325. The chest conceals a small stone vault. 
Carved on the stone are runes. If you wish to 
read them, see Inscription 10. The four cor 
ners and center of each side of this small vault 
have gems embedded in them, one in each of 
the six spots: amethyst, diamond, emerald, 
ruby, sapphire, and topaz. Perhaps the runic 
message is connected with the gems and 
offers a clue as to how the vault might be 
opened. If you wish to try and open the vault, 
go to 326. Otherwise, return to the outer 
chamber (323). 

326. After studying the passage, decide 
which of the following combinations is the 
order in which you press the stones:

327. The vault clicks open! Inside is a black 
bag with gems (worth a total of 100 gp), a sil 
ver mesh bag (worth 1,500 sp) that holds a 
ruby ring (worth 1,000 gp), a platinum head- 
band (worth 1,500 gp), and three gold ingots 
(worth a total of 1,200 gp). You can try on the 
ring (332) or the headband (333), or return 
to the outer chamber (323). 


322. You feel a great weight bearing down on 
your chest. With a final burst of strength, you 
tear through the sheets and flee back to the 
hall (306)." 


32 3 



This tarnished silver door bears evidence of 
intense heat and fire. Inside is a ruined dwarf 
home. There are many elegant dishes and crys 
tal glasses, all too delicate to move by yourself. 


328. You hear a click and look up as a section 
of the ceiling opens. A green slime falls on 
your left shoulder. The smell of corroding 
metal fills your nostrils. Calmly, with the 
experience of many years, you kneel and 
make a fire. As you do so, the slime spreads 
down across your armor. It will take time for 
it to eat through the armor to your skin. You 
must first get the fire started properly. 
Finally, the fuel ignites, and you quickly burn 
the slime off your armor. You take 1-6 points 
of damage. If you survive, go to 334. 

329. You hear something smash. The room 
fills with an almond-scented blue smoke. 
Make a Saving Throw vs. Poison. If you fail. 


take 5-30 points of damage. If you save, take 
2-12 points of damage. If you survive, you 
must flee to the outer chamber (323). You can 
try to open the vault again after you give the 
gas in the room time to dissipate. 

330. A lightning bolt arcs from the vault to 
your body. The stench of burning ozone fills 
your lungs. Make a Saving Throw vs. Spells. 
If you fail, take 6-36 points of damage. If you 
save, take 3-18 points of damage. If you sur 
vive, you may try again to open the vaull 
(326) or return to the outer chamber (323). 

331. You wait, but nothing happens. You can 
try again to open the vault (326) or return to 
the outer chamber (323). 

332. You slip the ring on your finger. Your 
pulse quickens; you feel a surge of renewal. 
This is a ring of regeneration. You may try on 
the headband (333) or return to the outer 
chamber (323). 

333. There is no effect from wearing this beau 
tiful piece ofjewelry. You may try on the ring 
(332) or return to the outer chamber (323). 

334. Your armor hangs in patches. You must 
take the remnants off. If you have a shield, 
your AC is 8. If not, your AC is 9. You can try 
to open the vault again (326) or return to the 
outer chamber (323). 

335 


This room is a pitiful sight. It was a dwarf 
nursery. Toys are spilled across the floor, left 
where they were when the fyrsnaca struck. 
You close the door. As you pull it shut, it 
knocks a spinning top out in front of you. If 
you wish to take it, cross P off your Event 
Record. Return to the outer chamber (323). 

336 _ 




This beautiful hall is completely undam 
aged. The walls are covered with ornate carv 
ings fitted with gold and silver wire, studded 
with gems of every type. The scene is that of a 
landscape. The northwestern door is open 
and thick vapors waft out through the door 
way. All the other doors are shut. The one on 
the south bears the sign of a forge sur- 



26 




mounted by a five-starred crown. You may 
exit to the north (306) or south (354), 
through the western door (337), the north 
east door (346), or the southeast door (347). 

337 



At least half of this room has been swal 
lowed into the huge pit. The vapors are 
extremely thick. On the north you see a 
smashed table and chair. Shelves full of 
charred scrolls stand against the eastern wall. 
Some of these have been pulled down. Your 
ring outlines a small secret compartment in 
the middle of the northern wall. If you wish, 
you can examine it (338). Otherwise, return 
to the hall (336). 

338. As you go to the little door, the vapors 
coalesce around you. You shake your head in 
disbelief and ready yourself. Three vapor 
ghouls attack. If you have no magical 
weapon, go to 342. If you are hit, go to 340. 
If you roll a 20, go to 341. If you are reduced 
to 8 or less hit points, go to 343. If you win, 
go to 339. 

Vapor ghouls: AC 2; HD 3*; hp 16,10,8; 
Mv"l60'(40'); #AT 1 touch; D 1-4 + 
special; ML 9; AL C 

339. You try to concentrate. You watch as the 
vapor ghouls dissolve back into the pit, then 
turn your attention to the secret compart 
ment. It was originally locked, but the stone 
lock was shattered during the fyrsnaca's 
onslaught. The door opens easily. Go to 344. 

340. The vapor ghoul's arms lengthen, reach 
past your defenses, and grasp your head. You 
feel a shock. Take 1-4 points of damage, and 
lose 1 point of Intelligence. If your Intelligence 
falls to 0, you are defeated. If you survive, 
return to 338 and finish the fight. You lose one 
point of Intelligence each time you are hit. 

341. During the fight you noticed the stone 
lock on the secret compartment was shattered 
during the fyrsnaca's assault. Now, if you 
could only maneuver the vapor ghouls away, 
open the compartment, grab the treasure, 
and run! With your back to the compart 
ment, you shout savagely. The ghouls fall 
back. You throw open the door, grab the 
pouch inside, and run out into the hall before 
the vapor ghouls can recover. Go to 344. 


342. You fall back in terror. Only magical 
weapons can hit them. You throw them your 
most valuable treasure, and run. They do not 
follow, but will await you should you return. 
If you later return and defeat the vapor 
ghouls, your treasure will not be here. They 
will have taken it into the pit. Cross your 
most valuable treasure off your Equipment 
List and go to 336. 

343. You feel weak and drained. "What do 
you want?" you ask the vapor ghouls. With 
one voice, they answer, "Our treasures." You 
can give them half the treasures you have 
found since entering Thunderdelve (345), or 
return to 338 and finish the fight. 

344. Inside a pouch are two rings identical to 
the one Niniron gave you (each is worth 500 
gp). There is also a phial labelled in Nimron's 
shaky hand. To read the label, see Inscription 
11. The pouch also contains a silver key. 
Cross V off your Event Record and go to 
336. 

345. You give them half of the treasures you 
found, laying them on the floor. The vapor 
ghouls quickly float to the spot and hover 
over it. You flee to the hall, aware that the 
ghouls will be waiting for you should you 
return to this room. If you later return and 
defeat the vapor ghouls, your treasures will 
not be here. They will have been taken into 
the pit. Go to 336. 

346 



This ancient sitting room is now a mauso 
leum. Dwarf skeletons lie across the room. 
You go to a table and take a decayed book 
from a skeleton's hand. All the pages have 
rotted away, but runes written on the inside of 
the back cover are still legible. To read them, 
see Inscription 12. You carefully tuck this 
book into your pack for Grona. Cross Q, off 
your Event Record and return to the hall 
(336). 

347 



You open the door and find the delights of 
dwarf toy making you have not seen since you 
were young! The floor is littered with metal 
warriors, gemballs, mechanical dragonettes, 
and whizbangs. If you wish to investigate, go 


to 348. Otherwise, you can exit to the west 
(336) or south (354). 

348. You proceed to the toy shelves. But then 
you hear a peculiar whirring sound. You turn 
and see the entire army of 24 metal warriors 
marching toward you, their little razor-sharp 
axes raised, their little crossbows loaded. 
Nimron must have made these to guard his 
children from danger. If P is crossed off your 
Event Record, go to 349. The toy soldiers 
attack in deadly unison. Treat them as a sin 
gle living statue for combat purposes. If you 
roll a 20, go to 350. If your hit points fall to 8 
or less, go to 351. If the soldiers' roll is a 20, 
go to 352. If you win, go to 353. 

Toy soldiers: AC 3; HD 3; hp 24; 

MV60'(20');#AT 1 axe/1 bow; D 1-4/1-3; 

ML 12; ALN 

349. You reach into your pack and pull out 
the spinning top you found earlier. You give it 
a quick twist and set it spinning among the 
toy warriors. The top distracts them, flips 
them over, and knocks them high into the air. 
It does not hurt them, but you will be able to 
attack twice each round because of their dis 
traction. Return to 348 and conduct the com 
bat. 

350. With a broad sweep, you knock several 
tin warriors into a pile in the corner. You pull 
a shelf down on top of them, trapping them 
underneath and causing doing an additional 
1-8 points of damage. Return to 348 and fin 
ish the combat. 

351. The remaining soldiers rush you, chop 
ping furiously at your feet. You step back, 
stumble, and fall. Instantly you are sur 
mounted by the soldiers who rush about your 
chest. Several archers position themselves 
below your throat, crossbows aimed up your 
nostrils. You dare not move. But suddenly, 
you sneeze. The heave of your chest and the 
force of your breath tosses the little warriors 
into the air. Quickly, while they recover, you 
crawl out the door and into the hall. Go to 
336. 

352. Several little men grab a jumping rope 
and rush at your feet. The rope trips you and 
you fall to the ground, taking another 1-4 
hits. Several soldiers begin climbing your 
back, but youjump up, knocking them to the 
floor. The archers take aim and fire. Return 
to 348 and finish the combat. 

353. If you wish to take one of the broken 
warriors as a souvenir, cross R off your Event 
Record. You can exit to the east (336) or the 
south (354). 


27 





354 



This room is so elegant, it must have been 
Nimron's and his wife's private chamber. You 
look around for any clues but find none. 
There are no valuables. Your ring outlines a 
secret door on the west. You can exit through 
the secret door (355), the eastern door (361), 
the middle door on the north (336), or the 
northeast door (347). 

355. You swing back the door and see a set of 
stairs leading up. If you wish to explore it, go 
to 356. Otherwise, return to 354 and make 
another choice. 



356. You climb the stairs a short distance, 
then find that they have been smashed into 
rubble. You can look through a gap in the 
northern wall, into the pit, and smell the 
vapors. As you start back down, you feel 
something entwine itself around your feet. 
You look down and see a huge snake. If you 
are bitten, go to 358. If you roll a 20, go to 
359. If the snake's roll is a 20, go to 360. If 
you win, go to 357. 

(Roll only to see if the bite hits. Do not roll for 
the squeeze.) 

Rock python: AC 6; HD5*; hp 25; 

MV 90'(30'); #AT 1 bite/1 squeeze; 
D 1-4/2-8; ML 8; AL N 

357. With a final heave, you rip the snake 
from around your body and fling its writhing 
form out into the pit. You sit on the broken 
stairs to rest momentarily. Your hand falls on 
something lying on the stairs. It is a locket. 
Inside is a picture of a dwarven lady, perhaps 
Nimron's wife. If you take it, cross S off your 
Event Record. Return downstairs to 354. 

358. As the snake bites you, its tail coils 
around you and squeezes, causing an extra 2- 
8 points of damage. Every time you are bit 
ten, the snake automatically squeezes you for 
another 2-8 points of damage. Return to 356 
and finish the battle. 

359. You grab hold of the snake's tail and 
whip it into a wall. It falls, momentarily 
stunned. You can retreat downstairs (354) or 


you can return to 356 and finish the fight. If 
you continue to fight, you receive automatic 
initiative in the coming rounds. 

360. The snake's coils find their way around 
your throat and begin to squeeze. You cannot 
breathe, but continue to fight. Return to 356 
and finish the combat. You automatically lose 
the initiative in coming rounds. 

361 



This door opens onto a short, damp corri 
dor carved out of the rough stone. It leads 
into a cavern filled with decayed plants and 
fungus. The floor is thick with loam and 
debris. If you wish, you can investigate (362) 
or leave (354). 

362. You begin to push your way through the 
plant debris, when suddenly your foot kicks 
against a giant mushroom. It lets out a shriek 
that lasts for several minutes. Something is 
bound to answer this call. You can retreat 
from the garden (354) or continue your 
search (363). 

363. You search warily for several minutes, 
but nothing comes. You search and discover 
the skeleton of a dwarf lady. Next to it lies a 
small, empty blue phial. On the skeleton's 
skull is a five-starred tiara of gold, emerald, 
and sapphire (worth 3,000 gp). If you take it, 
cross T off your Event Record. Return to 
354. 

364 


All but the northeast corner of this room 
has fallen into the pit. You carefully move 
along the narrow remains of the floor. The 
stone is cracked and burnt. The broken stone 
has formed a narrow bridge that spans the 
chasm and leads he west. The raw stone of 
this accidental bridge disappears into the 
gloom beyond. Thick vapors float below it, 
filling the air with their noxious smell. There 
is nothing else to see in this broken room. You 
may exit to the east (306) or cross the bridge 
(365). 



365 



You proceed slowly, testing each step 
before placing your full weight on the spot. 
The fyrsnaca obviously struck above and 
below this patch of stone, accidentally creat 
ing the bridge. Perhaps more than casual fate 
had a hand in the stone's preservation. A 
loose stone slips from under foot, and you 
stumble, falling to your hands and knees. 
With single-minded intent, you crawl slowly 
toward the bridge's end. You can crawl west 
(240) or east (364). 

366 


These wide stairs of clear crystal are 
chipped and cracked, stained by smoke and 
fire. Numerous skeletons lie piled against the 
walls. At the bottom of the stairs are huge 
doors, identical to those west of the Great 
Hall. Except for the stains of smoke, they are 
undamaged. Intricate patterns of gold and 
silver weave through the ironwood. You push 
on the doors, but they do not move. They are 
locked. IfV is crossed off your Event Record, 
go to 367. Otherwise, you must return to the 
Great Hall and make another choice (265). If 
you have not yet defeated the smiling statue, 
you must confront it again. 

367. You remember the crystal key you took 
from the vault in Nimron's ruined study, and 
pull it from your pack. It fits the lock! The 
doors swing back automatically, as a fanfare 
of magical trumpets blare to life. You cringe 
at the noise and curse Nimron's theatrics. 
Moist air and the smell of clean water rush 
out to greet you. You also detect an increase 
in the temperature. You remember Nimron's 
warning against proceeding into the Crystal 
Pools without the Hammer of Vitroin. You 
can retreat to the Great Hall (265) or forge 
ahead (368). If you return to the Great Hall 
but have not yet defeated the smiling statue, 
you must face it again. 



28 








This crystalline room is blackened by fire. 
This place seems to have been quite cheerful 
at one time. Numerous benches line the 
walls, and intricate tile patterns cover the 
floor. The air is humid and smells of clean 
water. But you detect some other scent subtly 
underlying the atmosphere-a foulness that 
cannot be masked. The southern passage 
seems cooler than the northern one. You can 
exit to the north (369), south (399), or west 
(265), or open the door on the east (370). 



This hallway is simply constructed. To the 
east, you hear a sound like a young woman 
sighing. The hallway to the north is labelled 
by runes. If you wish to read the runes see 
Inscription 13. The air flowing from the 
northern arch is hot and humid. You can 
move through the northern arch (371), or to 
the east (381), or south (368). 


shelves are beard scissors, files, combs, and 
numerous phials. You smell a phial; it reeks 
of stale perfume. You can proceed to the east 
(372) or south (369). 


372 



Before you is a large pool. To the north is a 
cloud of steam. Benches and racks cover the 
floor and walls. You can investigate the steam 
source (373),or the pool (374), or leave 
(369). 

373. Wooden benches here were once 
adorned with cushions, but only damp rags 
remain. Steam vents up through holes in the 
floor or out of holes in the walls. There are 
numerous baskets of trinkets, but nothing of 
value. Roll once for treasure. A sudden chill 
rises out of the steamy heat, and you turn to 
see a vapor ghoul forming out of the steam. If 
you have no magical weapon, go to 375. If 
you are hit, go to 378. If you roll a 20, go to 

376. If you win, go to 377. 


377. You lie on a couch for a moment to reori 
ent yourself. As you stand, you almost knock 
a phial off a table. You uncork the phial and 
sniff. Inside are smelling salts. If you wish to 
keep them, cross W off your Event Record. 
You may investigate the pool (374) or leave 
(369). 

378. The vapor ghoul's arms lengthen, reach 
past your defenses and grasp your head. You 
feel a shock. Take 1-4 points of damage, and 
lose one point of Intelligence. If your Intelli 
gence falls to 0, you are defeated. If you survive, 
return to 373 and finish the fight. You lose one 
point of Intelligence each time you are hit. 

379. The urn splashes into the water, slowly 
fills, then sinks. You wait, but nothing hap 
pens. You can go investigate the steam (373) 
or leave (369). 

380. You kneel down, smell the water cau 
tiously, then drink. It refreshes your parched 
throat but has no other effect. You may throw 
a nearby urn into the water (379) or leave 
(369). 

381 




This musty room is the armory. It contains 
several shields, rusty suits of chainmail, and 
racks of swords, axes, and spears. You may 
take anything and return to the hall (368). 



This hall was once carpeted, but only 
moldy rags remain. From the east, comes 
warm, moist air. The northern hall holds 
shelves, mirrors, and two chairs. On the 


Vapor ghoul: AC 2; HD 3*; hp 18; 
MV 160'(40'); #AP 1 touch; D 1-4 + 
special; ML 9; AL C 

374. The waters are calm and clean. You see 
nothing. You may throw a nearby urn into 
the water (379), drink from the waters (380), 
investigate the steam source (373), or leave 
(369). 

375. You fall back in terror. Only magical 
weapons can hit this creature! You throw the 
vapor ghoul your most valuable treasure and 
run. The ghoul does not follow, but will await 
you should you return. Cross your most valu 
able treasure off your Equipment List and go 
to 369. 

376. With a swift circling of your weapon, 
you slice the vapor apart into smaller clouds. 
The vapor ghoul is not destroyed, but takes 
1-6 additional hits while it tries to reform. 
Return to 373 and finish the combat. 


As you step in, the air chills suddenly. 
Nearly half of this large cavern is filled with a 
calm pool. The air is filled with the sighs of a 
young maiden, but you cannot identify their 
source. You see nothing unusual, but on one 
wall is carved a word. If you wish to read it, 
see Inscription 14. Also carved there is one 
five-starred crown. The stars are made of rub 
The airflow here is from north to south, and 
the northern breeze carries hints of warmth 
and moisture. You may exit to the west (369) 
or southwest (395), or investigate the north 
ern alcove (382), or investigate the pool 
(383). 

382. In the alcove is a low altar covered with 
a carved frieze of waves. It is not of dwarven 
make. Laid across the top is a strip of rotted 
blue velvet and a strange helmet of untar 
nished silver (worth 1,000 gp). If you take the 
helmet, cross U off your Event Record. If you 
wish to wear the helmet, also cross X off your 
Event Record. Return to the room of sighs 
(381). 


29 



383. If XE is crossed of your Event Record, 
go to 394. You take an iron spike from your 
pack and toss it into the pool. As the first rip 
ples lap the shore, the waters begin to boil. 
You hitch your belt tighter and ready your 
weapon. Suddenly, an arc oflightning shoots 
from the ceiling into the water, lighting it up 
with a sort of phosphorescence. The waters 
heave up in front of you, taking the shape of a 
man's head. The eyes of the watery spirit 
open slowly, then turn to gaze coolly at you. If 
O is crossed off your Event Record, go to 
390. IfX is crossed off your Event Record, go 
to 385. Otherwise, go to 384. 

384. The water spirit opens its mouth and 
begins to speak. A gale wind drives you to 
your knees, forcing you to avert your face. 
"Who are you that dares disturb the medita 
tion of Chalcidar?" The creature's eyes bore 
deeply into your being, searching for the 
answer to its question. Roll ld20. If the num 
ber is greater than your Intelligence, go to 
392. Otherwise, go to 386. 

385. The eyes of the watery spirit widen in 
recognition. It bows its huge head slightly 
and says, "It is long since one of the Helm 
sum meditation gladly for your sake. With 
permission, 1 will now enter your mind to 
ease your distress." You may give your per 
mission (389) or withhold it (391). 

386. The water-thing gazes at you angrily. 
"You dare refuse me admittance to your 
mind? You creature of mortality!" Its voice 
rises to a roar and hurricane force winds rush 
from its mouth. You are sent spinning against 
the wall, and take 1-6 points of damage. 
When you sit back up, it is gone. The pool is 
silent. If you survived, you may exit to west 
(369) or the southwest (395), or investigate 
the alcove (382). 

387. The voice of the angry waterhead rises 
to hurricane force, dashing you against the 
wall. Take 1-6 points of. "You dare defy me?" 
it roars. A wall of water rushes at you in the 
form of a giant fist. You must make a Saving 
Throw vs. Breath Weapons or be hit by the 
wave for 1-10 points of damage. If you sur 
vive, you may exit to west (369) or the south 
west (395), or investigate the alcove (382). 

388. You nod your head mutely and march 
forward. Chalcidar rears back and embraces 
you. Lightning strikes again, and Chalcidar 
returns to its usual form of a still pool, sinking 
you down to a water doom. If EE is crossed 
off your Event Record, go to 393. Otherwise, 
you have lost this character and must choose 
a new one. 


389. You feel a questioning inside yourself. 
Chalcidar speaks, "You seek the demise of 
the fyrsnaca and the restoration of the dwarf 
lordlings. As is the bargain of the Helm, I 
must advise you toward your goal, though its 
purpose be grievous to me. Let it be known: 
to assure success, you must find the heart of 
Heir's Arm by speaking my name. And again 
by my name, cast the heart down into the 
fyrsnaca's own belly. I have spoken! Trouble 
me no more until it is time." The watery crea 
ture settles back into the shape of a pool. 
Cross both O and Y off your Event Record. 
You may exit to the southwest (395). 

390. The waterhead frowns. "Why trouble 
me again before the appointed time? Know 
you not that the helm may be used but once a 
fortnight? You have broken the pledge of the 
helm and let my curse be upon your head!" A 
gigantic fist of water rushgs at you before you 
can react, and you take 1-6 points of damage. 
In addition, Chalcidar's curse falls upon you. 
All your hits will be at -2 for the rest of this 
adventure. The force of the water carries you 
into the room beyond, then returns as Chalci 
dar flows back into the form of a still pool. Go 
southwest to 395. 

391. You squirm in your boots and shake 
your head. The watery form squints at you 
and says, "Then, although it be your firm 
right to call me by the bargain of the Helm, 1 
see neither the wisdom or the need of it. I 
leave you to your question. Trouble me not 
till it is time!" The watery creature settles 
back into the shape of a pool. Cross O off 
your Event Record. You may exit to the west 
(369) or the southwest (395). 

392. The watery form throws back its great 
head and shouts, "Do not answer! I know 
your name and purpose. Your goal does not 
suit me. I would gladly remain rid of the 
dwarven horde forever. You however, may 
join me." Roll ld20. If the number is greater 
then your Intelligence, go to 388. Otherwise, 
go to 387. 

393. You quietly accept your fate, but suddenly 
you find that you have reached into your pack 
unconsciously and pulled out the pale, blue 
stone you found in the streambed outside 
Thunderdelve. It begins to glow and you find 
that you can breathe again. Quickly the water 
around you heats up. Soon it will begin to boil. 
You will be boiled alive by your own blue stone! 
And you cannot get rid of it-it sticks in your 
hand. Suddenly, you are thrown up out of the 
pool. You find yourself lying in the cave beside 
the steaming water. The sound of the young 
girl's sighs have turned into crying. You have 
defeated Chalcidar. 


Around your neck you find a necklace with 
an empty setting (worth 1,500 gp) into which 
the blue gem fits perfectly. Cross XE off your 
Event Record. You can now exit to the west 
(369) or the southwest (395). 

394. The empty room stands as before. You 
can now exit to the west (369) or the south 
west (395). 

395 


This small cave holds only a small pool, 
several benches, and an inscription. If you 
wish to read it, see Inscription 15. You see no 
clue as the pool's purpose. The water is 
slightly troubled and quite cool. You may 
drink of it (396), toss something into it (397), 
or exit to the south (398) or north (381). 

396. The water is cold, but there is no effect. 
You may toss something into the pool (397), 
or exit to the north (381) or south (398). 

397. You toss an iron spike into the pool and 
watch it disappear into the troubled waters. 
You wait, but nothing happens. You may 
drink from the pool (396) or exit to the north 
(381) or south (398). 

398 


The smooth crystalline walls of this hall are 
scorched. Several dwarf skeletons lie here. 
The passage to the east smells acrid. The one 
to the west feels cold. You may go north 
(395), south (411), east (414), west (399, or 
southwest (403). 

399 


The hallway leads into a cold crystalline 
cavern. The wall is inscribed with runes. To 
read them, see Inscription 16. In one corner 





30 


is a pool of inky blackness. Your sight does 
not penetrate the surface of these waters, nor 
does anything reflect back. You may drink 
from this pool (400), toss a spike into it (401), 
or exit to the north (368) or east (398). 

400. You kneel and reach into the icy black 
ness. It looks as if your hand has disappeared 
as you can see noting below the surface. The 
wafer is intensely cold, almost too cold to 
touch. You bring up a handful of water. It is 
so dark, it looks like a hole in the center of 
your hand. You may drink it (402), or you 
may exit to the north (368) or east (398), or 
you can throw a spike into the pool (405). 

401. You throw a spike into the pool. Steam 
rises into the air front the spot where it disap 
peared into the water. There are no ripples. 
You wait, but nothing happens. You can 
drink from the pool (400), or exit to the north 
(369) or east (398). 

402. You sip the water and gag instantly. You 
must make a Saving Throw vs. Poison, with a - 
4 modifier. If you fail, take 3-30 points of dam 
age. If you save, take 2-12 points of damage. If 
you survive, you can toss a spike into the pool 
(401) or exit to the north (368) or east (398). 

403 


The west half of this crystalline cavern is 
filled with another pool and benches. Above 
the pool is an inscription. To read it, see 
Inscription 17. You may exit to the northeast 
(398) or southeast (411). drink from the pool 

(404) , or toss an iron spike into it (405). 

404. You sit on the bench and scoop up some 
water. You sip it and feel reenergized. If you 
have lost any Strength or Intelligence during 
your adventure, both are fully restored. You 
rise refreshed. If you were controlled by the 
Hammer of Vitroin, go to 406. Otherwise, 
you may throw an iron spike into the pool 

(405) or exit to the northeast (398) or south 
east (411). 

405. The spike plops into the water. Nothing 
happens, but suddenly from somewhere to 
the north you hear the sound of churning 
water, followed by silence. You may drink 
from this pool (404) or exit to the northeast 
(398) or southeast (411). 



Check. One of you will gain mastery over the 
other. And your Intelligence and Wisdom 
scores. This is your Will. Ifyou are wounded, 
roll ld8 and subtract 1-8 points from your 
Will. If your Will is then greater than 14, go 
to 407. Otherwise, go to 408. 

407. With a wrench you take control of the 
hammer. "We must find the fyrsnaca," it 
whispers. But you are free of the power of its 
voice. Do you continue your quest for the 
fyrsnaca (409), or will you honor your bar 
gain with Nimron and return to him (410)? 

408. Your will melts. You will never be free of 
the power of the hammer from Thunder- 
delve. The hammer has taken complete con 
trol of you. There is no second chance to free 
yourself. You can use no other weapon, and 
you cannot leave Thunderdelve until the 
fyrsnaca is destroyed. If this character is 
slain, your next character will be under the 
same prohibition. You must exit this room to 
the northeast (398) or southest (411). 

409. "The urgency of our quest for the 
fyrsnaca surpasses all other needs and hon 
ors," whispers the hammer. You feel compel 
led to lock into your thought. You have 
unwittingly resurrendered to the hammer's 
will. The hammer has taken complete control 
of you. There is no second chance to free 
yourself. You can use no other weapon, and 
you cannot leave Thunderdelve until the 
fyrsnaca is destroyed. If this character is 
slain, your next character will be under the 
same prohibition. You can now exit to the 
northeast (398) or the southeast (411). 

410. "No." cries the hammer. "You shall not 
take me back only to cure a clumsy dwarf, 
Keeper or no!" With a laugh, you turn and 
start toward the front gates, carrying the pro 
testing hammer with you. Go to Section S3. 



Several beds are built into the walls of this 
crystalline cavern. A pool fills the southeast cor 
ner. Over it is carved a rune. To read it, see 
Inscription 18. A ladle sits on a small golden 
stand beside the pool. You may drink from the 
pool (412), toss the ladle into it (413), or exit to 
the north (398) or west (403). 


406. Suddenly, you remember that the ham- 412. You reach down and take the ladle in 
mer has control of you. You fight back with hand, filling it with water. You drink deeply, 

your renewed vigor. Make a new Control Instantly, you feel compelled to lie down on 


one of the beds, and do so. Scenes of your life- 
flash before your eyes, but then the visions 
turn nightmarish. Hordes of monsters leap at 
you, and smother you. Gradually your mem 
ories clear. You feel that you have just relived 
most of your life, although only minutes have 
passed. Ifyou have lost any experience levels 
fighting undead, one level is restored. No 
more than one level can be restored unless 
you lose more levels in a new fight with the 
undead. Then one more may be restored. 
You may toss the ladle into the pool (413) or 
exit to the north (398) or west (403). 

413. The ladle splashes into the water, then 
quickly floats back up to the top. You wait a 
moment, but nothing happens. The ladle 
floats over to where you stand. Ifyou haven't 
done so yet, you can drink from it (412) or 
exit to the north (398) or south (403). 

414 


You move into this large cavern mostly 
filled by a pool. Over it are carved many 
runes. To read them, see Inscription 19. The- 
air is warmer here than in the hallway. The 
walls are carved into the shape of pillars 
capped by five-starred crowns set with real 
gems. They are out of your reach. Numerous 
benches line the walls. You may drink from 
the pool (415), toss an iron spike into it (416), 
or leave (398). 

415. You kneel and sip the warm water. It is 
brackish and unpleasant. You spit it out and 
suffer no ill effects. You may toss an iron spike 
into the pool (416) or leave (398). 

416. You take a spike out of your pack and 
toss it into the pool. It vanishes into the 
depths. You wait a moment, but nothing hap 
pens. Go to 420. 

417. You must act quickly and fight well, for 
more than your life hangs in the balance. You 
have awakened the fyrsnaca. If it destroys 
you, it will rise to destroy the countryside, 
and nothing will stop it. You step back out of 
the fyrsnaca's range, prepare momentarily, 
then rush forward to your doom. You cannot 



31 



retreat. Ifyou roll an 18, 19. or 20, go to 421. 
If the fyrsnaca's roll is a 20, go to 422. If the 
fyrsnaca's hit points fall below 25, go to 423. 
If its hit points fall below 10, go to 424. Ifyou 
are reduced to 10 or less hits, go to 425. Ifyou 
win, go to 430. 

Fyrsnaca: AC 5; HD 10*; hp 70; 
MV 60'(20'); #AT: 1 bite or 1 breath; D 
1-8 or 2-12; ML 12; AL C 


There is a 1/3 chance the fyrsnaca will 
breathe fire each round. 

418. Recalling the words of Chalcidar, you 
quickly pull out the huge ruby heart of Heir's 
Arm. But did Chalcidar tell you the truth? 
Suddenly, the fyrsnaca's head lunges for 
ward, missing you but crushing the stone 
wall at your side. You must act immediately! 
Ifyou decide to trust Chalcidar, go to 419. If 
you decide to trust your own prowess and 
weaponry, go to 417. 

419. The gaping throat and sharp teeth of the 
fyrsnaca loom over you. "Chalcidar!" you 
shout as you hurl the great ruby at the fire- 
snake's maw. Roll ld20. If the number is 
greater than your Dexterity, go to 426. Oth 
erwise, go to 427. 

420. You wipe the sweat from your brow as 
you notice that the room is growing much 
hotter. The water at your feet begins to boil 
and glow red. Steam rises from it. The pool 
explodes in a geyser of steam, water, and fire. 
A huge mouth atop a long, bloated body 
shoots into the air, then lands half on rock, 
half in water. Its evil eyes turn and fasten on 
you. Its huge mouth opens. Heat pours out. 
The room wavers in the steam. A red-hot 
throat and heart lie behind those cruel teeth. 
The fyrsnaca lunges toward you, chewing 
through the rock at your feet, ready to swal 
low you in one bite. If both M and Y are 
crossed off your Event Record, go to 418. 
Otherwise, go to 417. 

421. The foul serpent lunges at you. At the 
last second, you leap aside, striking at the 
huge eye beside you. The beast roars in pain, 
biting at the ceiling, raining rock down into 
the pool. You take advantage of its confusion 
and strike a hearty blow at its chest, causing 
an additional 1-8 points of damage. The 
fyrsnaca breathes fire, filling the room with 
the red light of its agony. The fyrsnaca is con 
fused, and you automatically gain the initia 
tive in the following rounds. Return to 417 
and finish the battle. 


422. Thousands of fiery teeth snap at you. 
You dodge, but the skirt of your chainmail is 
caught. The fyrsnaca lifts you high into the 
air, trying to toss you down into its throat. 
You hack wildly at its mouth, snapping off 
needle-like teeth. It roars in pain and drops 
you. blasting fire as you fall. Your hair badly 
is singed as you hit the rock floor forcing the 
air from your lungs. Badly bruised, you rise 
just in time tojump aside as another spear of 
flame flashes out at you. You are dazed, and 
the fyrsnaca automatically gains the initiative 
in the following rounds. Return to 417 and 
finish the battle. 

423. The great creature flails at the rock sur 
rounding you, trying to bury you in an ava 
lanche of debris. Roll Id20. If the number is 
greater than your Dexterity, go to 431. Oth 
erwise, go to 432. 

424. The hellish serpent knows it is dying. It 
breathes fire at you so it can flee. You, how 
ever, brave the flame and leap onto the great 
snake's back as it dives into the water. You 
sink one hand deep into the fatty folds of its 
neck and hold on tightly. Deeper and deeper 
you plunge into the dark depths. You ham 
mer at the snaca's head, blow after blow 
glancing off the slick hide. Yourlungs feel as if 
they will burst. In an attempt to dislodge you, 
the snake shoots back to the surface of the 
pool. Watery hands tear at you, trying to rip 
you off the fyrsnaca's back, but you hold 
tight. Suddenly, you both shoot into the air in 
a roar of steam and flame. The fyrsnaca lands 
again at pool's edge, and begins to roll, trying 
to crush you. You leap free, then strike out in 
a final attempt to kill the foul beast. Return to 
417 and finish the fight. 

425. In your weakness, you trip and fall. The 
fyrsnaca takes the opportunity to gloat over 
your vanquished form. You seize the moment 
and throw your weapon at the creature with 
all the strength you have left. "Barin!" you 
shout, as the weapon flies, "guide it true!" 
With a thud, the weapon hits, sinking deep 
into the putrid flesh. The fyrnaca receives 
normal damage for your weapon type, plus 
one point for each hit point you have left. The 
fyrsnaca roars in agony and rakes its neck 
against the wall. The weapon breaks loose 
and falls back into your lap. You crawl to your 
feet, ready to finish this fight. You have auto 
matic initiative on the following rounds. 
Return to 417 and finish the battle. 

426. To your horror, the great ruby misses 
the fyrsnaca's mouth, bounces off its horny 
head, and rolls into a corner. You must 
retrieve it, but have no time, for the foul ser 
pent lunges at you. You must fight the 


fyrsnaca. Ifyou hit, go to 433. Ifyou win, go 
to 430. 

Fyrsnaca: AC 5; HD 10*; hp 70; 
MV 60'(20'); #AT 1 bite or 1 breath; D 
1-8 or 2-12; ML 12; AL C 


427. The ruby disappears down the fyrsna 
ca's gaping maw. Thousands of sharp teeth 
suddenly tear at you. You block with your 
shield but it is ripped from your arm. It too 
disappears down the fyrsnaca's hungry 
throat. Chalcidar lied! You retreat, trying to 
gain time to prepare your weapon and rest 
your numbed arm. Suddenly, the fyrsnaca 
bellows in pain. You see the beast enveloped 
in flames! Shining through the creature's 
throat, you see the ruby. Heir's Arm's the 
monster with its own fire! Suddenly, the great 
thrashing snake smashes into a wall support 
ing the roof of this cavern, crushing the wall 
into rubble. The fyrsnaca lunges at you one 
more time, narrowly missing, but smashing 
the stone at your feet into dust. The cavern 
begins to collapse. Roll ld20. If the number 
is greater than your Dexterity, go to 428. 
Otherwise, go to 429. 

428. You slide into the hole that opens at your 
feet. Rubble falls on your leg, burying it. 
Water from the pool rushes in, filling the hole 
and will eventually rise above your head. The 
fyrsnaca continues to thrash about, pummel- 
ing the cavern stone into dust. You push at 
the rock on your leg, straining with all your 
might. It moves a bit, but the steaming water 
is already up to your waist. You pull on the 
rocks above, trying to drag yourself out of the 
hole. Finally your leg pulls free, and you 
crawl up to the floor of the room. Enormous 
boulders crash down about you, and you flee. 
Go to Section S4. 

429. You nearly slip into the newly-formed 
hole at your feet, but jump aside, falling to 
the floor. The fyrsnaca continues to thrash 
about, pummeling the cavern stone into dust. 
Enormous boulders crash down about you, 
and you flee. Go to Section S4. 

430. The fyrsnaca's movements become 
sluggish and erratic. You leap onto its back 
and raise your weapon high over your head. 
The fyrsnaca bucks, trying to throw you, but 
you press your knees tightly into its side. 
"Paradise is restored!" you scream, driving 
your weapon down into the great beast under 
you. You know it is a fatal blow. Cross off 5 
boxes on your Victory Record and go to Sec 
tion S4. 


32 













431. A large rock falls on your back, knock 
ing you to the ground. The fyrsnaca breathes 
fire at you. You roll quickly aside as the flame 
hits where you lay, splitting the stone with its 
heat. The fyrsnaca has the initiative automat 
ically in the coming rounds. Return to 417 
and finish the fight. 

432. You dodge nimbly away, then take a 
great stone from the ground and hurl it at the 
fyrsnaca's eye. It hits and the beast flails 
about in agony. You automatically have the 
initiative in the coming rounds. Return to 
417 and finish the battle. 

433. Your blow hits and the fyrsnaca plunges 
back into the water to cool its hurt. You leap 
for the ruby, pick it up, and hurl it again. Roll 
ld20. If the number is greater then your Dex 
terity, return to 426. Otherwise, go to 427. 

434. A dirty sack is popped over your head 
and your hands are bound. You are led from 
the room and down several corridors. It 
seems that you are moving to the south or 
southeast. Finally you halt, and you feel a 
cold iron hook being pushed through the 
ropes tying your hands. The blindfold is 
ripped front your eyes, and you are thrown 
out into a deep pit. You feel yourself falling 
and scream. Suddenly, you stop with a jerk, 
and your hands are torn back up above your 
head. You are hanging by a rope and hook 
over this open void. Your bandit captor and 
several others who have joined him, are 
laughing. "Enjoy yourself." they chuckle. 
"Let's get out of here," says the big one, 
"before they come for him." They all leave. 

You are in a ruined part of Thunderdelve. 
The floor has fallen into the huge pit over 
which you are swinging. You cannot see its 
bottom, for it is filled with noxious vapors 
that rise up toward you. You begin to get 
dizzy as you swing and twirl back and forth 
over the pit. You can wait to see who comes 
(435), try to stop your twirling (436), or try 
to increase your swing (437). 

435. You swing impatiently over the abyss, 
the fumes and vapors making you delirious. 
The bandits return later and find only an 


empty rope. This character has been lost. You 
must choose a new one. 

436. You try to counteract the rope's swing 
and find that you can. Gradually you stop. 
Your thoughts clear. You look above you and 
see that the rope is suspended from a beam. If 
you could reach the beam, you might be able 
to crawl along it back over the main floor, and 
then jump down. If you wish to try this dan 
gerous stunt, go to 438. Otherwise, you can 
shout for the bandits, telling them you will 
give them all your treasure if they free you 

(439) , or wait and muster your strength 

(440) . 

437. Gradually, you increase the swing of the 
rope. You are getting very dizzy. If you can 
retain your equilibrium, you will be able to 
swing over to the pit's edge. If you lose con 
trol, you could hit the sheer wall behind you. 
You can continue swinging (443) or try to 
stop the swinging before something terrible 
happens (436). 

438. With all the strength you can muster, 
you grasp the rope and begin to inch your 
way up toward the beam. Roll ld20. If the 
number is greater than your Strength, go to 
441. Otherwise, go to 442. 

439. You shout and shout, but no one 
answers. Then you hear slimy slitherings 
coming up out of the pit. You look over at the 
far wall and see great, fat, red worms crawl 
ing up it. They reach the beam over your 
head and crawl to where the rope is tied. One 
worm takes the rope in its mouth. You black 
out. The bandits return later and find noth 
ing of you or the rope. You have lost this char 
acter and must choose a new one. 

440. You sway over the abyss, but your 
strength does not return. Your hands go 
numb. Go to 435. 

441. You continue pulling yourself up, but 
the strain is very great. Most of your weight is 
on your fingers, and they are numb from the 
rope around your wrist. Suddenly you slip 
and fall. With a jerk, you stop as the rope 


reaches its length, but when you look back 
up, you can see it is badly frayed. You hang 
quietly to decide what to do. Go to 435. 

442. You reach the beam and pull yourself 
up. Gradually you work the iron hook out of 
your bonds. Now you must crawl over this 
slender beam with your hands tied. Roll 
ld20. If the number is greater than your Dex 
terity, go to 444. Otherwise, go to 445. 

443. You begin to swing almost out of control 
as you continue to arch your body back and 
forth. Roll ld20. If the number is greater 
than your Intelligence, go to 446. Otherwise, 
go to 445. 

444. Suddenly, you slip. You try to hang on 
with your numb hands, but your bonds are 
too tight. You cannot keep hold of the beam, 
and fall, landing on a narrow ledge below. 
You take 2-20 points of damage. If you sur 
vive, go to 204. 

445. With a final kick and shove, you reach 
the pit's edge and roll to the ground. You are 
safe. Quickly you bring your bonds to your 
teeth and loosen them. Rising, you flex your 
numb arms and hands, working feeling back 
into them. You have lost your weapon, shield, 
and all treasures except those marked on the 
Event Record. You must raise your Armor 
Class one point until you find another shield, 
and must fight with your hands until you find 
another weapon. When hitting with your 
fists, you do one point of damage, plus any 
Strength Bonus. Be sure to cross all treasure 
and weapons off your Equipment List, except 
for those recorded on the Event Record. Go 
to 190. 

446. The constant spinning, combined with 
the fumes, overcomes you. You become dis 
oriented and begin to spin wildly. Suddenly, 
you hit the wall and take 1-20 points of dam 
age. If you survive, go to 447. 

447. You struggle to retain consciousness. 
You can either continue to swing for the pit's 
edge (443) or try to make the rope stop before 
you kill yourself 436).

STORY ENDINGS 


Section S2 

Cross C off your Event Record. You bend 
down and scoop the unconscious Grona 
Marblefist up in your arms. You head south 
at a brisk pace. You enter the empty Front 
Hall. The front gate still stands ajar. As you 
pass through it, you hear a horse whinny 
behind the door on the south. You open the 
door, place Grona on one of the horses, and 
drive the other two outside. You then lead the 
horse and Grona back to town. 

When you come to the inn, the small boy 
you met there before hurries out. The boy 
leads you to the back room. 

Nimron opens the door to the back room and 
says, "Put her on the table." He opens a flask 
and pours a little of its contents down Grona's 
throat. She begins to revive. She whispers, "1 
think I know where the Hammer is." 

Nimron silences her with a stern look, then 
turns to you. "I trust you were able to find 
some treasure?" You shrug. "Good," he says. 
"Then if you will excuse us, we have some 
very important Clan Business to discuss. I'm 
sure you understand that no outsider can be 
present. "Thank you again." He gently 
pushes you out of the room and shuts the 
door. 

Days pass. You spend a good deal of your 
new wealth. You have rented the best room in 
the inn, have eaten more, and partied more 
than you have for many years. Then one 
groggy morning when you are lying in bed 
much later than usual, there is a knock at 
your door. In steps the same young boy you 
met before. "Please. Nimron wishes to see 
you," he pleads. 

"You see," Nimron says. "I must ask you 
to return and complete Grona's quest. "She 
has been seeking the great artifact of 
Thunderdelve-the Hammer of Vitroin. It 
was designed to defend the halls against 
wyrm attacks of any sort. But the fyrsnaca 
attacked so suddenly that no defense was pos 
sible and the Hammer was lost somewhere in 
the debris. Without it there is little or no 
chance of killing the fyrsnaca. And the need is 
urgent-so urgent we must ask for your help. 
After breeding, the fyrsnaca sleeps for 50 
years and then rises in fury. They have been 
known to destroy everything within a hun 
dred miles in the first passions of their 
waking. And 50 years have just passed. The 
fyrsnaca could awake at any time. 

"We ask you," Nimron says, "to retrieve 
the Hammer and bring it back. If you do so, 
it will restore Grona. Then she can return 
and destroy the Fyrsnaca." 


"You will be rewarded, says Nimron. "We 
do not know where the Hammer lies. Grona's 
first guess was wrong. But should it lie 
beyond the Falls, you will need the Words of 
Passing to open the great doors there. If you 
desire to pass, speak "Barin's Forge!" and 
the way will be opened. Now go. Her need is 
urgent. Do not fail us." 

You nod and ride off toward the mountain. 
Go to Entry 1. Cross off Z on your Event 
Record. While exploring the halls of Thun 
derdelve, ignore any references to goblins, 
bandits, or wolves. They have all fled after 
your slaying of Redface. You may explore 
their rooms, but they will not be in them. 

Section S3 

With the Hammer in hand, you hurry 
back to the front gate. You notice that as you 
pass, the stone underfoot is healed of 
blemishes-loose stone is made whole, 
cracked stone is welded shut. And where 
there are gaps, the stone reforms! It would 
appear that the Hammer spoke literally when 
it said it was made to heal Paradise. 

You reach the front gate, but it is a wall of 
solid stone! "You cannot take me from here," 
says the hammer. "You may have the will, 
but you will never have the means." You put 
it in the semi-circular stone table, under some 
of the debris. 

You turn back and find that the gate is 
where it is supposed to be. Your pony waits 
outside. You mount and ride quickly back to 
the glen where you left Nimron and Grona. 

Nimron says, "I knew the Hammer was 
loathe to leave without good cause, but I 
thought surely the healing of the Keeper 
would be just cause enough. I told Vitroin his 
prohibitions were too strict!" 

Nimron then mutters quietly, "Would you 
honor us by returning and slaying the 
fyrsnaca?" He you his flask. "There is not 
much relief left in it, but you are welcome to 
what there is." 

You drink and are healed of 2-12 points of 
damage. "You must now enter the Crystal 
Caves. The key lies somewhere in my rooms. 
Now go, I have felt the fyrsnaca stirring 
below. Her time of waking is near." 

You mount and return to the mountain. 
You find the hammer, take it firmly in hand, 
and say, "It's time to find the fyrsnaca. 

You must now make your own way from 
the front gate. Ignore references to bandits, 
goblins, or wolves. They have not returned in 
the short time you were gone. 


Section S4 

With its last convulsions, the fyrsnaca tears 
down the remaining stone. The cavern col 
lapses as you flee, rock and dust falling on 
your heels. Nothing remains of the cavern; 
the fyrsnaca is destroyed! 

Slowly you return to the Great Hall where 
the Heir's stone shines brightly from its lofty 
perch. At the pillar's base, you lay the Ham 
mer of Vitroin (if you have it). You then pass 
through the front gates, mount your pony, 
and ride to Nimron's glen. 

If both K and C are crossed off your Event 
Record, go to S9. Otherwise, go to S10. 

Section S5 

From your pack, you take out the private 
mementos you brought back for Nimron and 
Grona. A tear runs down Nimron's cheek as 
he embraces you. "My friend," he says, "I 
would you were my child." Grona too, looks 
at you with deep gratitude. Go to S6. 

Section S6 

"I have wandered long," you say. "I know I 
am not part of your Clan, but I would make 
Paradise my home. I long to see it in its 
former glory. If N is crossed off your Event 
Record, go to S8. Otherwise, go to S7. 

Section S7 

"I accept your devotion," says Nimron. "but 
I must reject your offer. We are a Clan, not a 
family. It is to shame we return, not glory. For it 
is ever to our shame that by your glory alone 
has Paradise been redeemed. We are grateful 
for all you have done, but we must labor in pri 
vacy in order to redeem our own past." 

"I think it best if I leave now and let you has 
ten to your work. The sooner you do, the 
sooner your shame will be redeemed. You forget 
I have seen Paradise, and you have far to go 
before you attain it." You spur your pony to the 
edge of the glen. "I will return," you call back, 
then dig in your heels and ride away, an 
unwanted saviour in a thankless land. 

Section S8 

"You have not told all," Nimron says. 
"You have seen far more than you speak. You 
have touched the Heart of the Stone." 

"Yes," you say. You climbed the pillar and 
touched the Heir's Stone in the Great Hall of 
Thunderdelve. There you fell and dreamed a 
dream of fire, of cleansing, of Paradise 
purged and redeemed. 


35 


"You have received the Heir's Dream. All 
you have done has been by right," Nirnron 
says. "It was your right to wield the hammer, 
to confront the fyrsnaca, for Thunderdelve is 
yours and all within it, too." 

"How think you Heir's Stone came by its 
name?" he asks. "Its purpose it to choose the 
heir of Thunderdelve should a Clanmaster be 
childless. And I was childless, heirless, until 
you received the Heir's Dream. Now you are 
my child. You are the chosen heir of Paradise. 
All is yours." 

You stand dumb-founded while Nimron 
calls to the other dwarves. "Friends, greet 
more than a brave warrior when you greet 
this, my child. Greet here the Heir of Thun 
derdelve, receiver of the Dream!" 

Section S9 

Nimron is in the glen with a great many 
dwarves. They all greet you as a great hero 
and help you down from your horse, bringing 
you food, drink, and fresh raiment. But you 


are tired and signal them away. You wish to 
speak privately with Grona and Nimron first. 
If Q, S, or T is crossed off your Event 
Record, go to S5. Otherwise, go to S6. 

Section S10 

Nimron stands in the glen with a many 
dwarves, his hand raised in the air. All is 
silent. Something is wrong. Nimron lets his 
arm fall and a net falls over you, sweeping 
you off your pony and onto the ground. You 
struggle to stand but cannot. Many dwarves 
surround you, disarm you, and help you 
struggle to your feet. "What have I done?" 
you shout. "I have slain the Fyrsnaca." 

Nimron speaks, "By so doing you have 
betrayed us. You were sent to aid Grona 
Marblefist, not to usurp her place of honor, 
but to succor her in her hour of need." 

Quickly you recount all that has befallen 
you. You tell of your struggles and of your 
victories. And you tell of your triumph over 
the fyrsnaca. 


Nimron approaches and stares deeply into 
your eyes, searching for an answer. If N is 
crossed off your Event Record, go to S8. Oth 
erwise, go to SI 1. 

Section SI1 

"I warned you not to attempt more than 
you were asked. And I warned you that 
much, including your own life, depended on 
your obedience. Now," says Nimron, "let 
your fate be on your own head." He spins and 
walks away. Many dwarves fall on you, strip 
ping you of your treasure, armor, and weap 
ons. They leave you standing in your shirt, 
chill in the evening air. 

"Do not hasten to return," says Nimron. 
"Paradise will not hold a welcome for you." 

You turn and ride off, pausing only long 
enough to pick up a cache of half of your trea 
sure you had been smart enough to hide when 
you first came out of Thunderdelve. You ride 
on, ready to spend your new wealth at first 
chance. 


The Group Adventure 

Do not read this section until after you have 
finished playing the solo adventure! 

This group adventure is recommended for 
5-8 characters of levels 4-6 or 2-3 characters 
oflevels 7-9. You need to make few changes in 
order to play with a group. Those changes are 
outlined below. 

1) It is recommended that the fighter, 
Redface, the thief, Zemon Trist, and the 
cleric, Bearfang, be used to their full capacity. 
The DM should not restrict their actions to 
those given in the text if the players' actions 
necessitate change. The NPCs should be 
played as real, intelligent people, fully capa 
ble of reacting to changing circumstances. 
Their statistics follow. Should Redface be 
slain, the remaining bandits and goblins will 
be eager to flee if they can do so safely. 

2) Redface's alliance with the goblin leader, 
Oclist, is tenuous at best, but Oclist will 
almost always obey Redface because he is 
afraid of hint and relishes the treasure he 
gains in Redface's service. Odist's goblins 
fear both him and Redface, fearing only 
Oliv, the cook more. If it becomes apparent 
that Thunderdelve has been invaded, 
Redface will order the goblins out to patrol 
the halls in groups of five, or to attack in uni 
son if the invaders have been located. 


Redface (6th level fighter): AC 4; hp 38; MV 
90'(30'): #AT 1 ;D3-11; ML 10; AL C 

Redface is never without his magic sword, 
Render, and makes full use of its capabilities, 
including the darts + 1. He wears a ring of 
wolf control and will bring his wolves into 
combat with him, if possible. 

Render: sword + 2, + 3 vs. undead; Int 10; 
Ego 9; Will 19; AL C 

This sword is capable of speech and uses 
its ability often. It is very opinionated. For 
tunately, it and Redface usually agree. Its 
powers are: find secret doors, see invisible, 
detect evil. The sword can also fire two 
spring-loaded darts + 1 out of its hilt at the 
press of a button. It can then automatically 
locate these darts if they are within 100 feet. 


They can then be reloaded. The darts' 
range is 50 feet and each does 2-5 points of 
damage. 

Zemon Trist (4th level thief): AC 6; hp 16; 
MV 120'(40');#AT 1:D 1-8; ML 7; AL N 

Trist wears a cloak of invisibility which is 
activated by pulling the hood up over his 
head. Be sure to note his morale. 

Bearfang (4th level cleric): AC 5; hp 17; 
MV90'(30');#AT 1; D 2-7; ML 9; ALC 

Bearfang has a mace + 1. He is also capa 
ble of commanding his trained bear and 
usually goes into battle with the bear at his 
side, if possible. He has memorized the fol 
lowing spells: cure light wounds, darkness, 
hold person. 


3) The number of monsters and men in each 
encounter should be doubled. The indicated 
rolls for treasure should also be doubled, but 
the actual treasures listed in the encounter 
should not be increased. 

A complete listing of the numbers of men 
and goblins in Thunderdelve is: 

* 4 Leaders: Redface, Trist, Bearfang, Oclist 

* 25 Bandits total in rooms 1,4,7,15,19,24, 
29,31 


* 25 Goblins total in rooms 19,21,22 

4) The answers to riddles and clues should 
not automatically be given, as they were in 
the solo adventure, simply by virtue of check 
ing the Event Record. The DM may still use 
the Event Record to help him keep track of 
events, but should allow the players to figure 
out the runes and answers on their own. If 
they discover what to do, the DM can then 
read the proper entry to them. 


36 




5) Remember that in a group adventure, 
men and monsters are not limited to the 
rooms in which they are listed. If players 
make a great deal of noise, someone or some 
thing should come check. Likewise, players 
should not be limited by the choices printed 
in the entries. Players will most probably 
think of options not listed. The DM must be 
flexible enough to allow for this, for from this 
innovation will come much of the richness of 
a group adventure. 

Paradise Restored 

Once the players have defeated the fyrsnaca, 


Nimron will attempt to restore Thunderdelve to 
a fully operative dwarfliome. This adventure 
can then be used as the basis for further adven 
tures. Any surviving bandits take up residence 
in a cave complex a few miles away. If Redface, 
Trist, or Bearfang have survived, they are with 
the bandits. The surviving goblins do not go 
with the bandits, but they also take up residence 
not far from Thunderdelve. They send for their 
relatives and attempt to prevent the dwarves 
from rebuilding by raiding supply trains or the 
outer halls of Thunderdelve, by driving away 
wildlife and food animals, by setting fires, and 
by laying ambushes for dwarven travelers. 

With the powers of the Hammer of 


Vitroin, the stone of Thunderdelve will be 
rebuilt and the pit closed. The worms and 
other monsters will be slain. Thunderdelve 
will be a working clanhome with a forge. Old 
Nimron will be clanmaster still, but there will 
be no Keeper until a new one can be trained. 
IfGrona Marblefist has survived, she will be 
trained for the position by virtue of her birth. 
If she is dead, some other NPC will be 
trained. In no case will Nimron or any other 
dwarf of Thunderdelve consent to training a 
player as Keeper! Listed below are the uses 
for each room once the dwarves return to 
power. The DM must make maps of the 
mines and lower quarters.

Further Adventure Scenarios 

1) Nimron hires the players to clear out the rest of 
the monsters inhabiting Thunderdelve immedi 
ately after the fyrsnaca's defeat. This would 
require the players to journey into the reopened 
mines below Paradise, where they confront more 
red worms, undead, and new horrors. Their goal 
would be to clear a path to the Forge. 

2) After the new Keeper is trained and 
returns to working the Forge, it is discovered 
that some evil power has laid hold of the 
Forge during the years it lay buried and dor 
mant. None of its powers work! At the same 
time, dwarf miners are found randomly 


slain in isolated parts of the mine. The play 
ers must find and destroy whatever horror 
lurks in the mines. They discover that it is a 
creature similar to watery Chalcidar, only 
this one is able to take form in stone and move 
about the mines. Possible ways of overcom 
ing it would include a quest to discover a 
helm or necklace similar to those which com 
mand and bind Chalcidar. 

3) The bandits are still raiding passing cara 
vans and harassing the region. Some mer 
chants hire the players to get rid of the 
bandits for good. Unfortunately, the players 
don't realize that a powerful magic-user has 
taken Redface's old place! 


4) Nimron hires the players to clean out the 
goblin lair. The players find that many more 
goblins have joined their relatives and brought 
along bugbears, ogres, thouls, and other nasty 
friends. There might even be a new chief- 
perhaps a stone giant. He, of course, would 
have friends and family of his own. 

5) Nimron dies and a bloody civil war is 
threatening to break out in Thunderdelve 
over who his heir should be. It would be up to 
the players to try to reunite the warring fac 
tions. What they would not realize is that the 
hot-headed rebels are led by some dopple- 
gangers who have replaced the real dwarves.

These grotesque worms resemble mounds 
of pulsating red flesh. They reach lengths of 
10 feet and diameters of 2 feet. They are the 
immature spawn of the fyrsnaca. If these 
worms are encountered, a dormant fyrsnaca 
will be cooling in a nearby lake. The worms 
cannot breathe fire, but their bite is mildly 
venomous. Those failing a Save vs. Poison 
receive double damage from any bite. After 
50 years of living in a large group, usually 
only one worm will survive to become a 
fyrsnaca. These worms are unintelligent but 
can burrow through rock and surprise their 
victims 50% of the time.

Although not 

quite as large as their purple 


cousins, these fiery snakes reach lengths of 70 
feet and diameters of 10 feet. They burrow 
through the earth eating rich ores and miner 
als. They are not carnivorous but are quick to 
anger. They breathe a line of fire (50' x 5') 
and can use it repeatedly during combat 
(indicated by a roll of 5 or 6). 

Normally solitary, they occasionally enter 
a breeding cycle. During this time, their inte 
rior fires burn much hotter, doing no extra 
damage, but spawning the hideous red 
worms. Immediately afterward, the fyrsnaca 
must submerge in a large body of water or be 
consumed by its own heat. The fyrsnaca will 
then remain dormant for 50 years unless dis 
turbed. If disturbed, it will rise in fury, fight 
ing with high morale, for it knows that it 
cannot leave the water without perishing. 
The fyrsnaca is intelligent and can be bar 
gained with to perform tasks.

These creatures form in areas of strife 
where the vapors are heavy. They cannot 
stray far from their spot of origin, but need 
not remain in contact with it. They can only 
be harmed by magic and magical weapons. 
They may be turned as wraiths. Anyone hit 
by one must make a successful Saving Throw 
vs. Paralysis or be mind-paralyzed. This 
mind-paralysis causes the character to con 
tinue his present activity until this mind- 
paralysis wears off in 2-8 rounds. Also, each 
hit lowers the character's Intelligence by 1 
point. A character reduced to zero Intelli 
gence is insane for 2-20 days. The lost Intelli 
gence will return at the rate of 1 point per day. 


1. The wielder must make a Control Check if 
he refuses to attack the wyrm; 

2. The wielder gains + 2 on all saving throws 
during the battle; 

3. The wielder can be cured by the Hammer 
of light wounds (2-7 points of damage) up to 3 
times daily. The Hammer is absolutely con 
nected to the Clanhome of Thunderdelve and 
will vehemently resist being taken from the 
halls unless for the purpose of fighting a 
nearby wyrm. If the wielder tries to take it for 
any different purpose, more powers are man 
ifest: 

4. The Hammer can ESP the wielder to 
determine his true purpose; 

5. The Hammer can cast a Wall of Stone spell 
(6/day in Thunderdelve, I/day outside) to 
block the exit from Thunderdelve; 

6. The Hammer will force a Control Check; 

7. The Hammer can also use its stone- 
creating powers to repair any damage to the 
actual structure of Thunderdelve itself.

COMBAT FLOW CHART 


1. Determine Who has Initiative! 

(Usually the monster does.) 

2. Determine the Hit Roll! 

(Compare the monster's hit dice or the character's level to the 
armor class of the target on the appropriate Hit Roll table.) 

3. Roll Id20 to hit foe! 

(If the roll is equal to or greater than the Hit Roll number, you 
hit.) 

4. Determine damage caused! 

(Roll the damage noted for the monster or the weapon of the 
character and subtract the total from the hit points of the tar 
get. If no weapon is noted for the character, presume he has a 
war hammer, D 1-6.) 

5. Determine if the number rolled has a special result! 

(If it did, turn to the entry noted.) 

6. Is either side defeated? 


39 


(If not, it is now the other sides turn to attack, return to deter 
mining the Hit Roll.)

Expert Solo Adventure 



Thunderdelve Mountain 

by William Carlson 



The ancient dwarven kingdom of wonder and 
fable is no more! Only the tales of it's grandeur 
remain to entertain the children, or so you 
thought. 

Then you met Nimron. Distraught and desper 
ate, you alone can pass the gates sealed so 
long ago. Within are the lairs of bandits, cut 
throats, and worse. The evil that destroyed the 
dwarven home-the Halls of Paradise-is 
awakened again. Into this horror ventured the 
dwarven princess Grona Marblefist to reclaim 
her kingdom. She, like so many others, has not 
returned. 


Now you must face this peril alone. 

Thunderdelve Mountain is a solitaire adven 
ture for the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS' Expert 
game. Players who don't wish to face the fallen 
Halls of Paradise alone may also use this 
adventure for group play. 

This adventure is for use with the DUNGEONS & 
DRAGONS' Expert game and cannot be played 
without both the Basic and Expert rules.
