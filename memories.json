The primary objective is to transform a basic conceptual overview document created by a content expert into fully detailed program proposals for three stacked credentials: Basic Technical Certificate (BTC), Intermediate Technical Certificate (ITC), and Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree. This work requires translating industry-focused \"Sprint\" terminology into proper academic course structures aligned with Carnegie units and institutional standards. The program centers around a unifying Virtual Idaho State University (VISU) project where students collaboratively recreate the ISU campus in interactive 3D format across the curriculum progression.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn has established the foundational structure for all three credential levels, with the BTC comprising 24 credits (four 6-credit courses), the ITC adding Year 2 courses for 48 total credits, and the AAS including 15 additional general education credits for 63 total credits. The original Sprint framework has been successfully translated into academic courses: Sprint 1 became IMD 1101/1102 (Core Design), Sprint 2 became IMD 1121/1122 (Architectural Visualization/Environmental Art), Sprint 3 became IMD 2201/2202 (Interactive Systems), and Sprint 4 became IMD 2221/2222 (Production Optimization/Cinematic Production & Portfolio). Detailed learning outcomes, industry certification pathways, stakeholder involvement descriptions, and articulation agreements have been developed for each credential level.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nA critical insight emerged around software naming conventions: avoiding proprietary software names like \"Blender\" and \"Photoshop\" in favor of generic terms like \"industry-standard 3D modeling software\" and \"professional image editing software\" maintains curriculum flexibility and longevity. However, \"Unreal Engine\" can be referenced as a platform without version numbers. The importance of creating flexible course descriptions became clear, particularly with the \"Special Topics\" course (IMD 1196) that can accommodate prior learning assessment and transfer credit situations without explicitly stating those purposes. The systematic approach of starting with the shortest credential (BTC) and building upward proved effective for maintaining coherence across the stacked credential structure.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn works systematically through each credential level, beginning with the foundational BTC and building complexity upward. The approach emphasizes translating industry concepts into academic frameworks while maintaining practical relevance.

The core research question examines how iterative design processes of barrier-focused diagnostics reveal theoretical insights about scalable individualized learning and what design principles emerge for institutional implementation. This work centers on understanding the tension between barrier and deficit terminology in higher education assessment contexts, rather than broad educational theory. The research involves comprehensive literature review work across multiple project libraries to build a complete picture of existing scholarship in this area.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn is actively conducting literature review work, having created multiple project libraries to organize and upload research materials. They are systematically reviewing these libraries against a comprehensive literature review overview they developed to identify gaps and strengths in coverage. Recent analysis revealed that their current project library contains exceptionally strong coverage of the core barrier versus deficit framework, including comprehensive documentation of deficit thinking critique, barrier-focused alternatives, assessment validity issues, and institutional practices that reproduce deficit assumptions. The literature review overview has been updated to reflect these newly discovered strengths rather than previously identified gaps.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nClayn has additional unaccessed project libraries related to the overall study that need to be reviewed using the updated literature review overview.

Due to the scope of materials, Clayn has organized the research across multiple project libraries to accommodate extensive file uploads, requiring cross-library synthesis and comparison against existing overview documents to ensure comprehensive coverage.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn is actively synthesizing findings from distributed project libraries, comparing new evidence against existing theoretical frameworks and coverage assessments. Recent work involved updating a comprehensive overview document titled \"Evidence of AI disruption in assessment and other impacts in higher ed\" based on newly discovered evidence in project libraries. This process revealed substantial gaps between existing documentation and available research, leading to significant updates that elevated coverage assessments from \"partially addressed\" to \"strong\" or \"exceptionally strong\" across multiple dimensions.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nThe literature review has identified three major theoretical contributions emerging from the research: an AI Assessment Validity Crisis Framework, an Institutional AI Adaptation Framework, and a Synthetic Assessment Framework. Key findings include comprehensive documentation of ChatGPT's ability to bypass plagiarism detection tools, policy analysis revealing varied institutional responses across universities, and evidence of fundamental challenges to traditional assessment validity frameworks. The research demonstrates that AI disruption in higher education extends beyond simple cheating concerns to encompass systemic challenges requiring new theoretical approaches to assessment and institutional adaptation.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn employs systematic cross-library comparison methodology, using targeted multi-faceted search strategies to build comprehensive coverage of research themes.

The project addresses significant institutional challenges: employees struggle with writing self-assessments, there's inconsistency across departments and reviewers, and the process is particularly difficult for those who have trouble expressing themselves in writing or accurately representing their accomplishments. The goal is to create an AI-agnostic solution that functions like a \"biographer or investigative reporter,\" helping employees capture authentic details about their work through guided conversations, then synthesizing those details into polished narratives ready for ISU's institutional performance review system.\n\nThe system is designed to work within ISU's existing four-category evaluation framework (Customer Focus, Employee Productivity, Employee Professionalism, and Leadership) and accommodate the institution's five performance levels ranging from \"Does Not Meet\" through \"Consistently Exceeds.\" Success means creating a practical tool that can be implemented across the university with any AI platform (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.) and requires decision-maker approval from administrators unfamiliar with generative AI.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn has completed the core system design consisting of four main components: Pre-Interview Setup, Flexible Thematic Interview Guide, Final Output Generator, and User Guide - each kept to approximately two pages for practical usability. The approach centers on a thematic interview system designed for realistic time constraints, with sessions lasting 25-30 minutes total. The system has been validated against actual ISU performance evaluation documents and a completed evaluation example, confirming alignment with institutional requirements.\n\nA critical breakthrough was recognizing the need for a \"handoff summary\" system to maintain continuity between AI sessions when memory isn't available across platforms. This ensures the conversational approach remains effective regardless of which AI tool employees choose to use.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nThe project revealed that initial category-specific approaches with extensive question sets (10-14 questions per category) were unrealistic for the intended timeframe. The more effective approach emerged as flexible, thematic interviews that can adapt to individual employee experiences while still covering all required evaluation areas.\n\nA fundamental insight was that without AI memory between sessions, continuity requires explicit handoff mechanisms - each session must end with a summary that transfers to the next session. This discovery shaped the entire system architecture around AI-agnostic design principles, ensuring the tool works across different platforms rather than being tied to any specific AI service.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe system leverages Google Drive integration for accessing institutional documents, with effective search strategies using both API query parameters ('name contains' operators, 'parents' parameter with folder IDs) and semantic queries. Key institutional resources include the \"Performance-Evaluation-Matrices-2022\" document providing the detailed rubric structure, and completed evaluation examples that serve as validation benchmarks for the system's output quality.", "019a35be-e9b5-763d-a2c5-b495240ca5b0": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is actively engaged in \"The Magician's Gambit,\" a tabletop RPG campaign set in Lev Grossman's The Magicians universe using the Open Legend system. The campaign takes place at Brakebills magical university during a crisis where magic is dying worldwide, prompting expanded admissions under Dean Solomon Hopper's controversial initiative. Clayn plays Cyrus Lunkshill, a brilliant hacker from suburban New Jersey who interprets all magical phenomena through a technology lens, believing he's testing experimental AI when actually being manipulated by an extradimensional entity called \"Aether.\"\n\nThe campaign runs on the Myth-Weavers platform as collaborative roleplay writing. Clayn values authentic character development over relationship-focused roleplay, preferring exploration and action while maintaining politeness and character consistency. Success involves creating realistic character interactions that advance plot while avoiding clich\u00e9d behaviors, novella-length responses, and tired internal dialogue.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn is actively developing Cyrus's integration with other player characters at Brakebills, focusing on connection strategies that feel natural rather than forced. Recent scenes have involved orientation activities, study group formations, and technical troubleshooting sessions where Cyrus's devices experience magical interference. The character is navigating the tension between his paranoid hacker instincts (viewing organized gatherings as potential honeypots) and his need to connect with fellow students.\n\nCurrent character dynamics include collaborations with Nettle Taylor, Ari Solomon, Jonathan Baxton, Amalie, Saffron, and others. Clayn is working on a \"Ghost in the Shell\" concept where a sentient entity lives in the school's electrical infrastructure, feeding on power and causing device malfunctions.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nClayn has developed strong preferences for authentic character portrayal, particularly around hacker culture accuracy. Real hackers avoid formal conferences and organized gatherings, viewing them as suspicious federal operations. Authentic hacker interactions happen online, and physical meetups of more than three people raise immediate red flags.\n\nCharacter consistency requires Cyrus to remain oblivious to magic while maintaining his technical worldview. The character works best when his paranoid security instincts and methodical problem-solving approach drive interactions rather than social desperation. Family considerations are important - Cyrus lives with engaged parents and two siblings, requiring official documentation and explanations for major life changes.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn prefers collaborative workshopping over direct writing assistance, wanting to refine their own roleplay posts rather than having content written for them. They consistently request specific word counts (typically 150-250 words) and favor concise, natural dialogue that assumes cooperation rather than spelling out every concern.\n\nThe creative process involves multiple revision cycles, with Clayn providing detailed feedback to refine character voice, narrative flow, and scene integration. They demonstrate attention to continuity, ensuring new content connects with previously established story elements and other players' contributions. Scene development focuses on creating natural collision points between characters and advancing multiple story functions simultaneously.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe campaign utilizes Google Drive for document sharing and the Myth-Weavers platform for collaborative posting. Clayn references Lev Grossman's The Magicians universe for world-building consistency and draws from authentic hacker culture knowledge to maintain character accuracy. They incorporate pop culture references, particularly WarGames, Indiana Jones, and Ghost in the Shell, to enhance character voice and technical analogies.\n\nCharacter development draws from detailed technical knowledge of networking, cybersecurity, and hacker methodologies to create authentic dialogue and problem-solving approaches.", "0199775f-02c8-7287-9839-4362f521d3f6": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is developing a comprehensive academic research paper on barrier-focused diagnostics in instructional design, targeting an EDUCAUSE audience for a 2026 conference presentation followed by journal publication. This work emerged from 133 AI-assisted design thinking transcripts documenting their response to AI disruption in higher education assessment during summer 2024. The research positions barrier diagnostics as a systematic instructional design innovation that leverages institutional flexibility created by AI disruption to finally implement individualized, process-focused learning approaches that have been pedagogically preferred since the 1980s but remained practically unscalable.\n\nThe barrier diagnostics framework represents one component of Clayn's larger STACK research program, deliberately bounded to avoid analysis creep while building toward broader pedagogical innovations. The work focuses specifically on shifting from deficit-based to barrier-focused assessment, moving from external rubrics to student self-accountability, and creating systematic connections between barrier identification and targeted interventions. Success is measured by developing publication-quality academic prose that demonstrates how AI disruption creates opportunities for implementing theoretically sound but previously impractical individualized instruction approaches.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn is actively working on Section 2 of their literature assessment, having completed substantial work on Section 1. They're in the midst of refining specific paragraphs that establish tensions between process-oriented learning theories and product-focused assessment practices, incorporating sources across cognitive mediational paradigm, integrated approaches, and complexity theory. Recent work involved developing two key paragraphs: one establishing theoretical tensions (expanded from 135 to 173 words) and another on self-regulation as a bridge between process and product (expanded from 71 to target 175 words).\n\nThe writing process involves multiple revision cycles addressing citation integration, grammar, theoretical flow, and disciplinary connections. Clayn has been rebuilding academic writing skills after time away, working through structured exercises including source integration practice and transition flow work. They've developed approximately 590 words of publication-quality prose across four complete paragraphs in Section 1, progressing from initial drafts with common issues to polished paragraphs with smooth source integration and clear argumentation.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nClayn has established that outlines should be treated as flexible frameworks rather than prescriptive requirements, noting that rigid adherence to predetermined structures proved problematic when deeper reading of sources suggested better alternatives. They consistently prioritize substance over adherence to predetermined structures, demonstrating strong authorial judgment in source selection and revision priorities.\n\nA core insight is that AI disruption created institutional flexibility to implement individualized, process-focused learning approaches that have been pedagogically preferred but remained practically unscalable. The research documents four critical breakthrough moments: the shift from deficit-based to barrier-focused assessment, the assessment philosophy revolution moving toward student self-accountability, AI integration philosophy evolution, and systematic barrier-to-intervention mapping.\n\nStrategic source selection proves crucial - Clayn makes deliberate substitutions when sources are \"much more explicit\" in addressing specific theoretical conversations, choosing depth and relevance over predetermined source lists.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn's research methodology combines design-based research with critical incident analysis, systematically analyzing breakthrough moments documented in AI collaboration transcripts. They conduct comprehensive literature assessments section by section, evaluating existing sources against outlined requirements and identifying critical gaps through targeted literature searches.\n\nThe writing process follows structured academic exercises including citation sandwich technique, source integration practice, and transition flow work. Revision cycles address multiple layers: opening clarity, citation integration, grammar corrections, theoretical flow, and disciplinary connections. Clayn prefers specific, actionable feedback with numbered issues, side-by-side comparisons, concrete word/phrase suggestions, and clear revision options while maintaining control over argument direction.\n\nLiterature organization follows hierarchical folder structures with numbered sections and subsections, enabling systematic assessment and gap identification. When conducting searches to fill literature gaps, combining historical terms with contemporary applications proves particularly effective for bridging theory-practice gaps.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nClayn's research corpus includes 133 AI transcripts stored in Google Drive following consistent \"DBR ###\" naming conventions, documenting collaborative conversations during framework development.

The project targets publication following an EDUCAUSE 2026 presentation, positioning the work at the intersection of educational technology and instructional design for a higher education audience.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn is actively developing a research paper on barrier-focused diagnostics for individualized learning, having completed systematic analysis of research artifacts and established a solid theoretical foundation using DBR methodology. The barrier-focused diagnostic framework has evolved into the central innovation\u2014a streamlined approach that replaces traditional competency rating scales with a single question identifying whether students face cognitive, applicative, or affective barriers, transforming assessment from deficit-focused evaluation to growth-oriented barrier recognition.\n\nThe research has undergone strategic pivots, including moving from composition studies to instructional design focus, reframing from AI crisis management to addressing scalability challenges in personalized learning, and refining research questions to focus on theoretical contributions and design principles that can be supported by existing transcript data rather than premature implementation outcomes.\n\nClayn has established comprehensive documentation systems, including a Research Artifact Index Template for systematic analysis and organization of all 133 research artifacts, with detailed categorization across multiple dimensions including research phase, methodology, priority levels, and thematic groupings.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThe immediate next phase involves transitioning from problem statement development to literature review construction in a separate project space, maintaining the established pattern of using different projects for different paper sections. Clayn plans to present findings at EDUCAUSE 2026 before pursuing journal publication, requiring continued refinement of the theoretical framework and empirical support.\n\nFuture work includes completing the systematic analysis of remaining research artifacts, developing operational definitions for measuring effort and risk as learning metrics, and addressing implementation questions about how students learn to distinguish between barrier types. The research trajectory points toward broader applications of the barrier diagnostic framework beyond the initial CTE and ethics course contexts.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nA fundamental insight emerged that AI disruption, while initially appearing as a crisis requiring management, actually created unprecedented opportunities to address previously \"unattainable goals\" in personalized education that Clayn had \"given up on trying to do\" earlier in their career. The disruption provided institutional flexibility to finally implement trauma-informed assessment and individualized barrier interventions at scale.\n\nThe design process revealed the importance of authentic documentation over theoretical constraints, with Clayn emphasizing that students \"didn't deserve half-measures\" bounded by what science would allow rather than the best possible course design. Complex solutions like chip allocation systems and tick box visualizations were explored and abandoned, with these \"dead ends\" viewed as essential evidence of authentic design thinking rather than failures.\n\nA critical methodological principle established that everything in the research \"keys off the problem,\" requiring crystal clear foundational understanding before proceeding to subsequent sections. The barrier diagnostic approach proved more practically valuable than broader philosophical arguments about \"process over product\" approaches, offering operational specificity that other educators can implement.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn employs highly systematic and methodical approaches to research organization and documentation. Work is structured into separate projects for different paper sections, with each serving as both creative discussion space and bibliography manager. The research follows rigorous DBR protocols with comprehensive artifact indexing using specific templates and consistent formatting standards.\n\nThe approach emphasizes iterative development through AI-mediated design conversations, with systematic documentation of the entire design process rather than just final outcomes. Clayn maintains strict quality control standards, demanding systematic file processing, consistent formatting, and thorough verification of all research components.\n\nDecision-making follows a hierarchical structure, with clear delimitations (peer-reviewed sources newer than 2015 from postsecondary settings only) and systematic scope management. The research methodology prioritizes authentic practitioner insights over purely theoretical concerns, with strong emphasis on maintaining ethical academic integrity by ensuring all content is self-drafted with structural guidance rather than written material from external sources.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe research infrastructure centers on systematic organization of 133 AI conversation transcripts using alphanumeric DBR numbering systems (DBR 001-129) for efficient batch processing and analysis. Clayn utilizes Google Sheets for data management with comma-delimited CSV formatting for systematic research artifact analysis and bibliography management.\n\nAcademic research draws from multiple databases including ERIC, JSTOR, Education Source, and Google Scholar, with targeted search strategies using exact author names, publication years, and specific terminology combinations. The work integrates various AI systems documented throughout the design process, with particular focus on AI-as-conversation-partner frameworks for pedagogical innovation.\n\nThe research targets EDUCAUSE as the primary publication venue, requiring alignment with higher education technology audiences and institutional decision-makers concerned with scalable implementation of personalized learning approaches.", "019a74b3-cec1-7328-b923-c70e680f18df": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is redesigning TGE 1257 (Applied Ethics in Technology), a business ethics course for freshmen, transitioning from a freeform structure to a modular Canvas-based format for Spring 2026. The course serves university General Education \"Humanistic Ways of Knowing\" requirements and must comply with Quality Matters 7th edition standards. The innovative pedagogical approach uses an \"archaeological excavation\" metaphor where students discover existing ethical frameworks within their own reasoning patterns rather than learning theory first. Success is measured through authentic intellectual exploration and student agency rather than traditional performance metrics.\n\nThe course addresses a fundamental challenge in ethics education: helping students engage genuinely with philosophical complexity while maintaining personal safety around sensitive ethical dilemmas. Key stakeholders include freshman students navigating their first philosophy course, university administration requiring QM compliance and General Education outcomes assessment, and the broader goal of developing ethical reasoning skills for technology professionals.\n\n**Current state**\n\nThe course redesign is actively in progress, with a complete 7-module structure developed and Quality Matters compliance work underway. Recent focus has been on Standards 2-4, including learning objectives alignment, assessment documentation, and instructional materials citations. The \"Start Here\" module content is finalized, featuring Perusall-based introductory activities and AI Partnership Practice assignments.\n\nCurrent structure includes: personal ethical dilemma identification, decision-making heuristics discovery, conflict mapping between competing values, personalized learning roadmaps, exploration of 10 philosophical frameworks through AI conversations, and culminating self-assessment. The Heuristics Gallery Walk has been positioned strategically in Module 5 to meet QM interaction requirements while protecting student privacy.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nStudent agency and authentic engagement must take precedence over traditional academic performance structures. Self-assessment with collaborative instructor conversations proves more effective than prescriptive rubrics for genuine intellectual growth. AI serves most effectively as a thinking partner rather than an answer provider when students are guided toward exploration over solution-seeking.\n\nPrivacy protection around personal ethical dilemmas is essential - students need safety to explore genuinely complex situations without exposure. Timing dependencies in online courses (like discussion boards) penalize students with different schedules and should be avoided. Quality Matters compliance can be achieved while maintaining educational philosophy through strategic design choices like the Heuristics Gallery Walk.\n\nThe archaeological metaphor resonates strongly - students discover that formal philosophical frameworks already exist within their thinking patterns, making ethics feel accessible rather than abstract. Focusing on General Education outcomes assessment provides strategic compliance efficiency since these are the only institutionally reported results.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nCourse organization follows a self-paced modular structure to eliminate coordination problems common in online learning. Each module builds systematically: personal dilemma \u2192 existing heuristics \u2192 internal conflicts \u2192 framework exploration \u2192 integration. All activities are designed for individual completion with optional peer interaction to accommodate diverse student schedules and privacy needs.\n\nAssessment uses evidence-based self-evaluation where students propose grades supported by documentation of their intellectual journey. AI conversations are saved as learning artifacts, and Perusall annotations (6 per chapter) provide structured text engagement. The approach consistently prioritizes guidance questions over prescriptive criteria to preserve student autonomy while maintaining academic rigor.\n\nQuality Matters compliance is addressed systematically by standard, with particular attention to learning objectives alignment, assessment documentation, and instructional materials citations including Creative Commons licensing information.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nCanvas serves as the primary learning management system, transitioning from the previous landing page format. Perusall provides social annotation capabilities for text engagement and the introductory tutorial sequence. AI chatbots (various platforms) function as thinking partners for philosophical exploration, with conversation transcripts saved to Google Drive for documentation.\n\nKey instructional materials include \"The Business Ethics Workshop\" by Brusseau, \"Introduction to Ethics: An Open Educational Resource\" by Levin, \"The Point of Studying Ethics\" by Garlikov, \"What is a Moral (Ethical) Dilemma\" by Holt, and \"Ethical Explorations\" by Shea - all documented as Open Educational Resources with proper APA citations and Creative Commons licensing.\n\nGoogle Drive provides the organizational backbone for student documentation and learning artifacts. Quality Matters 7th edition rubric guides compliance efforts, with particular focus on Standards 2-4 for learning objectives, assessment, and instructional materials alignment.", "019a8401-29b7-700b-8583-0f199904f61d": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is the department chair for Business and Support Services in the College of Technology at Idaho State University and has been teaching in the Technical General Education program since 2002. They are currently redesigning their ENGL 1101 (English Composition I) course by adapting successful elements from a recently revised Ethics course that achieved Quality Matters (QM) standards compliance. The primary goal is creating a more structured, modular approach that addresses student confusion about course expectations while maintaining flexible pacing and preserving their self-assessment grading system.\n\nThe course is specifically designed for Career and Technical Education (CTE) students, emphasizing career-relevant writing with professional validation from CTE instructors. Clayn's innovative pedagogical approach combines ungrading/self-assessment philosophy with AI integration (Claude) as a thinking partner throughout the writing process. The course uses Open Educational Resources exclusively and incorporates dual credit opportunities where possible.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn has developed a comprehensive seven-part course structure (Parts 0-6) progressing from rhetorical situation awareness through research integration to capstone projects. The course features four progressive writing projects: Project 1 (rhetorical situation and genre), Project 2 (organization and structure for technical writing), Project 3 (research and APA citation), and a capstone project synthesizing all competencies with a mandatory reflection component.\n\nThey are currently conducting Quality Matters 7th Edition compliance analysis, having completed systematic review of QM Standards 1-6. The analysis revealed the course meets most QM standards well, with particular strengths in technology integration, learner interaction variety, and comprehensive policy documentation, while identifying specific areas needing minor additions like module-level learning objectives and explicit activity-to-outcome connections.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nClayn has strong pedagogical convictions centered on student agency and authentic assessment. They emphasize that readings should be optional and diagnostic-driven rather than required, and their ungrading philosophy intentionally avoids rigid rubrics to maintain flexibility across diverse career fields and writing contexts. They've learned that students respond more authentically to conversational AI prompts rather than explicit writing assignments, using AI conversations to naturally elicit reflection.\n\nKey principles include eliminating problematic elements from previous course versions (ClickUp, Kanban boards, group work, conferencing) while maintaining course flexibility with clear structure. They believe in using AI tools to support rather than replace student thinking, and in requiring external professional validation of student writing projects to ensure career relevance.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn's approach emphasizes collaborative course development, working systematically through QM standards while maintaining pedagogical integrity. They direct students to OER materials in Perusall for concept learning, keeping activities diagnostic rather than instructional. The course structure provides clear progression while avoiding hard deadlines, supporting diverse student pacing needs.\n\nTheir decision-making process involves careful consideration of how changes align with both QM requirements and their core educational philosophy, often pushing back on suggestions that would conflict with their student-centered approach. They demonstrate attention to detail in course materials, requesting corrections and verification to ensure accuracy in documentation like APA citations.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nClayn uses Google Drive extensively for course development and document management, with specific folders like \"ENGL 1101 Spring 2026\" containing comprehensive course materials. They work with six Open Educational Resources including technical writing texts by various authors and an APA style guide from Idaho State University. The course integrates Perusall for student engagement with OER materials and uses Claude as an integrated learning tool throughout the writing process.\n\nThey have multiple Claude projects for different course development initiatives and seek peer-reviewed research to support their ungrading and self-assessment practices for QM review documentation.", "019a938d-b72c-704b-8aa7-20b9f406fa94": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is an instructor at Idaho State University developing innovative, AI-integrated courses that emphasize student agency and self-directed learning. Their work focuses on creating educational experiences that move away from traditional top-down instruction toward approaches where students explore and construct knowledge through AI-facilitated conversations and self-assessment. This pedagogical philosophy centers on giving students the right to succeed or fail based on their own choices, with high tolerance for varied pacing and learning paths.\n\nCurrent courses include ENGL 1101 (composition with 24 students split between traditional and support-intensive sections) and TGE 1257 Ethics (using an \"archaeological approach\" where students excavate their own moral reasoning). Both courses eliminate traditional grading in favor of comprehensive self-assessment systems where students document their learning journey and make evidence-based cases for their final grades.\n\nA key priority is achieving Quality Matters certification for these courses, requiring detailed self-reviews against higher education standards while maintaining pedagogical integrity and innovative approaches.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn is actively conducting Quality Matters self-reviews for both ENGL 1101 and TGE 1257 courses for Spring 2026. The TGE Ethics course recently achieved a perfect 103/103 QM score after iterative refinements, while ENGL 1101 scored 97/103 with minor gaps in feedback timing specifications.\n\nBoth courses are structured around shared Google Drive folders that provide real-time visibility into student work, enabling a \"monitoring + strategic intervention\" model. This approach involves weekly instructor monitoring of student progress with targeted interventions when students stall or show concerning patterns, rather than constant feedback on all work.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nA core insight has emerged around sustainable feedback models for self-paced, AI-integrated courses. Rather than feeling \"hollow\" about AI handling routine feedback, Clayn has developed frameworks that focus instructor energy on strategic moments: required checkpoints, proactive outreach for disengaged students, and office hours support.\n\nThe pedagogical approach emphasizes student autonomy over instructor control, believing that meaningful learning happens when students wrestle with concepts independently rather than receiving constant evaluative commentary. This philosophy extends to grading, where self-assessment becomes a learning tool rather than just an evaluation method.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nCourse design follows a consistent pattern of combining innovative pedagogy with rigorous quality standards. Each course undergoes comprehensive QM self-review using detailed rubric analysis, with iterative refinements based on gaps identified.\n\nThe feedback model centers on \"monitoring + strategic intervention\" - weekly progress monitoring through shared folders, required checkpoints at key course moments, and proactive outreach when students are inactive for extended periods. This balances student autonomy with appropriate instructor support.\n\nDocumentation and revision processes are thorough, with detailed attention to policy language, accessibility requirements, and alignment with institutional standards while preserving innovative approaches.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nGoogle Drive serves as the primary platform for course delivery and student work visibility, with shared folders enabling real-time progress monitoring. Quality Matters Higher Education Rubric 7th Edition provides the framework for course quality assurance.\n\nAI tools are integrated as \"thinking partners\" for students rather than replacement for human instruction. Course materials emphasize OER (Open Educational Resources) and career-relevant projects that connect academic work to professional contexts.", "019ad688-fd7c-747b-b43f-bfb96d03defb": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is running an extensive one-on-one D&D 5e campaign where Claude serves as Game Master and they play Johannes Constantinius, a human warlock bound by a fiendish pact. The campaign centers on Johannes's curse - a demonic contract that killed his entire military unit and now requires yearly tribute of magical artifacts to prevent harm to those around him. The overarching goal is finding a way to break this pact while serving the resistance against the Dragon Army in the Dragonlance setting.\n\nKey companions include Kessa \"Keys\" Darrow (rogue/bard), a charming con artist who discovered Johannes's curse and helps acquire artifacts, and Brother Cyrus (cleric), who joined after extensive moral discussions about their methods. The campaign has evolved from small-scale rescue operations to coordinated military actions, with Johannes now serving as Senior Commander of Special Operations for Haven's resistance forces.\n\nThe campaign emphasizes tactical combat with detailed mechanical descriptions, stealth and reconnaissance, strategic planning, and meaningful character interactions when purposeful. Clayn prefers \"crunchy but not world at stake\" adventures that balance lighter content with meaningful stakes, avoiding both overly dark themes and trivial content. They specifically dislike heavy political storylines but engage deeply with character development and moral complexity.\n\n**Current state**\n\nJohannes has progressed to level 10 (Warlock 9/Fighter 1) and established significant strategic assets including Warehouse 47 as their base of operations in Palanthas. The party has achieved major victories including defeating an ancient aboleth, liberating 700 prisoners from Pax Tharkas, breaking a 300-year curse at Dargaard Keep, and forging an unprecedented alliance with black dragon Khisanth.\n\nRecent sessions have focused on \"Chronicle 10: The Frozen Crown\" - a complex three-phase military operation to prevent the Dragon Army from awakening and controlling an ancient primordial entity. The party successfully infiltrated Icewall Glacier, sabotaged excavations, captured key researcher Dr. Seris Vanthar, and is now preparing to steal the Crown of Binding artifact from Frosthold Fortress.\n\nJohannes currently has approximately 7-9 months remaining on his patron tribute deadline. The party has developed prototype Resonance Network telepathic communication devices and maintains multiple strategic alliances across the resistance network.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nThree major mission arcs remain available: completing the Icewall Expedition (stealing the Crown of Binding), the Silvanesti Insertion (rescuing a missing Senator with crucial intelligence), and Neraka Infiltration (disrupting ritual preparations). The party has split forces strategically, sending captured assets to safety while the core team attempts the high-risk fortress infiltration.\n\nJohannes continues seeking opportunities to break his fiendish pact, particularly interested in connections between his infernal patron curse and the Dragon Army's binding magic. The recently acquired Binding Tome offers potential knowledge for breaking demonic contracts, representing the most promising lead toward his primary objective.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nJohannes has learned to use \"malicious compliance\" with his patron - technically fulfilling contracts while preventing catastrophic outcomes, such as destroying the Vast Gate components while presenting them as tribute. He's discovered that worthiness with divine artifacts means serving them rather than wielding them for personal gain, leading to strategic decisions like giving the Disks of Mishakal to Goldmoon.\n\nThe campaign has established that surgical strikes and intelligence gathering are more effective than direct confrontation. Diplomatic solutions can achieve strategic objectives while minimizing casualties, as demonstrated in the unprecedented territorial agreement with Khisanth. Character redemption requires profound transformation rather than simple comfort - meaningful stakes create opportunities for growth and healing.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn consistently demonstrates sophisticated tactical thinking, preferring methodical planning, reconnaissance, and stealth approaches over direct assault. They emphasize delegation and strategic coordination, using Johannes's leadership role to orchestrate complex multi-phase operations. Combat tactics focus on Johannes's Eldritch Blast specialization with shadow magic, following a \"appear from shadows, obliterate target, vanish\" approach.\n\nDecision-making prioritizes gathering intelligence before action, maintaining operational security, and respecting proper authority structures. Clayn requests that Claude handle all dice rolling for narrative immersion and prefers detailed mechanical descriptions during combat. They maintain meticulous campaign records and frequently request comprehensive summaries for continuity between sessions.\n\nThe user engages enthusiastically with meaningful roleplay when it serves clear narrative purposes but avoids extended social manipulation or heavy political intrigue. They show particular attention to equipment optimization, resource management, and long-term strategic investments like the Resonance Network development project.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nThe campaign utilizes extensive reference materials from D&D Duets for one-on-one gameplay optimization, along with standard 5e resources including Player's Handbook, Monster Manual, and SRD materials. Clayn maintains detailed campaign logs across multiple Google Drive files and uses Claude's project knowledge base for continuity.\n\nAdventure modules have included Gates of Firestorm Peak, Dragons of Despair, and custom resistance operations within the Dragonlance setting. The campaign draws from classic D&D modules like Castle Amber while adapting them for solo play and the ongoing narrative arc.", "019aef6b-48b7-727e-98d0-c2818495e144": "**Purpose & context**\n\nClayn is developing a redesigned General Education Ethics Course (TGE 1257) for postsecondary CTE undergraduates, using a hybrid Canvas-BoodleBox platform approach with custom AI bots for different ethical frameworks. The project aims to create a sophisticated pedagogical system that significantly reduces syllabus content while maintaining educational effectiveness through personalized, framework-specific learning experiences. The course design involves creating multiple AI bots with distinct personalities and approaches (like Iris for Care Ethics, Prudence for Virtue Ethics, and Clodsley for Deontology) that guide students through diagnostic protocols and framework-specific questioning.\n\n**Current state**\n\nClayn has made substantial progress on the course implementation, with eight bots completed and four remaining to build. The project has evolved from initial platform architecture decisions through pedagogical design to concrete bot implementation using validated templates. Recent work has focused on tracking design decisions and their evolution across multiple chat transcripts from November through December 2025, requiring careful documentation of when ideas entered the project, when they were superseded, and identifying unresolved items that need attention.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nClayn has discovered that BoodleBox's Courses/Assignments feature solves scalability challenges that weren't initially apparent, leading to significant architectural improvements. The project has evolved from theoretical discussions about folder architecture and Knowledge Bank limitations to concrete implementation strategies. A key insight has been the importance of maintaining detailed project management documentation to track design decision evolution, particularly when working across multiple conversation threads and platforms that may lack proper chronological metadata.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nClayn demonstrates a systematic approach to instructional design, progressing methodically from foundational platform decisions through pedagogical frameworks to implementation details. They maintain comprehensive documentation of design decisions and their rationale, seeking to create master summary documents that track project evolution chronologically. When working with multiple transcript files lacking metadata, Clayn values thorough analysis of contextual clues, cross-references, and topic evolution to establish proper sequencing and maintain project continuity."}, "account_uuid": "0a048e5b-f605-413e-bad9-c9e6089a77b0"}]
